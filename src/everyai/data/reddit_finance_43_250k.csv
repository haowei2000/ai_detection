question,answer
Where has all the money in the world gone?,"(relix already hit on some of this)

It's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... 

All actual ""money"" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)

Imagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...

- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, ""hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall"". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard ""prices"" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. 

- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  ""Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?"" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. 

- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. 

Now, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The ""money"" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. 

So far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:

- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't ""go"" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). 

- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been ""destroyed"" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.

The above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. 

After the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. 

Now we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern ""bond""...

Is there a better sub where comments aren’t hidden 99.9% of the time?,"I someone were to make a good alternative then I'd be very happy about it. It can take ages moderating this sub. I'm sure lots of the other mods think the same.

The fundamental problem is though that loads of people who don't know about economic write replies. All sorts of bullshit gets written. The problem then is you'd have to know about economics to distinguish the bullshit from the truth.

If someone can think of a good way of solving this I'd be very happy."
How real-world corruption works.,"So I said I would talk about the US Military if this got any interest. Here goes:

The US Department of Defense (hereafter DOD) has put in place a ton of procedural protections to stave off corruption. And God knows they need protection: only in the DOD can you find a 20-something purchasing officer who knows nothing about the stuff he's buying, who makes around $30k per year, and who is in charge of a half-billion-dollar budget. 

For starters, low-paid people with large purchasing budgets are the easiest to corrupt outright. Find someone makes $30,000 per year but who has a $10m budget, and you have struck gold: it doesn't even require outright bribery. 

Just show up at their office and mention that you might have some product for them to take a look at... ""Can you spare some time this weekend? I have tickets to the playoffs if you're free... Whoa!? You're a fisherman? Let's forget about business: why not have the family come by the beach house? I just got a new boat and the stripers are running... we'll talk business later...""

Take a guy living in a military-base trailer out fishing on a yacht or to courtside seats, take him on a golf weekend, or to front-row seats at an A-list concert, hell, even just take him and his lady to a swank restaurant, and you've made a new best friend. And if he happens to be in charge of a $10m budget, that lavish night might be about to pay for itself 100,000 times over. 

And all that assumes that you did not actually have a stripper with a cell-phone camera waiting in the car after the concert... we haven't even talked about blackmail, so why bring it up? Especially considering that these days, you don't even have to blackmail someone to blackmail them-- just linking your pics to their facebook, or setting up a ""my party with Joe Blow"" web page can ruin their life without malice or legal consequence... We're just posting our own party pics!

The DOD grades proposals with a color-grading system that is basically equivalent to letter grades. 

The way it works is: the purchasing officer or whomever writes the spec (""request for quote""-- in normal business this called a ""request for proposal"" or ""RFP"". The DOD calls it an ""RFQ"". Whatever.). The spec is written as numbered sentences/paragraphs. Companies write bids that answer each number, with a bottom-line price. 

A technical review committee sees the proposals with the price and supplier blacked out, and ""grades"" each proposal based on how well it meets the spec. The purchasing officer then sees the ""grades"" from the technical review, with the prices alongside (but not the complete proposals). Depending on his instructions, he may be required to either sign for the best overall value, highest overall grade, lowest acceptable cost, etc. 

All of this seems very official and corruption-proof, until you realize that the original request for proposal came from, say, a 65-year-old Naval Admiral who knows everything about Oceanic warfare but nothing at all about computers, who assigned his 20-something first mate to write the spec and request for funding, who knows nothing about purchasing and who in turn wrote a spec (two years ago) that required Core2duo computers with 2GB ram and Windows XP and who required computers that meet the spec... 

By the time Congress approves the funding, the spec is obsolete, and it costs far *more* to buy a bunch of obsolete Core2Duo machines with 2GB RAM than it would have cost to buy more-powerful computers at Costco. 

The over-technicality and protectiveness of the DOD actually makes it one of the most vulnerable purchasing systems anywhere. As a technical officer who was interested in my product told me: ""Don't worry about the review process, we'll just let you guys write the spec"". If the military wants a Mercedes, they just issue a spec that requires a hood ornament with three lines trisecting a circle, and see whichever car company meets the spec at the best price-- surprise! They get the contract. Which means that the DOD is probably the only buyer in the world paying sticker price. "

"Why were American, minimally-skilled, workers able to afford single family homes in the 1960s and 1970s, but now they can barely afford apartments for rent?","There are lots of misconceptions around this topic.

Home ownership rates in general are higher now than in the 70's.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N

The cost of a house is also not really the plain cost of a house, it's the financing cost. And in that regard, people spend less of their disposable income on mortgages than they did at any prior point in the last 40 years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDSP

That doesn't mean houses haven't become more expensive, but that perception is in large parts fueled by the fact that they have become a *lot* more expensive in the most desirable places, the big cities that offer high salaries and a high standard of living. People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.

Another thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not gone up so drastically.

https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/houses2.jpg?x91208

Two trends are worth noting however.

People on average go to college more often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or more, this happens later in life.

Also, inequality pushes ownership rates down for the lower half and up for the upper half.

For more details, see:

https://equitablegrowth.org/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race/

So, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what and where has changed."

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Megathread: 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer,"&gt; “Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen.”

Amen - the lack of accounting for external costs has been a colossal failure.  So how do we start to address this?  Carbon taxes  is one way (preferred by many)

On the carbon tax side, the analysis of what is necessary to main temperatures according to various models is really depressing.  The costs are so high I don’t see how we’ll get there without being literally forced (as in the climate impacts are so obvious and severe they can no longer be ignored by climate deniers). And by this point the damage will be severe.

As a reference point, I’m in BC Canada and we have a carbon tax.  Currently our tax is $35/tonne.  The tax rate will increase each year by $5 per tonne until it reaches $50 per tonne in 2021.

The models proposed in the research are:

1. Baseline: no climate-change policies are adopted, over and above the limited policies already adopted in 2015.

2. Optimal: paths for climate-change policies are chosen to maximize aggregate (weighted) welfare within the model from 2015 forward.

3. Temperature-limited: optimal policy paths are chosen, subject to the further constraint that the global temperature does not exceed 2.5 ◦C above the 1900 average.

4. Stern discounting: optimal policy paths are chosen for a subjective discount rate set to 0.1% per year, as suggested in the influential Stern Review (Stern 2007).

Here are the costs for those ( sorry for poor iPhone formatting)

Carbon taxes 2010 US Dollars 

2015 2020 2025 2030 2050

Optimal (3.5C by 2100)

29.5 35.3 49.1 64.0 153.5 

Temperature Limit &lt;2.5C

184.1 229.0 284.0 351.0 1008.4 

Stern discounting at 0.1%

256.5 299.6 340.7 381.7 615.6

If we compare the costs to keep &lt;2.5C, BC's current taxes are 5X too low!  And BC is one of the most progressive provinces, other Canadian provinces are moving away from carbon taxes.  The Federal government still has plans for a federal tax but it is looking politically more risky as we go.

This does not bode well."
House of Cards - Part 3,"So in short;

The current short interest reported by FINRA from fund data on stocks is absolute bull, and always has been.

This is because funds have been found guilty of violating short interest report rules for decades, especially when their short positions were clearly illegal (i.e. naked shorting obvious).

We can also see through the ridiculous volatility and volume levels of GameStop that shorts indeed have not covered and that they're still holding unspeakable levels of short positions on the stock.

And now because the vast majority of GameStop share owners and buying and holding their shares (and if they continue to do so), the true short interest will inevitably reveal itself and we'll be in for the short squeeze of our lives."

Follow up: Appreciate all the replies, clearly a lot of apes feeling the same way about peeking behind the curtain thanks to u/atobitt. The system is clearly broken, fraudulent to its core and built upon promises from entities that have proven themselves to be completely untrustworthy. 

I think the real question from all of this is why anyone would want to participate in such a flawed system at all in the future?

I hope by being exposed for what it really is, Gary Gensler and the upcoming SEC rule changes will actually go some way to fixing it. 

And probably the only way to proceed in future is with blockchain as u/PandoraMarx has highlighted below. 

But for now this Gamestop situation is so unique and exciting, I’m holding because it feels like every single GME shareholder is playing a game that they can actually win, even with it being deliberately stacked against them from the start. 

This really is a once in a lifetime opportunity, in the immediate present for all the tendies but also for more lasting changes that level the playing field for everyone who wants the opportunity to participate in a fair market."

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 22/May/2017,"Anyone checking this out from /all: 
Ethereum is a decentralized platform based on Blockchain technology. Basically it's the technological answer to the hierarchical structure of systems that have long made up a large part of our world. There is not one person or organization that owns the system. The system us based on a open sourcecode. Anyone can build apps on the system. 

We're all very excited today because a large number of organizations have publicly stated to back the ethereum ecosystem. This has had a very positive impact on the long term confidence and has made the price rise quite substantially.

By using ethereum you can make contracts between people without the use of middleman. Those contracts are then enforced by a global computer. This has huge impact on how organizations will function, how people can trust the organizations that are running the world.

Going from hundreds of years of using a pyramid model of power to a flat, transparent and secure trust-able model is something we really need in the world right now.

The people in this thread are traders of the so called ether that fuels the system. We've all been here for different reasons. Since it's a traders sub, speculation and profit making is one of the reasons. But i'd like to think we all feel a certain pull towards the platform because we feel this can really impact the world in a positive way.

I tried to post in the Ontario Reddit that inflation was under reported and I got downvoted through the floor,"The reason you got downvoted is that you made up your own basket of goods which showed higher numbers and then compared it to the official calculation. As another person pointed out, that doesn’t mean inflation is under reported but it may not be representative of what specific individuals are spending money on. It is not under reported in relation to the previous levels of inflation as it uses the same methodology. I mean, you could use a loblaw’s sales flier and compare the items to the previous month’s prices and say inflation is down. Your approach is simply meaningless as a comparison to the official numbers. All the government calculations are readily available if you want to see how the individual sub items that you’re interested in are increasing."

It's important to remember that when we talk about large corporations, we are talking about profit margins of 1-2% per year for the extremely successful ones. Their billions of dollars is not sitting in a vault where dudes in top hats and monocles are bathing in it; ita tied up in assets, investments, and people. 

That is to say, the company is one of the tools through which money is distributed into the economy, and this tool works as a value multiplier. Losing a 50bn chunk of the economy by allowing the companies to collapse would possibly 500bn or more in damage to the public. 

We'd have to pay unemployment to their employees, we'd have to wash all debt for them, meaning lenders have less money and wont invest as confidently elsewhere, we'd have to store or destroy their fleets (who's gonna buy all the planes?), regional government will lose income from property tax on office buildings, etc. The list goes on. 

So its not as simple as ""well they're gonna go out of business, sucks for them"". The collateral damage would be extensive."

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 22/May/2017,"I hope this doesn't get lost in the middle of all the moon comments and excitement, but here's a slightly more serious post. Food for thought:

- Stop being so greedy. 

Remember that this is a fairly risky investment (it doesn't feel like it because we are in a super bull market). Are you okay with losing 50% of your investment? Are you okay with losing 80% of it? Even if you think so, know that people vastly overestimate their ability to handle downturns. 

No matter what you do, make sure that there will still be food on the table if eth goes to 0. 

- Stop watching the damn charts and hold

Get out there and enjoy life. I'm a hypocrite because I spent more time on this sub than I've spent at work today, but the price will swing up or down whether you watch the charts or not. I bet most of you aren't actually trading - but you're glued to the charts due to all the excitement from eth taking off--but hey, you and I both knew it would take off. 

LASTLY, and by far the most important...

'Big Short' Investor Michael Burry Says Nancy Pelosi's Chip Stock Buy Should Be Illegal,"So easy to mitigate something like this:

* You and your spouse cannot purchase individual stocks or options while you are serving in Congress. Only index funds.
* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.
* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.

These three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent. If you're a politician who is 'serving the public', investing in stocks shouldn't be a priority for you as it has been for Nancy."

OMG!!!!
Read this: 

With the above groundwork laid, let me try to explain how market makers get short even if they like the Company; 
Lets say that a stock (shell) has been lying quietly at $.25 bid $.50 offered. A limit order comes into one of the MM's 
to Buy at $.50 for a thousand shares. Prior to this trade that MM may be ""flat"" (neither long or short any shares). He 
fills the order and is now short 1,000 shares. He may raise his bid hoping to find a seller to ""flatten"" out his position. 
But before he realizes it a wave of buyers have come in and cleared out all the $.50 offers. Now the stock is $.50 bid 
.75 offered. Here comes that ""Big"" firm he just sold the 1,000 shares to at .50 with another bid for 1000 at .75. He 
makes this print. Now he is short 2,000 at an average of .625. The market keeps moving and now its .75 bid 1.00 
offered. Now he has to make a decision. 

Just like investors, MM Hate to take a loss. So 9 times out of 10 he will now sell 2000 at 1.00 making him short 4000 
but with an average .81. At this time he would love to see a seller at .75 so he can cover his short and make a few 
bucks. 

But instead the market keeps moving up. Now it is 1.00 to 1.25 and here comes the buyer again at 1.25. He doesn't 
want to lose the call so now he needs to sell 4,000 at 1.25 to keep his break even point above the bid. Now he is 
short 8,000. Market moves up to 1.25 bid 1.50 offer here comes the buyer now he feels he must sell 8000 here 
because ""stocks don't go up forever"". 

Now he is short 16,000. And so on and so on. If the stock keeps moving up, before he realizes it he could be short 
50k or 100k shares (depending how big his bank is). _________________________ 

Finally the market closes for the day and on paper he may look all right in that his ""break even"" price may be around 
the closing price. But now he has to figure out how to entice sellers so he can cover this short. It is important to 
note that if this happened to one MM it has probably happened to most all of them. 

Some ways MM's entice sellers; Run the stock up with a ""tight spread"" in a fast market, then ""open"" up the spread to 
slow down the buying interest. After it has ""cooled off"" for a little while lower the offer below the last trade right 
after a small piece trades on the offer then tighten the spread so that the sellers feel they can take a ""quick profit""
by ""hitting the bid"" on the tight spread. 

Once the selling starts the MM's will walk it down quickly by only making small prints on the way down with the tight 
spread. Another way is by running the stock up in the morning, averaging up their short then use the above 
technique to walk it down in the afternoon. 

Hopefully after doing this for several days, it will demoralize the buyers. The volume will dry up and the sellers will 
materialize thinking that the game is over. 

Contrary to popular opinion, MM usually Do Not Cover in Fast moving markets either Up or Down if they are short. 
They Short More. They usually try to cover after the frenzy is out of the market. There are many other techniques 
they use but the above are the most popular. 

This technique works about 9 times out of 10 particularly in a BB market. However that is because 9 out of 10 BB 
stocks are BS. Remember what I said above. Most MM's don't have a clue as to the value of a Company until they 
get trapped. If the Company has solid fundamentals and a bright future. Then the stock will do very well. And the 
activity that caused the situation will prove to even help the future stock activity because it created an audience.""

"The Ford Model T sold for $260 in 1925, which is $4,056 in 2021 dollars. Today, the cheapest car on the market is the Chevrolet Spark LS at $15,695. Even if today's cars are way better, why haven't efficiency increases and automation, brought car prices more in line with the Model T's?","In my opinion, two aspects of your question are wrong. First, Model T's are not nearly as long-lasting as modern cars (given the needs of modern drivers). Model T's were engineered well for their time, had top speeds around 40 MPH, and could last as many as 20,000 miles before the engine needed a rebuild (not to mention its wooden wheels!). That said, a Model T does not have a fuel pump, water pump, oil pump, fuel filter, oil filter, distributor or single ignition coil among other parts that commonly fail in modern cars. 

Second, modern motorized vehicles with similar capabilities to the Model T can be purchased for less than $4,000. Examples include buggies/go-carts, UTV/ATVs, motor scooters/motorcycles, and maybe kit cars.

c) both GME and Movie STock with IDENTICAL chart patterns and IDENTICAL halts

d) HUGE HUGE gap between bid and ask for GME 0.02 bid and 600,000 ask

same for movie stock

e) Halts and patterns being identical between two stocks, both about to short squeeze is INSANE. For it to happen on one stock would be ABSURD. for it to happen on two stocks, at exact same time is just crazy

it's one thing to say - they are in same basket so price has same pattern. It is BEYOND ABSURD that both were halted at EXACT SAME TIME

""What a great post!

As I read through that, I started to have some thoughts about how the MM's vulnerability might be used to burn them out, but I'm not sure if I've really thought it through enough yet. I guess it's more of a fantasy scenario, but it goes something like this:

1. Company has 100 million shares outstanding, and the ""cellar box"" tactic begins with no bid/offer .0001. Now, pretending that I'm a stuckholder who happens to have substancial financial resources (I don't but some on these boards might), here's what I might do.

2. First, I figure out that as long as the outstanding shares is equal to 100 million, I can theoretically buy this entire company for $10,000. But not if there is dilution. Gotta head that off at the pass.

3. I visit the company and talk to the board/ceo or whoever I need to in private and say ""Look, these MM's are KILLING your company, and they're killing me on other positions I own with these tactics. Let's work together. Don't dilute your share base. Let me buy you out instead under an agreement where I will turn control back over to you at a certain specified date, or if certain conditions are met.""

4. They say ""But we have to dilute!!! We can't pay the bills this month if we don't."" And I say, ""Bills Schmills!!! I will personally loan the company the money it needs each month to meet its payroll and bills, and I'll do it at BELOW PRIME!""

5. So in my fantasy world, they agree to this. Then I start buying up shares. $10,000 worth. $20,000. $40,000. $70,000. $100,000!!!!!

6. Wait a second, how can I have so many shares? I've got like a BILLION shares here in my account, yet the company only has 100 million outstanding and available for trading. Well I know perfectly well how I got them; the MM's sold them to me through naked short selling.

7. But the company never diluted, because here I am loaning them the cash to pay their bills.

8. Now I pick up my phone, and call my broker. I ask how many shares I have, and I'm told 1 Billion. With a big smile I say ""Thank you. I'd like you to send the certificates to me please....""


Now I'm not sure if this makes sense yet because it just kind of occured to me as I read your post.

Thoughts anyone?

I think I'm done with a regular job. I want to day trade full time - advice?,"In my opinion, every trader should have these before going full time.

1. At least 6 months of savings covering all expenses.

2. A failure plan. It may sound like a bad mentality but it's better to be prepared. I recommend a max loss. If you hit it, walk away before you lose all your money. My plan is simple - if I have one negative month, I hit the job market. If I miss my goal 3 months in a row, I hit the job market.

3. Make a goal. That can be either daily, weekly or monthly. People that trade on the side have flexibility with their goals but you're going to be trying to replace your income. It's important to know how much you need to make.

4. A real desire to trade for a living. There's no boss and there's no salary. Staying motivated can be difficult if your biggest motivation is not having a real job. 

5. A strategy that has worked consistently in live trading. Not paper trading and not back testing. Both of those are important but it's even more important that your strategy holds up when there's real money and real emotions on the line. 

6. Profits. Your strategy should already be making you the money you want to make before you go full time. I recommend 2 years of consistent profits to see if your strategy holds up with changing market environments but it should be at least 6 months."

Trading212 restricts the purchase of certain stocks under guise of “mitigating risk”,"I've posted a bit on this on the T212 reddit, but:

They have a fiduciary responsibility to protect their customers' interests.

And yes they can control risk. It's exactly the same reason why they can't offer excess leverage to retail clients and can close out positions. Halting trading for this reason is not new. It has happened across the board with plenty of brokers in the past.

The FCA handbooks cover this. They could be liable to FCA sanctions if it transpired they were offering easy access to completely non-qualified investors and they all ended up losing huge sums and made FCA complaints.

Say GME dumps at open (which it is completely possible), I feel people won't be complaining.

They've said in that notification, this is partly to do with trading volumes (which have been crazy) and their servers will just melt again and people will be stuck in orders when the market potentially dumps this.

So T212, a free service, should upgrade all their servers and increase capacity in the space of 2 days, purely because every man and his dog has decided to pile into a handful of stocks the last few days (fuelled by a reddit forum)?

This happens, it's happened loads on the past with all brokers across the board and this issue wasn't specific to T212 yesterday.

People that have qualified themselves as pro investors, have literally become traders overnight and are complaining 'manipulation' etc...

Yes it's really shit to everyone stuck in orders, but what did you expect!!! Experienced investors will have stayed well clear of this and only invested what they can afford to lose, knowing it's a complete gamble!

The FOS are going to say T212 looks after the interests of **all** its users and were trying to decrease server volatility whilst literally millions of people were piling into a few names at a time there was also no liquidity.

Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac were taken down by naked short selling that prevented them from raising capital. The housing default crisis was bad but manageable with enough capital. The accusation here is the market maker (Goldman) was flooding the market with naked shorts:

Take a look at Section H in particular. Despite the ownership being 100% accounted for, the float was traded several times in a very short period. Sound familiar?

I do agree that they royally fucked up with GME. It was supposed to be shorted to death and die by the default of its loan, sold off, bankrupted, delisted. Same fate as Fannie and Freddie and many other small companies. Instead, it purged the board and used the sky high stock value to pay off its loan. This is bigger than anyone realizes. The loan was 80% of GME's market cap last year. It's the equivalent of lifting yourself out from under a burning car by flipping it over and then putting out the fire with your own piss. The apes are now on the hunt for the people who set the car on fire."
Why are so many Americans living above their means?,"Everyone I know makes about the same amount of money as me and yet they have nicer houses, cars, etc. They're all in massive debt.

Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs is going to lift me out of living paycheck to paycheck.,"That is awesome, brother! 

Cost Plus Drugs has been a lifesaver for me as well. One of my medications went from $163 for a 90 day supply to $5.16. My other two went down as much. Even better I was able to get my scripts written as 1 year supply so I don't have to pay the $5 shipping fee 4x per year. I could never have afforded that when it was $163 for a 90 day supply, but now that a year is only $25 and change it is possible. I'll be putting the other $$$ I had allocated for my medication into savings so I can hopefully retire someday, too."
"Why is the Canadian economy such a basket case, when compared to America, or Asia?","Population of:

- Canada: 38 million

- USA: 328 million 

- Asia: 4.5 billion

- China: 1.4 billion

- Japan: 126 million

- South Korea: 51 million

- Portugal 10 million

- Belgium 11 million

Canada has always been an economy focussed on exporting natural resources from the time it was feeding Europe resources, continuing through the age of the USA. With its population it has done very well, but is better compared to Belgium, South Korea and other small countries next to giant economies.

“Advanced” stuff requires large educational sectors that attract the attention of the world, and large investment, research and development sectors, large government support, and mostly a lot of money from a large economy. Canada has a larger share of these things and punches well above its weight (ie/participation in space development) but it is always going to be a small fish in a very large pond."
I’m 68 and retiring with $700000,"$30K from $700K is a 4.2% SWR (safe withdrawal rate). This is well within the 4% threshold describe by the [Trinity Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study). I.e. you can start by taking out $30K the first year. The next year, you adjust the $30K for inflation and take that out. There is a 95% chance your money will last and a very good chance it will actually grow.

The Trinity Study used a time horizon of 30 years. Your life expectancy at 68 is 16m/18f but you have to allow that you could live longer. 

A key decision though is how to allocate your money between stocks and bonds. Typical advice might be 60/40 or 50/50. The problem is that bonds are now at a historically low rate.

A second issue is that the equity market [CAPE Shiller Ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is currently very high. This indicates that equities may be over valued and that the market is due for a correction. The further implication is that you face a larger chance for a [sequence of returns risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sequence-risk.asp).

The other realistic option you have is to purchase an annuity. Just off the top of my head, I believe you could get an annuity which would return even more than the amount you want to spend each year. The problem is that the annuity probably would not be inflation adjusted.

Schwab offers a fixed immediate income calculator here: https://www.schwab.com/annuities/fixed-income-annuity-calculator

I get a rough estimate of 42K / year for a the situation you describe assuming you are a male. Female would pay worse due to longer life expectancy.

Later in life when you have the money to buy the toys after decades of investing, you realize that the toys are boring and the memories are what you value. The journey *was* the reward, and getting to the end kind of sucks.

Realtor reselling condo 3 days after closing,"A Realtor is a real estate agent who is a member of the National Association of Realtors. If your real estate agent is a Realtor (almost every one of them is), you should contact your state board of Realtors and let them know you believe your real estate agent has behaved unethically. 

A real estate agent encouraging you to take an offer before a property hits the open market and then turning around and helping the new owner list it on the open market - that sounds like they weren’t looking out for your best interests. 

You should also call your state bar association and ask for a consultation. It’s usually free, and a lawyer may take your case without up front pay if they believe there’s a good chance for damages. 

Pursue this. Do not ignore or cut your losses. You may be owed the additional value of the property plus four times that amount. This is also why real estate agents have to carry insurance.

Edit: Want to explicitly say that this may be a misunderstanding or a unique circumstance. This may also be a run of the mill practice that is not being fully appreciated through this Reddit post. Ultimately, we’re just random people with no particular understanding of the situation. I might be a twelve year old. Document - screenshot listings, keep copies of your correspondence. Get a free consultation with someone who will give you actual advice, like a lawyer. Specifically, seek out a lawyer who has experience in real estate. As mentioned above, state bar association is a good start."
"FatFIRE is for suckers, I decided to FILE - Live Early.","You sound convinced, and that’s the only person that matters here.

"Tried to keep my FIRE situation secret but, family found out. What to do next?","My parents have a family member who kinda learned of their FIRE scenario.

So every time this family member asks for money, my mom first demands to look at their pay stubs and where the money goes. If they can show her that 90% or more of the paycheck went to legitimate expenses, she will help. Turns out this family member spends about 60% of their paycheck on going out to the bar, going out to dinner, and other stupid stuff.

So my mom says she will start helping once she is given full control over the person's finances and sets up a tight spending budget. All of a sudden this person doesn't need help anymore... strange!

OP, I would suggest instead offering to help them get on track financially. Kill 'em with kindness and overly supportive finance advice. Be overly positive about helping them be more like you. They'll back off eventually if you can keep pushing this conversation, especially if it comes up around other friends and family. ""I've told you 10 times mom, I'm willing to help you budget like I do. I'm not paying your bills when you refuse to accept help with spending habits"".

Edit: thank you for the gold!

Edit2: thanks for the silver!

Also wanted to add an interesting way to look at things. If someone blows their money on a vacation and cannot afford to pay their bills, but then you ""help them out"" with their bills, you are essentially funding the vacation since the money normally saved for bills was used elsewhere. This is why you don't give people money to help them financially."

NAMASTE TECH. NV,"This is NOT A DD POST. Read on.

I am all for Namaste, been in it since 0.20$ but I am sorry I have to poke holes in your DD, for one this is not a DD because it doesn’t include any of the risks or the downfall they might face in the future. This is just a cheerful advertisement wrapped in a DD tag. 

Secondly they have had awful bad rep in the past and their stock history shows it. They also blew it big time in 2018.

Thirdly their stock history also shows a clear sign of pump and dump behaviour and I am highly skeptical that the same situation is happening once again with Namaste since “weed” stocks are the new fad. And people just want to pump and dump it. I be surprised if we don’t see these “DD” posts about Namaste showing up more and more in the next few days all saying the same positive things with no negatives in different subreddits and then youtube and stuff.

To everyone reading this (if downvotes permit it to live) always do your own DD don’t just jump on hype wagon on a company that has no long term potential, short term gain is nice but more often than not these “DD” posts are made with people already invested in these stocks at lower prices and they want your support to pump it up more and dump it. You are left with the bag.

Please, please with smart and responsible with your investments and hard earned money.

Just so we clear this is not financial advice, only my personal opinion and I am selling all my positions when it hits 0.5 CAD this is not a long play stock for me based on my own DD for myself.

Is a stock market crash like the ones in 1929 and 2008 impending?,"On this subreddit we mods don't like predictions about stock-market crashes. They are notoriously tricky, for the reason already given by another commenter.

It is fairly easy though, to explain why the current situation is so troubling. I'm going to concentrate on that.

During the pandemic the Federal Reserve performed very expansionary monetary policy. Other Central Banks across the world did something similar. As it turned out that policy was too expansionary. Inflation was caused by various factors including pandemic-induced supply chain problems and the expansionary monetary policy.

As a result, inflation has been high for quite a while now. Over on /r/badeconomics Integralds gives [the path of the CPI price-level compared to the Fed's aim](https://i.imgur.com/Pfn9szI.png). The price level is now far higher than the Fed's intended path. Since 2020 inflation has averaged 5.25% rather than the 2% aim. If inflation went to 0% next month and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's intended price-level path.

This leads us to the current problems. The Fed must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary. It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.

This affects the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)

When thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year. Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that, but conventional economics does not give an answer."

Thoughts on UK economy under Truss?,"Economist here. The main problem is that the budget was basically a gamble. The tax cuts weren’t funded and rely on economic growth to make up the reduced tax revenue. Economic growth isn’t forecast to be very good in the short term and the UK has a low medium to long term growth forecast when compared to other developed economies. This means that there is a strong chance that the UK government will need to borrow money to pay for it. High borrowing isn’t always negative but if this happens there isn’t anything to show for it. If borrowing was high to, say, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, then the lower energy costs in the future offset the borrowing. The markets can’t see what the benefit is here. It may work and it may stimulate the economy but it is strange timing with interest rates working against it at the same time.  
  
Taking my economist’s hat off for a second, my colleagues are all of the opinion that the new government is displaying economic illiteracy and that in itself is fuelling the negative sentiment. I can’t comment on this though."

"Mark Cuban AMA at 9:30 AM CST, Tuesday 2/1/2021","Ask Cuban if he would publicly ask the SEC to find the shares to cover in order to get GME off the threshold securities list(30 days+)? This is simply enforcing its own rules against naked shorting. WSB honorary mod and legend status if he gets the SEC to commit to a date of enforcement. 

What would he do about the FTD and short interest? No company should be shorted over 100%. So obviously the HFs/MM know where the shares are at, right? It’s curious this can’t be resolved. 

My suspicion is these hedgies are committing securities fraud or something else nefarious that they are attempting to cover. But what do I know. 

Does he think they are trading counterfeit shares, cooking books or tricking the algos to show a false downward pressure? There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. 

What does he think GME’s share price is going to? It was trending to the 700-1000+ easily before intervention, the gamma squeeze was happening before everyone’s eyes. Investors are holding long, sentiment is extremely high and positive, a huge user base still can’t buy, shorts continue to bleed; that doesn’t sound bearish. SI is still likely &gt;100%. The only thing that truly changed was the ability to buy which remains THE problem now.

What does he think about if there is a conflict of interest of Citadel bailing out Melvin who has a massive short on GME? And possibly leaning on RH to prevent buying of these securities. Questionable ethics and backgrounds of MC, citadel, Point72 and RH. Obviously we don’t know the full story for some reason since the SEC is nowhere in sight. 

What should happen to Robinhood? Thoughts on the way they generate income with Citadel, and further conflicts of interest that seem fairly obvious? Is RH done to him?

What should happen to citadel, a company exploiting data to reap massive profits with impunity, in this case to drive prices down to save their buddies?  Coordinating short ladders attacks while working in secrecy; operating in non available hours (ah trading, during halts) to manipulate people sentiment, limiting volume through brokerage leans.  These guys are truly the predators of the financial world, casting doubt and fear among retail investors with infinite resources to do so. This has been on display and is still ongoing.

What does he think about the obviously discoverable short attacks and market manipulation against retail investors that have happened for the last 3 days and driven the price down artificially on no trading volume? This includes the continued prevention of purchasing shares.

Help me understand how the FED can just print a dozen Trillion USD without any noticeable consequences,"An attempt at an ELI5:

Let’s say I tip a bartender a $1. That bartender buys a $1 drink from the deli. That deli owner uses that $1 dollar to buy something, and so on and so forth.

A while lot of people are going to say they made $1. Total income from that $1 will exceed one dollar since that same dollar was used over and over again.  

But if I think, “oh, I might need this dollar later” and stick it in my sock drawer, all those transactions won’t happen. Economic activity falls. Incomes fall. Prices may even decrease as everyone on that chain of economic activity saw their income fall when I broke the chain by stuffing the money in my sock drawer. 

If the Fed goes out and buys something for $1, the hope is it’ll start the same chain of economic activity my $1 did. 

But the bar is closed. So it skips step one and goes and buys the drink at the deli.  But no one is shopping much, so that deli owner doesn’t want to buy stuff either, so they just stuff it in their sock drawer.

So now the Fed has to introduce another dollar in hopes of starting up the chain. But everyone just keeps sticking them in their sock drawers. 

Yes, sure, there’s tons more dollars, but they’re not being used. 

$1 being used 5 times is the same as 5 one dollar bills used once each before being stuffed in the sock drawer. In both cases it’s $5 worth of transactions. Since it’s the same dollar amount funding the same number of transactions, prices aren’t going to go up. 

The potential problems come later when people start spending normally and everyone busts open their sock drawers and all those dollars that had gone unused start competing with each other to buy stuff. 

Me, the deli owner, everyone pulls out their dollar and start bidding up the price of things. 

That’s when inflation would happen.

And the Fed’s idea is that, at this point, it starts selling all the stuff it bought when it introduced those dollars, and does so until those dollars are removed from the economy, and it’l returns back to how things were at the beginning.

That’s the goal. That’s the hope. 

It doesn’t always work though. That may not be able to undo it and we’ll see the inflation. 

or people never bust open their sock drawers, and so no matter how often the Fed prints more and more money, nothing happens. 

In fact, if people keep stuffing them in sock drawers faster than the fed can print them, the number of dollars being used could actually decrease and lead to deflation. 

That’s essentially what happened to Japan in the 1990s. They kept printing and printing and saying, “your goddamn sock drawers are overflowing with cash! Go use it!” But since no one was using it, prices kept falling. Problem is, if prices keep falling, the incentive is to hold off on buying, which means even more reason to keep it money stashed in the drawer, and the cycle perpetuates. No amount of money printing will cause inflation if no one uses the money.  Stacks of in your money in sock drawer isn’t any more inflationary than your socks are. It only becomes inflationary when you spend it. 

The real world is more complicated, but the general idea is the same. It’s not just how much money there is, but also whether or not (and how frequently) that money is being used for transactions that matters. 

So, in the end, if activity normalizes and they can unwind, no inflation. If they they can’t unwind, inflation. If activity doesn’t normalize, potentially deflation."

Obese travel tips?,"Destinations? If you’re into Maldives, go to Velaa instead. It’s better than CB. I think Maldives is pretty boring though, St Barth offers a much more rounded paradise island experience IMO. Some argue that the CB is the best hotel on St Barth, I’d go for Eden Rock though.

Do some classics, go to Paris and stay at George V. Go spend a week at FS Cap Ferrat. Spend another week relaxing in Park Hotel Vitznau before heading to MO Lake Como. Spend another week or two at FS Florence before heading to Rome for a private Vatican tour. The sky is the limit.

Why stop there? Blow 300k on a Safari with Singita, take the Belmond Andean Explorer,  go to Awasi Patagonia and spend a week or two hiking Torres del Paine. Go see the norther lights at the Deplar Farm in Iceland.

Oh yeah, don't forget to book Courchevel for this winter while there's still availability. Cheval Blanc is probably full already.

As far as travel advisors go, I’ll paste my previous comment below. A lot of the stuff about travel agency bookings being good value probably isn’t relevant to you but if you want the best of the best advising you, these are the right people.

I could write so much about this, at this point my travel agent/concierge service handles most aspects of my day-to-day life.

I've been using [Berkeley Travel](http://berkeleytravel.co.uk), a London based agency offering services globally. They charge no fees for travel, just take the standard commissions properties offer to travel agencies. However, because of this they're not really interested in clients with annual travel budgets below 250k.

Is it worth it? Absolutely. For years I used to book directly, but reading Flyertalk I eventually realised that I could save tons of money booking through somebody who has more negotiating power than me. Good agents will have contracted rates and partnership agreements with top properties, offering huge discounts and guaranteed upgrades.

For example, Berkeley is a Four Seasons preferred partner and they've managed to arrange incredible (even triple category) upgrades at multiple Four Seasons properties for me.

Money isn't the most important thing though, it's just the convenience of all of it. Before I had my PA handling my bookings for me, she's incredible but she's just not a luxury travel specialist. She'll fight for me, but she hasn't actually visited the properties I want. She's got no problem spending hours on the phone, but doesn't have direct contacts at the properties or restaurants I want to book. 

The agency I work with has me in a Whatsapp group with a bunch of people able to provide expert advice within a couple of minutes. And because they actually go to the same destinations as I do, they tend to have direct lines for restaurant managers, maitre d's, etc - often enabling them to get me last minute tables even at super busy places.

Overall, I think the most important thing is to avoid the big shops. The big ones like essentialist, mrandmrssmith and velocity black are all a disaster. You want to work with a small team of experts where everyone knows you and your preferences, not with a glorified amex concierge hiring hundreds of people with little industry expertise.

Why does no one seem to think the housing market will crash?,"Your question seems to be entirely focused on ""the hosing market"" in the United States, so I'm only going to speak to that. 

The suggestion that ""no one"" thinks the housing market will ""crash"" is just wrong.  There are plenty of people who think that. But even though home prices have risen quickly over the past year, the idea that there will be a ""crash"" is dubious. 

Yes, real estate can be used as an asset like stocks, silver, gold, bitcoin, etc., all of which saw dramatic increases in the last year. But unlike bitcoin, which only has value if people agree it has value, a house is also a consumable (i.e. a place to live).  So while bitcoin could crash to $0, real estate wouldn't ""crash"" in the same way because it has an inherent, useful value.

Looking at real estate specifically, there are (at least) three factors  driving the increase in home prices:

1. Mortgage rates are [near record lows](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html). When we ""[reduce the interest rates faced by households"" that will ""push prices up](https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs64.pdf)."" That is, when mortgage rates go down a person can afford a home with a higher sticker price because their overall monthly mortgage payment stays the same.
2. The supply of houses for sale (relative to the demand for houses) is also [near record lows](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR). When there's less supply to meet the demand, you're going to see price increases.
3. The US population keeps growing, but the amount of land remains the same. There are simply more people competing for the same sq ft of land.

The first two factors will let up eventually. When the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the Fed will raise interest rates and unwind its balance sheet. That will cause mortgage rates to rise, and prices to fall. But the Fed knows not too do that too quickly and cause a ""crash."" Likewise, higher home prices will incentivize builders to create more housing and for people to sell. But it takes time to build new housing so there wouldn't be a sudden ""crash,"" and people would be less likely to sell if there were a ""crash,"" causing supply to dry up. The third factor will continue to push prices up: The population is growing and [will continue to grow for decades to come](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf) (even considering the death rate for ""the average baby boomer""), and the amount of land isn't.

Home prices will almost certainly *rise more slowly* in the future. They might even go down a bit. But a decrease would likely occur slowly rather than as a ""crash."" A ""crash"" happens when the price declines dramatically and unexpectedly. That is unlikely because (a) homes have an inherent value, like I mentioned above, and (b) none of what I'm discussing is ground breaking. 

I'm not saying there can't be a ""crash"" in home prices. We saw that in 2008. But it's precisely *because* we have a good understanding of what happened in 2008 that we're unlikely to see it happen again.  In spite of COVID, the current [delinquency rate](https://www.corelogic.com/insights-download/loan-performance-insights-report.aspx) is dramatically lower than the mortgage delinquency rate [after the great recession](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS). A big reason for that is that lenders have been much more strict since 2008. In 2006, subprime mortgages made up [about 20%](https://www.recenter.tamu.edu/articles/tierra-grande/Lingering-Effects-of-Subprime-Lending#:~:text=Subprime%20mortgages%E2%80%94broadly%20defined%20as,to%2020%20percent%20in%202006) of the overall mortgage market, whereas today they make up less than 5%. In other words, home prices may be high today, but people with mortgages are more creditworthy and are better able to afford the mortgages.  So we're less likely to see a huge foreclosure spike, meaning we're less likely to see a dramatic increase in the number of homes for sale, meaning prices are unlikely to ""crash,"" per se.

"I've seen a lot of posts in the last few days, accusing Britain of stealing $45 trillion of India's wealth. How rich was India that it had so much and how did the British manage it nevertheless?","I was trying to track down the original article by Utsa Patnaik but I couldn't find it. Part of where that $50 trillion comes from is the ""compounding at 5%"" assumption. 5% is a very high interest rate over 250 years - £1 in 1772 compounded forward at 5% becomes nearly £200,000 in 2022. If you only adjusted for UK inflation, which averaged 1.9% over the last 250 years, £1 in 1772 only becomes about £100 in 2022. To try and make sense of the influence of that we can look at the average flow of transfers per year between 1765 and 1938 that you'd need to get to $45 trillion with compounding to the present day at 5%; [I calculate that as $9 million per year](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%2845*10%5E12%29%2F%28%5Csum_%7Bx%3D80%7D%5E%7B253%7D+1.05%5Ex%29), which is still a large sum, but if you change the compounding rate to 2% you instead get a total of $69 billion - almost a thousand times less than the figure Patnaik suggests. So the compounding assumption makes a big difference to the total figure.

Still, is a flow of $9 million a year accurate? It's certainly true that there was a good deal of direct wealth extraction by British people from India, with a minority of British people involved with the East India Company getting filthy rich at the expense of Indians, to say nothing of the direct human rights atrocities and murder (William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's ongoing *Empire* podcast has some vivid details about what the British did in India). But there's a specific figure claimed here. Patnaik seems to equate ""drain"" with India's export surplus. Usually, exports are not a drain on a country because the countries that import the goods have to pay for them with something. The argument Patnaik makes is that the colonial setup allowed the British effectively to get exports from India without paying anything for them, so that the total value of the exports was all drained from India. Whether that's true is both an economic and a historical claim, and I don't know enough about the history to evaluate it. But [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gc3ifr/utsa_patnaik_claims_that_the_british_siphoned_45/fp9yyx0/) on /r/AskHistorians argues against the claim that all exports from India constituted drain, which would imply Patnaik is also overstating the flow of resources from India.

The 1.6 trillion people died figure is surely a typo for billion, a trillion is simply not a possible figure and it's not claimed by the other sources. The 1.8 billion deaths figure [seems to come from assuming](https://countercurrents.org/polya201111.htm) that if the British had not ruled India, the annual death rate for India over the entire period would be 11 per 1000, which is the death rate of the US in the early 1920s; this doesn't seem like a remotely plausible assumption to me, but I'm no more a demographer than I am a historian.

Finally, drain isn't necessarily the only way that Britain impoverished India. Acemoglu and Robinson have a lot of work on the importance of institutions in determining how fast a country grows. When the British were in India they set up institutions that were predominately extractive, aimed at taking wealth from the country rather than improving the lives of the people living there. Bad institutions can have persistent effects even after the British left, and may well have made India poorer by inhibiting its growth without actually making Britain commensurately richer."
Heads up if you have a Bank of America eBanking checking account: your account is about to be converted to one with fees,"I tried to cancel a personal checking account for BoA and they wanted to charge me an overdraft fee when they cashed out my balance by an extra 7 cents by accident.

Why is Russia still poor even though it has all the requisites to be rich?,"A well established economic relationship is that corruption reduces economic growth: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596700917037

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268019301156

The mechanics here are pretty straightforward: corruption increases costs similarly to taxes, but do not have the growth of beneficial government spending. When government taxes people / businesses there is a higher cost for whatever is taxed and therefore reduced quantity. If the government spends that tax revenue on something that promotes economic growth, then the economic growth benefits of that can even out (or in some cases even result in a net positive benefit). 

When instead individuals either impose additional costs (bribes) or cause government spending to go to non-beneficial costs (kickbacks) you get more of the negative effects and less of the positive. So growth is reduced accordingly."

A News Blackout on the Fed’s Naming of the Banks that Got Its Emergency Repo Loans; Some Journalists Appear to Be Under Gag Orders,"*Four days ago, the Federal Reserve released the names of the banks that had received $4.5 trillion in cumulative loans in the last quarter of 2019 under its emergency repo loan operations for a liquidity crisis that has yet to be credibly explained. Among the largest borrowers were JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, three of the Wall Street banks that were at the center of the subprime and derivatives crisis in 2008 that brought down the U.S. economy. That’s blockbuster news. But as of 7 a.m. this morning, not one major business media outlet has reported the details of the Fed’s big reveal.*

*On September 17, 2019, the Fed began making trillions of dollars a month in emergency repo loans to 24 trading houses on Wall Street. The Fed released on a daily basis the dollar amounts it was loaning, but withheld the names of the specific banks and how much they had borrowed. This made it impossible for the public to see which Wall Street firms were experiencing the most severe credit crisis.*

*It was the first time the Fed had intervened in the repo market since the 2008 financial crash – the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The COVID-19 crisis remained months away. The first reported case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was not reported by the CDC until January 20, 2020 and the World Health Organization did not declare a pandemic until March 11, 2020.*

*The dollar amounts of the Fed’s repo loans grew to staggering levels. On October 24, 2019, we reported the following:*

*”The New York Fed will now be lavishing up to $120 billion a day in cheap overnight loans to Wall Street securities trading firms, a daily increase of $45 billion from its previously announced $75 billion a day. In addition, it is increasing its 14-day term loans to Wall Street, a program which also came out of the blue in September, to $45 billion. Those term loans since September have been occurring twice a week, meaning another $90 billion a week will be offered, bringing the total weekly offering to an astounding $690 billion. It should be noted that if the same Wall Street firms are getting these loans continuously rolled over, they are effectively permanent loans. (That’s exactly what happened during the 2007-2010 Wall Street collapse: some teetering Wall Street casinos received, individually, $2 trillion in cumulative loans that were rolled over for two and one-half years – without the authorization or even awareness of Congress or the American people. One bank, Citigroup, received over $2.5 trillion in Fed loans, much of them at an interest rate below 1 percent, at a time when it was insolvent and couldn’t have obtained loans in the open market at even high double-digit interest rates.)”*

*Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, the Fed was legally required to release the names of the banks and the amounts they borrowed “on the last day of the eighth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the covered transaction was conducted.” The New York Fed released the information for the third quarter of 2019 last Thursday, a day earlier than required. We reported on it the following day.*

*Those Fed revelations, that had been withheld from the American people for two years, should have made front page headlines in newspapers and on the digital front pages of every major business news outlet. Instead, there was a universal news blackout of the story at the largest business news outlets, including: Bloomberg News, the Wall Street Journal, the business section of the New York Times, the Financial Times, Dow Jones’ MarketWatch, and Reuters.*

*Could this critically important story have simply slipped by all of the dozens of investigative reporters and Fed watchers at these news outlets? Absolutely not. The Fed was required to release its repo loan data and names of the banks for the span of September 17 through September 30, 2019 at the end of the third quarter of this year. We reported on what that information revealed on October 13. Because we were similarly stunned by the news blackout on that Fed release, out of courtesy we sent our story to the reporters covering the Fed for the major news outlets. Our article alerted each of these reporters that a much larger data release from the Fed, for the full fourth quarter of 2019, would be released on or about December 31. The data was posted at the New York Fed sometime before 1:23 p.m. ET last Thursday.*

*A The most puzzling part of this news blackout is that the majority of the reporters who covered this Fed story at the time it was happening in 2019, are still employed at the same news outlets. We emailed a number of them and asked why they were not covering this important story. Silence prevailed. We then emailed the media relations contacts for the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Financial Times and the Washington Post, inquiring as to why there was a news blackout on this story. Again, silence.*

*Next, we emailed a number of reporters who had covered this story in 2019 but were no longer employed at a major news outlet. We asked their opinion on what could explain this bizarre news blackout on such a major financial story. We received emails praising our reporting but advising that they “can’t comment.”*

*The phrase “can’t comment” as opposed to “don’t wish to comment” raised a major alarm bell. Wall Street megabanks are notorious for demanding that their staff sign non-disclosure agreements and non-disparagement agreements in order to get severance pay and other benefits when they are terminated. Are the newsrooms covering Wall Street megabanks now demanding similar gag orders from journalists? If they are, we’re looking at a form of corporate tyranny previously unseen in America.*"
"Congratulations on your ""depreciating asset"" OP","I posted this comment in another thread, but not everyone sees a car as a financial asset or investment. For many people owning and maintaining a car is a hobby like any other. They pay money and they get enjoyment out of it. Some people just can't understand that.

One of my hobbies is food. I really like making and eating good food and I'm willing to pay a lot for high quality ingredients and eating at fancy restaurants.

Why would I pay a bunch of money for something I shove in my face hole and shit out the next day? Why not just buy the cheapest form of nutrition I can find, like dry beans and rice, and just live on that?

Because food makes me happy.

Official Statement Regarding the WSB $GME plays,"Sometimes people in WSB give a hard time to r/dividends because they make little money and don't yolo that much, but in reality, we are all here to support and help each other out.

That sort of division leads to nowhere and we need to recognize the fact that we are handling our own money is already a victory. We are not giving it to the same people: big banks and hedge fund managers that by their greed crash the economy in 2008 and made extreme gambles such as the CDOs or charge outrageous fees and don't even beat the SPY. If you don't believe me see Warren Buffet and the bet against a hedge fund manager.

We are taking chances and we are winning, if some are not winning as much or some are losing money, we as retail investors need to support and nurture each other in the most caring way possible to lead them on a better path.

Godspeed and to the moon with your investments! Either dividends or meme stocks! 🚀🚀🚀"
"I'm wealthy, but no one knows. Can I fuck it up by keeping it as a secret?","Mate. Your SO needs to know big things like that if you wanna build a home with your SO. In fact, you should do your financial planning together, cards on the table and all.

This isn't even something about finances, this is a basic human decency/trust issue. You don't have to tell anyone else (fuck em) but your SO needs to know if you two want to be in a mutually trustful relationship for the long run.

Of course, if it's just a fling… but 5 years? Are you planning on staying together?"
How real-world corruption works.,"Thats a really well-written and illustrative story, but I would posit that this relatively minor level of corruption is probably (a) not that harmful, and (b) somewhat unavoidable.

The real issue with corruption is that it scales exponentially in terms of harm as you move from County -&gt; State -&gt; Federal.

By the time it reaches the Federal level, the corruption is not just stealing money, but writing laws and setting governmental policies.

For instance at the state level you see it with our prison-industrial complex. All the well meaning (and somewhat naive) redditors that think that people just need to be exposed to the concept of drug legalization....fail to realize that it will never happen, not for moral reasons, but for economic.

The ""black leather boot"" contract for DEA agents alone is a multi-million dollar thing. Moreover - and more insidiously - the sum total of employees working in (a) prisons, (b) law enforcement, (c) supply chain to a + b, and (d) families of all the above creates a *huge* voting block that will only vote for candidates that think throwing stoners in prison is a great idea.

This state-level corruption again grows by an exponential leap as you move upwards...eventually where Congress itself agrees to outsource its money creation ability to a private contractor (aka. The Federal Reserve). 

The resulting banking oligarchy then dictates all national and international policies to push for ever more debt. Social welfare programs are not hoisted upon us because politicians feel bad for poor people, its because the bankers know its an unending debt parade that will only grow. Ditto Wars. What a great way to force customers to continually ask for money but to plunge them into wars against concepts (ie. Global War on Terror).

I think I’m done,No shame. I would consider not selling all though. Hold even as little as 15% of your original eth just don't sell it all. You should probably still afford your down payment and you can keep your feet in ETH and use the gains to pay down the mortgage faster.  Just my 2 cents though you do you and do what you think is best.

All our favorite stocks are being shorted!,"That's to be expected, the big players have now learned to watch what's going on on Reddit to see which stocks will be pumped by users migrating left and right everytime people release a new DD. Didn't you notice that every new ticker that gets mentioned ends up going down? Someone who already has a position at a low price will release a DD to get people to buy in, then a bunch of people who were there for a long time will see their profit go up, sell tons of shares and down the shitter it goes. People can laugh all they want about Cramer, saying that when he mentions a ticker it's time to sell, but the same thing is happening with tickers mentioned on Reddit."

Bernie Sanders unveils plan to raise corporate tax rate to 35% and ban stock buybacks,"&gt;""complete an annual report that gives the compensation, gender, and racial composition of board and employees.""

Is there a legal definition for determine one's race? Like, could a half white/half Asian person simply claim to be either ""white"" or ""Asian"", and ignore the fact that they are mixed?

As demand for defacto racial quotas increase, I can't help but wonder if we will see an increasing number of people who are clearly visibly one race claim to be an entirely different race, simply because they are bold enough to play off the fact that since race is a social construct without a scientific basis, there can be no objective measurement to be used to identify the race of any given person other than the subjective human interpretation."
Who remembers the days when eth was stuck on $300,"I remember buying on day 1 of the crowd sale. Then later, during the second round of the crowd sale wherein buyers could obtain less Eth for the same amount of money, I sat on my toilet taking a shit, staring at the Ethereum Foundation Website on my HTC smart phone, thinking ""I should buy more. This might be huge."" But I passed, as 23 cents per Eth was WAY more than the 17 Cents per eth I just bought. No fool am I, I thought.  Those were the good old days, when FUDsters called us Vaporware, when VB personally responded to my reddit comments. 

I remember when Eth shot up to $7, and telling my wife about my $450 investment and how it could pay our mortgage for a year. We sold a bit at first (I now sleep on a bed that I purchased two years ago with the sale of 100 ETH). I continued to sell a bit off here and there, to pay to remodel our kitchen when a pipe burst, to pay for my Bar exam, to pay off our credit card debt so my wife could quit her job and stay home with our three young boys and not work. I've got enough left now to PAY OFF the entire mortgage and my LAW SCHOOL DEBT. 

My boys have a full-time mom, I have a career as an attorney, I'm going to be 100% debt free by the end of the year and still have some left over to...

The US spends 23% budget on healthcare but U.K. spends 20% so how can the latter afford universal healthcare but the US can’t ?,"The US Federal budget is (for FY2021) $4.829 trillion while the UK's budget (converted to dollars to keep things easier) is about $1.167 trillion.

Using the percentages you've given (which I have no reason to doubt), this means that the US will spend about $1,110 billion on healthcare while the UK will spend $230 billion

The population of the US is 328 million, which means that the US will spend, on average, $3,384 per year on each citizen.  The UK, by comparison has about 66.65 million people, which means they'll spend $3,450 per year on each citizen, again on average.

Are these dollars per person all that different?  No, they're not.  Could the US afford universal healthcare?  Almost certainly.  Should they?  Totally different question and not one I'm going into on here."
How real-world corruption works.,"Wonderful post!  This is what reddit is all about!  I hope you will continue this series, corruption101, and educate everyone how the real world works.

I have to take some minor issues with what you're saying though:

&gt;if it's no good, or if you are grossly over-charging, your customers will tend to catch on sooner or later

This ""sooner or later"" tends to be later, rather than sooner, especially if there is not much competition in the market.  Often things have to get very very bad before the customer will ditch the familiar technology for the unfamiliar.  Familiarity itself has a price.  This provides room for corruption.  As you say, you can't get too greedy here, but at the same time, there is ample room for steady corruption here, and over time this steady corruption does result in huge profits, which can then be used to fight competitors in dirty ways, such as by serving the little guys cease and desist letters.  It's not ""gun to your head"" level of corruption, but it really really hurts the country on a big scale.  It's like having sand in the gears.  Sure the gears can still turn, but the wear and tear, the heat and the friction are really crippling overall.

Finally, you overlook one important thing.  **You focus your corruption missive on the government, but really you should focus it impartially on *any bureaucracy* involving significant *delegation* of power/authority.**  One example is big corp bureaucracy.  Big corps often behave exactly like the government.  Why?  Because the principals, the owners, are often far removed, due to public ownership.  Often the biggest owners are fragmented through the mutual funds, so essentially you get companies that are ownerless, where no one is responsible.  This means that CxO level executives and the boards of directors are playing with no-one's money, because there is no single *ONE* owner out there who will tell them ""STOP THIS SHIT NOW.""  Instead, the ownership is dispersed, and for the owners to raise a stink, they have to organize first, and as you know, organizing is hard.  Power works best when it's focused and consolidated in one or few men's hands.  Power is brittle and uncertain if it's spread across a large number of people.

Corruption happens in Big Corp Inc. because the people who are in charge of purchasing decisions are *not* the end users of the products they purchase, and in addition, there is no one owner who will spank them for a bad decision.  So as long as the product they purchase is not *catastrophically* bad, executives of the Big Corp Inc. *will* get away with it.

As a normal consumer, if you purchase a phone, you are also the one who uses it.  If you don't like it, you demand a refund.  In a Big Corp Inc. you purchase a set of tools which then low level employees use.  Low level employees can complain, at which point the executives have a choice to admit they were duped, or to blame the employees for incompetence and charge them with insubordination.   And guess which will happen more often?

Corruption happens when there is delegation of power.  When you purchase on behalf of someone else.  When you execute on behalf of someone else.  Any kind of delegation involves corruption.  When you run the company for the benefit of distant and dispersed owners, you are going to fleece them in every way you can, and try to give yourself the biggest bonus you can.  If you are buying a product you don't have to use yourself, you'll buy from a company that promises you the biggest kickback instead of buying what your employees actually want to use."
Why isn't Russia going bankrupt?,"&gt;Apparently the war costs Russia [$20 Billion a day](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/7433/research-ukraine-war-costs-russian-military-20-billion-per-day),  and assuming that half of Russias $630 Billion foreign reserve remains  frozen - russia only has reserves for two weeks of war. One of which is  already over.

I don't see much of a reason to assume that Russia is spending significant amounts of reserves on the war, at least not right now.

I would consider reading that article, too. It's not just about explicit costs they have to pay for now, it's about the cost incurred by the loss of equipment and men, which actually make up the bulk of this cost.

&gt;All that wouln't really be a  problem if Russia would amass debts like any other country - but I can  hardly see anyone willing to lend them money to rebuild their army?

They can borrow, just not from the western world. China is big and has no issues lending them.

&gt;The numbers above seem to align with articels like [this](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10554269/Ukraine-DESTROYS-Russian-convoy-Zelenskys-troops-derail-Kremlin-push-Kyiv.html)

Mate just don't read the daily mail.

&gt;But the majority of news claim  the sanctions don't hurt Russia (shortterm) and the war might go on for a  long time still. How is that possible?

Surprise surprise, war is expensive. But the upfront cost is not the full 20 billion, that's loss of equipment and men for the most part. The question is more about the Russian economy as a whole really, how expensive the economic losses from diverting resources will be as well as stuff like sanctions. You can only speculate on those costs, they ultimately heavily depend on how long the war lasts as well."

"How do people become so rich, by renting properties?","It's a combination of a lot of things:

1. Cash flow: after all expenses (including maintenance, operations, and debt servicing) the extra money accumulated each month. 

2. Loan pay down: Each month, they own more and more of the property. 

3. Appreciation: assuming 30,000 is the 20% down payment, the property purchased was $150,000. Gradually, the hope is for this to appreciate over time. This also works with rents. They may break even now or minimally cash flow, but over time rents generally increase. 

4. Leverage: going off the above point, they only paid $30,000, but are able to gain appreciation on an asset worth 150,000

5. Scale: using legal tax loopholes you can trade up your property over time for larger and larger properties that can yield more of the above revenue streams at a larger scale. Trading your 150,000 building for a 300,000 building, then a 600,000 building, etc. 

6. Depreciation: using tax laws, property owners are able to depreciate their investment and reduce their tax burden, sometimes even more than the income the property produces.

$26 Should Be The Minimum Wage According to MIT (read),"Title is very misleading.

So the minimum wage should be $26/hour in *New York City?*

That does **NOT** mean that the national minimum wage should be $26/hr. Cost of living varies wildly from urban to suburban to rural areas, and even from urban areas from state to state.

I've been saying for years that minimum wage needs to be tied to a variable cost of living index and work more like sales tax where there may be a national minimum wage and then a supplement for state, county, or city based on the cost of living in that area. Could also be done by zip code or even county like the cost of living calculator breaks it down.

I live in a pretty LCOL area $26/hr is a lot of money here. One bedroom apartment prices are nowhere near $2,000 a month (I checked, they are $630/mo according to the source linked in the OP), and the ""living wage calculator"" says that a living wage in my area would be about $15/hr. Which is pretty close to our starting pay at my company, even though ""minimum wage"" is $7.25/hr.

This problem can also be attacked from a different angle, too. We desperately need to address the affordable housing crisis in this country, especially in metro areas. I don't know what the solution is but paying people more will not solve the problem, because all wages will rise and then rents will just go up as well.

That said, I do think minimum wage needs to be updated and tied to cost of living index instead of just staying the same for another 30 years."

6. You've learned your lesson and start writing CC again 
7. After X more months, ABC tanks on bad news

Starting Stock,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Unfortunately for smart blokes like you or me, you cannot simply jump into stocks and make money.  That is called day trading, and for most people, you're going to have about the same outcome as betting blindfolded in a casino.  

First, here's what you **don't** do:

* Penny stocks.  This is the game of suckers, and is a great place to lose every single cent. Nobody has a method for making tons of money from penny stocks, and if they do, they sure as shit aren't sharing it with you in a newsletter.  Might as well play roulette.
* If you invest with $500, commissions are going to eat you ALIVE.  You pay $4-7 per stock trade.  Trading with $50,000?  That's only about 0.2% that you need to make up.  Trading with $500?  You're going to be down 1-2% IMMEDIATELY after buying.  The market hasn't moved, and you're already at a loss!

So, here's what you **should** do:

1. Leave this subreddit and head over to /r/personalfinance.  They sound the same, they're miles apart.  
2. Read the links on the sidebar and in the wiki.  
3. Given as you're a teenager, you probably don't need to worry about things like paying rent, right?  Or car payments?  Your parents are helping out?  If so, you can probably gloss over the emergency fund.
4. If you do have some sort of payments you make, you will first want to put aside a couple months' expenses.  What if you get fired?  You don't want your car repossessed!  So have a backup fund like this.  Maybe you do already. 

Now, for investing!  You've got a couple options here.  

1. Retirement - if you made this money at a job, you can report it as earnings and open up a Roth IRA.  The downside?  The money won't be available for, like, 45 years.  The upside?  It will have tremendous compounding power if you start early, and is tax-sheltered: no tax penalties when you take it out.  Vanguard is most likely the best choice for a company with which to start an IRA.  However, there's a $3k minimum, so you'll need to save a bit more.  EDIT: If you pick a target retirement date fund, the minimum is only $1k - thanks to /u/doomtop for catching this.
2. Maybe you want this money back in under 45 years.  That's understandable.  In that case, open a brokerage account.  Again, Vanguard is great because you can trade all of their mutual funds for free - no commission!  See the bullet point above.  However, you'll still need a minimum of $1k to buy into their STAR funds.
3. If you're interested in individual stocks, well, see the point above with penny stocks.  Individual stocks aren't quite like flushing your money down the drain, but they are much riskier than mutual funds, and in most cases you're wagering a limited upside against a massive potential downside.  If you're going to go this route, get it in your head right now that this money is gone.  Kaput.  Flushed.  Down the drain.

I sound like a pretty pessimistic ass, don't I?  Well, I started an individual account for buying stocks back when I was a teenager.  I still have it now, half a decade later.  I put around $10k in.  It is worth $15k right now.  And unless you get incredibly lucky, you won't be generating 50% gains per year.  And if you are that lucky, you'd still be better off buying lotto tickets.

Now, I've mentioned mutual funds and Vanguard a couple times.  Before you get into the market, educate yourself!  (And it's not a big leap for me to assume that you aren't, by the way - no stock pro ever trades penny stocks.)  Here are some recommendations:

* Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, especially if you want to change your emotional relationship with money.
* The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, especially if you have high expenses.
* The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke by Suze Orman.
* I Will Teach You to be Rich by Ramit Sethi.
* The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing and/or The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning, both by Larimore et al, which covers the investing philosophy espoused by most of r/personalfinance.
* A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, especially if you aren't convinced that index-investing is right for you.
* The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein
* Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, especially if you are in more debt than you want to be.
* The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason, for timeless advice.

If you only read one from that list, by the way, make it ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street.""  Trust me, it's worth your while.

**TL;DR - Don't go into stock investing chasing ridiculous gains.  Consider setting up a retirement account.  Put money into indexed mutual funds, not single stocks.  If you buy single stocks, consider that money written off.  And, for the love of god, NO PENNY STOCKS.**

"I have lost 40% of investment in stock market, how is it possible to recover?","Ah yes, the buy high panic sell low strategy, never disappoints.

Hyperinflation,"Unbeknownst to many, there is in fact an actual definition of the word ['hyperinflation'](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp). Which is a 50% increase in the price level per month. While what the US is seeing remains under 7% for the year, while the multi year trend has been barely any inflation at all. Moreover, pretty much everyone in economics is seeing the current inflation as mainly supply disruptions. And not a lasting trend. [The bond markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/citi-s-bailin-says-bond-market-shows-inflation-is-transitory), which is the private sector entity with the most skin in the game concerning long  term or spiking inflation, is not pricing in any significant inflation expectations. 

Basically, people in the crypto markets don't understand economic fundamentals. And what they say is not a good indication of what is expected."

"If trading is such a potential “gold mine”, why doesn’t everyone do it?","The sunk cost requirements in time, knowledge and startup capital.

Then when you start putting money you're going to have to accept losses as you go forward and gain experience, managing the anxiety and stress that comes with trading.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 14/Jun/2017,"I'm baffled right now. This doesn't feel like real life. I'm seeing people complaining about a dip, and looking for answers to why the price is going down.

&amp;nbsp;

Has everyone gone nuts? Or is everyone commenting new people/trolls? Because if I recall correctly, **we hit $300 just 4 DAYS ago** Even this ""dip"" at its lowest is +45% from last week. Non-crypto investments are lucky if they see that much increase in a YEAR.

I remember people discussing price in terms of ""I wonder if we'll hit $200 by the end of the year""...that was a month ago. A month ago, we were at around $80, and now people are complaining about being at $360. I think ETH gains just have everyone spoiled a this point."

"32, Black Woman, Single Mom, Raised in Hood, Drug Addicted &amp; Absentee Parents, Once Was Homeless &amp; Preggo Just Crossed 100K Net Worth Living in NY","Now *this* is a story I love to see more on this subreddit.  

&amp;nbsp;

One of the beauties of this story is that it is relatable to me.  As a Hispanic male born into homelessness in East LA in the 80s, the odds of success is incredibly steep.  Social, economical, and educational struggles can easily derail the success of upcoming potentials.  Us folks start in a position that is beyond the ""last place of the race"" expecting to become a statistic, a blip story in the morning news, a faceless number in a sea of struggle, poverty, and depression.  

&amp;nbsp;

The journey to get out of that evil bubble of poverty is fucking hard.  I can't stress how difficult it is to folks who never experience it.  Everything that is around you eventually becomes a challenge in one form or another even if intentions are not malice.  Parents struggle from financial and health decisions (sometimes they are not given a choice).  Friends veer off due to drugs, teenage pregnancy, blowing off education.  Education takes a backseat.


&amp;nbsp;

And even if one manages to get be successful, it can be very, *very* lonely.  There's not many people out there that we can relate to.  Yes, there are stories of success from underrepresented minorities who grew up in a drug-ridden, poverty stricken, dangerous environment.  But for folks who pursue FIRE on top of that?  That is almost unheard of.

Why need to stand up to Bittrex. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE UPVOTE. Help 1000s of people. Missing 1000s of dollars.

If they have 100,000’s of users hitting their site consistently then they might be finding themselves in a place where their cost to manage the system could have been outpacing the amount of money they collect in fees (which I assume is their primary source of income).

A few companies I have worked for have faced similar hurdles and frankly with the explosion of people exploring crypto I am not surprised. Once and if they figure out a route to scale and get some partnerships in place to help their flow of money then you will be able to start talking about support.

I will make a shot in the dark and say that they might be tech heavy on their internal team and not as many people helping with support and operations. It is what haunted my current company (a startup tech company) for two years and the same thing that kills many startup companies.

Hacked on bittrex for 100k. Need to know what happened,"these are API calls. Most likely you logged onto a spoofed phishing site, and it sent api calls to the real site to get valid account balance info/etc so it would look normal to you. As soon as you logged off, it sold your shit and sent it to that great wallet in the sky. 

The momentary delay during your initial login was them creating the API keys that would later be used to transfer their loot out of the system.

    NEW IP LOGIN 
    
    UNKNOWN_IP_WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS 
    
    NEW_IP WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS

so now, you need to figure out what link you clicked on to be directed to the fake site. Was it a link in an email? If you went to the ""real site"" (via a bookmark or by typing the address in the address bar) but were phished anyway then most likely your computer is owned and you have an entry in your hosts file that redirects bittrex.com to a fake IP address that hosts an identical site.

Start a command prompt as administrator and issue the following command 

    ""notepad.exe C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts""

on a normal system, it should look like this: http://imgur.com/a/VYsXQ

If it has an entry for bittrex, you are hacked. It will look like this http://imgur.com/a/bcRa6 this is what it would look like if they redirected bittrex to another IP address on your computer, since windows checks this file first before querying DNS (Domain Name System) for the IP Address of bittrex.com. 

If it has some random IP address in there, this is the place that stole your money. You can trace the IP Address owner and submit a report to police/interpol/justice league/the guy who owns the ip address. Most likely it will be some internet cafe in Shanghai or India and that's where the trail will go cold.

if the hosts file looks normal, open regedit.exe and check the registry key at: 

    \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath 
    
^^^ this is where windows host file location is specified and this is where windows will look for the host file it uses to resolve names (www.bittrex.com) to addresses (104.17.156.108 &lt;- their actual ip) for your browser to actually connect to.

it should look like this http://imgur.com/a/Ius1v if it isnt identical to the example I provided, you are hacked

if it doesn't point to ""%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc"" then they have created a fake hosts file somewhere else on your system (the new path specified in the registry key), and this is truly some next level hacking shit, because your adversary is employing stealth to mask their activities. 

Another easy way to tell is to compare the results of a ping command (which uses hosts + dns) to the results from nslookup (which uses only DNS). If there is a mismatch (ping is hitting a server not listed in the results of nslookup) then this is a huge red flag. Example: http://i.imgur.com/FRZ1dOt.png 

here is an example of what it would look like if bittrex.com is redirected to 123.123.123.123 in the hosts file: http://imgur.com/a/ZPAtc
hosts file: http://imgur.com/a/uFJiA



If this is the case you will want to take the system down to bare metal, blow away the OS, flash the motherboard, flash any firmware you can with known good copies, etc *before you use it for anything else.*

Also if your computer is owned, 

**don't forget to change every single password in every website (from a known good computer) starting with your bank, and then credit cards, lastpass (if you use it), or any other sites where you feel that they might liberate your hard earned cash from you all the way down to facebook and twitter etc. Matter of fact, do that anyways, like now.**

you might ask for help in /r/netsec or /r/computerforensics (hint they will be more inclined to help if there is a small fee). even if your coin is  not recovered at least you will have some idea who to shake your fist at. 

when you logged in and there was a long delay, did you get a 2fa prompt? or did you submit your 2fa with the login that took a long time?

A Gentle Reminder about Life,"For sure- I found out 2 weeks ago my neighbor pal has early onset dementia at 58, just tragic.

Why is the financial sector able to maintain such high wages and profits compared to other professional services sectors? Why doesn’t this attract more competition that results in wages and profit margins being forced down?,"For the investing industry, there is actually a fair amount of competition. The average hedge fund [only lasts for five years](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/07/31/1913792/most-hedge-funds-fail/), while [the average mutual fund fares marginally better at 8.6.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/can-mutual-fund-get-better-age/) The comparison of compensation scheme to structural engineers is rather unfair: a construction company is done once the building is complete, while a hedge fund continues to actively manage your money the entire time you keep it with them, so charging a percentage of the total assets every year is much more warranted. However, you're right that the infamous 2 and 20 is exorbitant. The good news is that competition is working! [Fees are declining, with only 30% insisting on the traditional 2 and 20.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/only-a-third-of-hedge-funds-charge-2-and-20-fees-says-expert-1541851200) More generally, thanks to competition from low cost index funds, [money is drastically flowing away from actively managed funds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/outflows-inflows-active-passive-stock-funds-51571439212), and some of their largest clients like the [California pension system](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pensions-calpers-hedgefunds/calpers-dumps-hedge-funds-citing-cost-to-pull-4-billion-stake-idUSKBN0HA2D120140916) have sworn off hedge funds. It took a while, but over time, the sheen of active management and their (usually unfulfilled) promises of outperforming the market has worn off, and they're being competed away by lower cost alternatives.

As for investment banking, the relevant competitive angle is relationships with the CFOs and CEOs at potential client companies. Large firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley provide enough continuity that new entrants into the investment banking industry can develop those relationships as they rise up the ranks, so that by the time they become managing directors they are already chummy with their decision making counterparts. And indeed, most of a managing director's time is spent not doing market research or detailed quantitative analysis but instead [cultivating their relationships with clients](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-career-path/) so that when a CFO is contemplating a capital raise or M&amp;A transaction, the name they know and trust is yours. The idea that competition is based not around price or competence but rather networking may be gauche, but for better or worse it's how the industry works. And because those relationships are very scarce, the people who have them are able to extract large rents.

All that said, there *is* competition in the investment banking industry, and even new entrants! Most new entrants are what's called [""boutique investment banks.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique_investment_bank) Such banks are usually founded by a former managing director at a large who has decided that he can leverage his relationships without the corporate name to help him; for example, [Qatalyst, one of the most prominent investment banks for the tech industry, was founded by Frank Quattrone, who was a former star managing director at Morgan Stanley's tech investment banking group in Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quattrone). However, you'll still see the established names like Goldman or Morgan on any deals that a boutique bank facilitates. That's because investment banking often requires a large balance sheet to help finance transactions. While a top managing director can take his relationships with him when he starts his boutique firm, he can't take the balance sheet as well. So rather than try to accumulate enough capital to run an entire deal in house, most boutiques will instead partner with the larger and older firms, where the boutique is providing most of the strategic direction and advice but the older firm is making their balance sheet available for a smaller cut of the fees.

**TLDR: Hedge funds actually *are* being competed away. For investment banks, the relevant dimension is their relationships with CFOs and CEOs, which cannot be competed away except by new firms founded by industry veterans.**"

Is there a better sub where comments aren’t hidden 99.9% of the time?,"I think there is a trade-off on Reddit between high quality content and ease of posting. 

This sub has some of the highest quality responses that I have seen on Reddit, but it comes at the cost of heavy moderation and a long approval process to get comments visible. Generally I save posts from this sub that I am interested in and come back to them later once comments have been approved, but I can see how not everyone will go this far. 

If this is not done already, it might be beneficial to flair individuals who have made *at least one* quality contribution in the past and allow their submissions to be automatically approved. This lowers the threshold for post approval, but also gives a mechanism of removing the flair and auto-approval for posters who give subsequent low quality answers."

"Wikipedia has a section arguing that supply and demand isn't real, or no longer applies. Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?","Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe. It also tends to misrepresent orthodox economics and be weirdly out of touch with modern economics (note how most of the people the article cites are heterodox economists, economists from the 1970's or earlier and no modern, mainstream economist is cited). Anyways, in order:

1. No, economic theory makes very sharp predictions about how we think markets will react to exogenous shocks (prices rise when a hurricane destroys crops is a testable prediction). And yes, we can measure supply and demand curves.

2. No, supply and demand still apply to modern goods (again see the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/qflpw6/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory/) for empirical validation of core microeconomic theory). The administrative prices argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable firms survive)"

The person on the phone would say something like ""hmm this is interesting, let me go talk to a specialist and put you on hold."" Then they hung up. The only reason I got my eth in the end was because one of my comments on /r/Coinbase got Justin from Coinbase (forgot his username) attention.

How do people on Reddit have so much money to invest?,"Started with nothing, worked flipping burgers, served in the Army, finished college, worked up to mid level management, started investing in stock funds early... compounding is real.  Then boom.  Lots of $s to invest.  Not get rich quick.  But $3M net worth in my 50s and investing to multiply.  Anyone can do it."
Compound Interest,"There is no explicit compounding for shares unless you reinvest the dividends. Compounding is defined as generating an income on the income you receive. If there is no income (no yield) then there is no compounding.

Why do folks believe the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the cause of high fuel in the US. The data shows it went up way before.,"Because people want a simple answer for a complex problem. Blaming Putin is the simple answer.

Now as to what is really going on, in 2020 we had a global pandemic that caused a drop in the demand for oil. In response to a massive drop in demand the oil industry laid of massive number of people and idled a large number of wells. This caused a rise in the price of oil products in 2021.

In 2021 Russia started to build up troops on the Ukraine border, it was obvious to everyone that they were going to invade. This along with the drop in oil and refining production caused the large rise in oil prices in 2021. 

In 2022 Russia invades Ukraine and you can see the price of oil spike again. What is also happening though is the oil industry, like every other industry, is having a labor and supply chain problem. The labor that they laid off in 2020 and 2021 is not returning in 2022. In addition it takes equipment and material to restart idle wells and that equipment and material is in short supply because of supply chain problems.

Now then in addition Russian exports have received sanctions making them unavailable to sell in the countries that are issuing the sanctions. In response Russia has cut off oil and gas delivery to a number of European countries. Also the Nord Stream II pipeline that was expect to enter service delivering natural gas to Europe has not been started. 

Is it partially Putin's fault, yes, is partially because we are still in a pandemic and supply chains are still messed up, yes. Is it easy and politically expedient to blame it all on Biden or Putin, yes. Do people want to blame someone for a complex problem that has no solution, yes."
Is Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan Regressive?,"The argument is about people who *after* finishing college will be well enough off that financial assistance becomes questionable.

Finishing college comes with a huge earnings premium. The average college graduate earns roughly *double* in their lifetime compared to the average highschool graduate.

https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/

https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/2012-economic-commentaries/ec-201210-the-college-wage-premium.aspx

So, people who attend college are on average much better off than those who don't. And of course people who don't attend college don't have student loans and therefore don't benefit from student loan forgiveness. Because of that, it's seen as a handout to at least the rich*er* part of the population.

Of course that doesn't mean you can't make an argument for student loan forgiveness for the part of the population who have student loan debt and don't earn substantially more than highschool grads.

Also, there are at least some caps. People with incomes above 125k don't benefit. But then, that's still over 3x as much as the median personal income. Handing $10000 to someone who earns 100k a year is still regressive. Not to mention that it's an argument about *future* earnings as well. Maybe you're still in College, earning like 10k a year at some shitty sidegig, but if you *will* earn 100k+ a few years down the line, handing you student loan forgiveness is still regressive.

&gt;If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?

Because it's mostly politics and arguments tend to be rather dumb.

Blanket student loan forgiveness is regressive. That doesn't mean that nobody is struggling or that you can't make an argument for those who could actually benefit from some help. But ultimately these discussions tend to be either slapfights or circlejerks, people aren't discussing the nuances of for which people it does and doesn't make sense."
Former investment bank FX trader: some thoughts,"This is awesome, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.. I will definitely read every post, and it would be terrific if you would consider having a full PDF downloadable link for a printable hardcopy version because you sum up and get to the facts so well 😉👍 Including a risk calculator!"
I have started earning 18 LPA in hand salary. How should I invest?,"Step 1: Emergency Fund: Before doing anything else, start with 6-12 months of expenses (50k x 12) and stash it away in an absolutely liquid investment - liquid meaning one that is near instantly convertible into cash - something like an FD. One additional point - this has to be separated from your regular savings account, so that you are not tempted to spend it unless it is a true emergency. 

The idea of the emergency fund is to give you freedom. Let’s say your job turns crappy and you want to leave. If you are dependent on the salary, you can’t just up and leave. But if you have 12 months stashed away, you know you can take the time to breathe and search for a job that you truly like. Next, think of the power it gives you in a salary negotiation. You walk in not needing the job that instant. You are not stressed about your expenses and relying on whatever the HR of the new company throws at you. Instead, you have the ultimate power to walk away from the negotiation if you have to. Finally, it benefits you in case, god forbid, you lose your job for whatever reason. 

The emergency fund is the last you draw from and first you refill. Remember, if you ever draw your emergency fund down, your first priority is to fill it back up.

Step 2: now that you have an emergency fund, you can start to think of investments. First up, tax saving ones - Section 80C. Google this to know more but my suggestion here is ELSS. Maximize the annual limit of 1.5 lakh in one or more ELSS schemes to claim this tax benefit. 

Step 3: Now, you are getting close to investing, but you aren’t there yet. Think of massive unexpected expenses that you cannot cover out of pocket and insure against them - health insurance, life insurance, term life insurance etc. Health insurance is a must, but the others depend on your needs, and the needs of your dependents if any. 

Step 4: we made it to investing land! Do you fancy losing half your money tomorrow and taking 7 years to get back to the original principal while losing value to inflation? If your answer is no, and it should be, then you should diversify. Again, you are young, so you can afford to take more risk, but it should still be diversified. The exact allocation is up to you, but consider equities (stocks), bonds (corporate, government), commodities, precious metals, real estate etc. Remember to save fees wherever possible, 1% fee compounded over decades will destroy returns - ex: choose direct mutual funds instead of regular. The investments in this step are long-term, long-term meaning until retirement or next milestone (marriage - please invite only 50 people and get married on the cheap - no one cares these days and if they do, that’s on them; house, whatever other expense but at least a decade time horizon).

You check on Step 4 investments annually and adjust (rebalance) to bring the allocation back to your target allocation + change the target allocation itself to go more conservative as you age.

Step 5: Some fun money! This is the fun part. What’s the new thing? Solano? NFTs? DeFi? Options trading? Something else? 

This category is to satisfy your craving to be in on the action. Remember that you have stashed away a majority of your money towards long-term goals in Step 4. So this is the small amount that’s left that you are willing to lose in its entirety but also willing to take the risk to see if it pans out. 

Step 5 isn’t just a gimmick. Psychologically, having a small amount of your portfolio to play with for high-risk active investing makes you far less likely to touch the rest of your portfolio than if you had none at all. If you have zero allocated to this category, you become tempted to gamble (yes, most of those, regardless of what anyone says, are risky gambles) with your large savings.

That’s it my friend. Most of this stuff is on autopilot, you get to have your fun on the weekends, focus on your life and career and not worry everyday because you have a plan and you are sticking to it. 

Good luck to the both of us! I am 2 years older than you are 😅"
What is the expected economic impact of Santa's global distribution of toys made with magic and free elf labor?,"Santa drives the price of toys and manufacturing labor down each Christmas. So the supply curve shifts right. Christmas however temporarily increases demand, so there are higher goods supplied at the same price point.

Since Christmas has been going on for years predictably the market expects it and corrects itself in small increments, so there are no large changes to the market.

After Christmas demand for toys goes down, and the labor supply from the elves will not be seen till the next year. This is a bit hard to track how much they are paid because it appears Santa collects payment in milk andcookies. We need more research and need to index cookie prices. Further we would need to take into account store bought vs home made, the amount of cookies supplied per household, and type of cookie."

"[UPDATE] I found out that a coworker in the same position, with the same education, experience, workload, etc. is making almost twice what I make","You just found out the reason that employers don't want employees discussing wages, and tell employees it's illegal or that they'll get fired.

Megathread: 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson,"Why auctions? If you find it odd that auctions could be so important, think of auctions as devices used to allocate resources or goods and services. 

A well designed auction will result in a price and quantity where the good/service is provided by the sellers with the lower cost and/or bought by the buyers with the highest valuation, and both sides are satisfied with the outcome.

This is relevant because, even in the absence of competitive markets, it's possible to find an efficient price and quantity. It could also reduce the incentives to collude. 

That's one of the reasons auction theory is so important for other economic theory but also for real world applications. And I don't mean only for cattle or ebay auctions, a famous example is the UK electric power auction. There's a lot more to it, but you could find more details and more examples in the linked articles in the OP."

Truth about successful algo traders. They dont exist,"I see so many introduce themselves here as engineers, computer scientists, etc. and wanting to get into algo trading but IMO that’s like someone saying they want to become a restaurant owner because they eat lunch everyday. 

The code for my algos is so simple a 12 year old can program it. But the logic behind what to code takes an understanding of the markets you won’t have until you’re 1000+ hours in. If you’re a developer who wants to build the infrastructure, that’s fine, but it’s either a hobby or a SaaS business - unless you’re investing 12+ hours a day looking at charts and learning about markets I think your success rate with actual algo trading will be very low.

The reason why so many discretionary and algo traders fail isn’t because it’s rocket science but because the barrier to entry is so low.

Death Claim process experience after losing my parents,"I am so sorry for your loss. 
Faced something similar with banks specifically when I lost my mother to covid last year. I can relate how red tapeism and the sheer amount of followups you have to do hampers the emotional grieving part.

Learning from the experience has been the following -
1. Make request for closure of account in writing or over mail, make sure to drop death certificate copies via speed post or registered post to the branch you are dealing with

2. RBI has a mandate to have the closure of accounts in case of death of primary holder and disbursement of claims. Reach out to the bank's redressal officer's mail address in case nothing happens within two weeks of request.

3. After two weeks of intimating the grievance officer, you are free to reach out to banking ombudsman. This is what would actually move their asses and make them work on having everything sorted asap.

I was myself asked for affidavits from remaining heirs, NOCs and what not but I pulled a document from bank's own website claiming that in case of joint account which is in nature of either or survivor, there is no need of all this and it is actually punishable if the officials harass for such documents.

Filed an rti using that doc and lo and behold, the branch manager called me the next day and asked me how would I want the funds out - Cheque or bank transfer and came home personally to hand over the cheque and how to explain that they did everything they could to get it sorted in time."

Happy to let WSB bros blow up margin accounts to -50k and go bankrupt in risky triple-leveraged option plays for the past 3 years, but suddenly when those same WSB bros are making 2.5mil simply buying stock, now suddenly it's too risky and ""we gotta look out for the little guy"".

Is there a legitimate bull case for Gamestop (GME)?,"GameStop is a thesis. It is a hypothesis that financial players on wallstreet have been committing crimes for decades and in doing so they are robbing the general public. A certain individual on reddit noticed that this stock had more shares shorted than were ever issued. A following was started. In January of 2021, the thesis was all but ""proved"" when we saw the price squeeze from a few dollars to over 500$ in less than a couple of days. The thesis was all but proved!! Since that time, there is enough evidence to show that the amount of shares sold short are even greater than last January. The new thesis since that time is that crimes were committed by shutting off the buying of this stock but the financial powers that be, rather than taking their loss, decided to double down. Increasing their short position and opening themselves up to an infinite loss of money. 

You friend is playing the odds. He is not looking at this as an investment based on earnings, PE ratios, etc...He is looking at it as once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of an infinite gain of money. January 2021 cannot be denied. It happened and we all saw the industry shut retail out from unimaginable gains. THey didnt do this because they were sour. They did it because if they hadn't they would have incurred infinite losses. We already know this to be true. Major Wallstreet execs have admitted to this. We were there as it happened. 

In the end, any individual NOT holding GME is making the mistake. There has never been a greater opportunity to be a part of an infinite money glitch than there is now. Everyone holding GME is aware that this may not play out exactly as they want. They are all prepared to lose. If your friend made as much money as I did back in Jan...then he is playing with house money so it's even better. 

One thing is for sure...if you think we are all nuts. Fine! Bt it doesnt matter because as an investment...Gamestop is one of the most promising companies out there."

Are we overstretching ourselves with a house purchase?,"Let's run some numbers to validate whether you better off keeping your money in index funds, or taking a mortgage with a lower LTV.

If you take a 90% LTV mortgage:

* You need £55k deposit and a £495k mortgage
* According to MSE's best buy comparison, the best rate available from a mainstream lender for this mortgage is 2.5%
* That means you would be paying **£12,375 a year in interest**

If you take a 85% LTV mortgage:

* You need a £82.5k deposit and £467.5k mortgage
* According to MSE's best buy comparison, the best rate available from a mainstream lender for this mortgage is 2.14%
* That means you would be paying **£10,004 a year in interest**

The difference between the deposits is £27.5k, and the difference in interest is £2,371 per year.

£2,371 on £27,500 is 8.6%.

Therefore, by selling your ISAs to get a 15% mortgage, **you are getting a guaranteed return of 8.6%** on the additional money you are putting into your house deposit. Remember that lowering the LTV brings the cost of the entire mortgage down - not just the cost of the additional deposit.

This return is **guaranteed, risk free** and is **higher than the long term average** of 7-8% that has historically been generated by the global stock markets.

I conclude that you will be better off selling down more of your ISAs and increasing your house deposit to at least 85% LTV - when compared with taking a 90% LTV mortgage and keeping your ISAs.

Personally I would put money into the house until you get down to 80% LTV. After that, you start getting competitive mortgage rates and the returns diminish, so that's the time to focus on your S&amp;S ISA again.

"Lost 500k recently and now trying to recover slowly, need some advice.","Hey man. I've seen you posting around various threads looking for help. That's a lot of money to lose and I understand you're struggling to cope with it.

The real advice I see you're asking for is ""how do I make this money back the fastest?""

This is called chasing your losses. It's a symptom of a gambling addiction and is an emotional impediment that makes you a danger to yourself when trading.

Others have already recommended taking time off and paper trading, but I think you are too eager to see some immediate upside to take that advice.

So here is my recommendation: move into common shares for awhile. 

You're currently gambling with options, and are now asking whether you should buy LEAPS on a company that's up 150% since they direct listed in September at $10. 

I understand you want to leverage your remaining capital as much as possible, but over leveraging yourself in calls is what caused the loss in the first place.

If you believe PLTR will go up (which is why you are considering buying long dated ATM Call options) then buy shares in increments of 100. From there sell Covered Calls. Yes you limit your upside, but this the kind of risk management you need right now.

This gives you time to watch and learn from the stock. You'll be able to predict it's movements better over time. This allows you to trade on it and not simply ""bet it all on red"".

Good luck man, and remember: there are millions of once in a lifetime opportunities in the markets every day."

Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,"I had something similar happen with my ICICI bank debit card years back.

Former investment bank FX trader: some thoughts,"Good post overall.

Cant disagree more with the idea of splitting the amounts you risk depending on your 'conviction' on any given trade though. The market doesnt give a rats about that.

If you have a particular setup you are willing to risk a ridiculous amount on (ie 5%), then you should only be trading that setup and not the others.

If an ideology I see floating around the subreddit way too much and it just boils down to traders thinking they know wtf the market is upto. You dont, dont pretend you do, risk your 1% or lower and take the best entries you can. Not 3 different ones where you risk different amounts per entry.

Our job here is to control risk. I dont see why someone would open themselves upto potentially winning 3 x 1% trades and losing 1 x 5% trade to wipe out all their gains because they have more 'conviction' on 1 relative to the other 3. I mean you can argue that and say that you lose 3 x 1% and win the 1 x 5%, but again... our job is to manage risk, not hope for wins.

The concept, and why its popular, boggles the mind tbh."

What do economists know now that they didn't 50 years ago?,"Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability to expand knowledge of industrial methods.

Another major growth area has been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged in the last 30 or so years.

Finally, changes to the structure of the global economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s, has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency. Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.). For the most part though, computation may arguably one of the biggest contributors to facilitating modern advancements as far as I'm aware."

What’s a financial decision you’ve watched someone make that made you scream inside?,"I’ve got a couple

My Mother in Law (MIL):

* has two $1million dollar properties, with interest only loans. Never paid principle on each $500k loan, and is now retired. She has apparently spent all her super as well. 

* Chooses not to rent out either property because she likes to be able to impulsively go on holidays. If she had rented one of them she would have completely paid off the mortgage

* Spends all her money on fad diets, premium furniture, and fun gadgets. Does not have a working oven at either house because she apparently doesn’t have money

* Blew up at us because she wants us to buy her a waterfront 3 bed house in Cronulla. No joke. Not sure why she thinks we are that loaded because we are most certainly not.

My friends bf:

* Went on the dole because he “morally disagrees” with working

* Received a $30K inheritance and blew it on a holiday

* Attempted to not pay rent because he “morally disagrees” with paying for shelter. Was almost evicted 

* Lost his license for not paying numerous road tolls because he “morally disagrees” with paying to use the road

* Bonus story: he spends all his time “philosophising” and developing his philosophy. It’s about how greed, vanity, and money are the cause of all evil, and take us away from connecting with people. Apparently he used to have money and gambled it away, so therefore all money tempts us. Hilariously, if he was to tell others about this theory, it would bring attention and money to him, so he can’t tell people because it will corrupt him. Also he got kicked out of a course to be a counsellor because he “morally disagreed” with being assessed and also because he wanted to indoctrinate his clients into his theory

My dads stepbrother:
* My dads mother remarried to a multimillionaire. Dads step siblings apparently each get $250-500k per year from a family trust. 

* One of his step siblings consistently blows 100% of that money on drugs

A friends father also has apparently spent over 10 years and over $1million of family money on building a packing machine that does not work"

Well said my man or woman.

No regaling with tales of poor childhood or struggles. I think at this point this is a common denominator for the majority in on the movement.

The 1% truly do not understand the movement. They are using the same old tactics and are convinced we will be scared. The more they say I am stupid, and the more they say I will not win, only gives me more resolve. I have been told that I will fail more times than I can count.

Alot of us have watched for decades and felt cheated, deceived, or outright manipulated. Whether that is via stocks, pay structure in jobs, exclusivity, does not matter.

There is and has been a ruling class whose sole purpose is to retain power. They gaslight us into thinking they know what is best for us. 1% knows better than 99%.

This is not stocks, this is a financial revolution never seen before. And let's be honest, the outcome will be a governing revolution.

I yolo'd $54k yesterday, and set a buy order for another $12k **(Look at my history)**. I am not a money man, I lost my job in February last year and used my severance and took a risk.

Thanks to my military service and entering the market in the middle of the COVID shit I am fortunate enough to be in my last semester for a Chemistry degree.

I don't want to live the life of Wallstreet. I just want to live my life. My kids will learn the value of hard work and honesty; hopefully, with less pitfalls than I have experienced.

Prior to this I invested for personal gain. This YOLO money I am truly willing to lose in pursuit of changing the system. I will hold beyond the peak, not because I am stupid, but because I know we have a better chance of breaking the system if we force the shorts to cover everything. Every last fucking cent.

"Crazy 1bed aprt. inspection, rental market in Sydney.","Haymarket is the heart of Chinatown, for Chinese people looking for places via Mandarin apps, they will see places in this area, the buildings are nice but there aren't that many.

Where has all the money in the world gone?,"Here's some way of thinking about it, and I'm not really sure if it's completely correct, but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old :)

Say there are two people in the world. You and me. We both have $100. A total of $200 in the world.

Suddenly, a wild bank appears. I deposit my $100 in the bank. I still have $100 and you still have $100. Now you want to buy something from me that costs $150. You go to the bank to loan money. The bank has $100 available so gives you $50. You give me $150. Now I have $250 and you are $50 in debt. I deposit the $150 in the bank.

We do this again and again, until I have $1000 on my bank account, and you are $900 in debt. I want to buy a house of $500 and go to my bank, demanding to take out $500. But there is only $200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $200.

""Money"" has been created out of thin air, but it's actually you who are in debt. If you go bankrupt, the bank has a big debt it won't get back, and is in deep shit when I come around to demand my money back. At that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap, because if the bank fails, I will lose all my pension savings I put into that bank, as well as my companies and a lot of my employees.

And other banks loaned this bank money, so if this bank fails, the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail, because then they will also have debts that won't be paid back.

There are regulations minimizing this - i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts, so there's a maximum limit of ""money created"".

All right WTF is going on with GME,"What is going on: there are more shares of GME shorted than actually exist. That means that if the stock goes up for *any* reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it’s a race to buy shares, but there simply aren’t enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a “short squeeze”. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it’s very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It’s a matter of *when* they start to crack, not *if*. By all accounts they haven’t cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn’t actually started.

What happened Friday was a “gamma squeeze”, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.

The high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even *more* likely.

If you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you’re ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive. Everybody knows this is going down, it’s been covered on major news, and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack.

Edit: either pony up for gold so I don’t have to look at ads or save your money for GME shares Monday morning"
$26 Should Be The Minimum Wage According to MIT (read),"Limited housing supply is a huge driver of cost of living, especially in HCOL areas. More wages cannot fix this problem because housing is a fixed supply and rents will just rise to cancel out the higher wages.

Where I live in California, they have been making some changes such as relaxing zoning requirements, but the response has been sluggish at best. We really need more aggressive programs to support faster building."

"You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1","The need to “Win more” (greed) is a weird quirk of humanity. I didn’t buy into BTC until 28k. I passed on every opportunity when it was $1, $5, $100, etc... because I didn’t really understand what was happening. I was around when 4chan users were tipping each other in BTC. I sold my BTC at $50k. I could’ve bought in sooner and I could’ve held longer, but I DOUBLED MY INVESTMENT in a very short period of time. That’s the DREAM in most investments.

Think about a traditional investment. If you make 20% in a year on a stock, that’s a really amazing stock. Take your profits and move on. Don’t agonize over how much you could’ve made with a different decision.

I think it’s because with cryptos, people are investing very small amounts. $50-$100 at a time and expecting $1000 or more in profit. If you put in $100 and get $120 out, you’ve done VERY well compared to almost anything else."

Do scandinavian countries free-ride on innovation from the US?,"They do free ride off American innovation, but so does basically every other country. America is the #1 innovator in absolute terms because it is the largest developed country.

In per capita terms however, my personal view is that the Nordic countries *probably* are less innovative, but that this isn't necessarily due to their characteristics (higher taxes and redistribution). Its more that the USA is exceptional in some ways. The USA has a massive economies of scale advantage, being a single market the size of Europe, but far more integrated. Europe being damaged heavily after the two world wars allowed America to take the lead as a global power and establish itself as the global economic hub, the benefit of which is still seen today. As a result, the [USA has venture capital investment that dwarfs any European country](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=VC_INVEST) despite having higher taxes on corporations and capital in some cases (think California having a 44% corporate tax rate before TCJA and a 32% capital gains tax rate, both of which are far higher than nordic rates). Its actually rather common to have companies start up elsewhere but eventually move to California for its established base of talent despite the burden of higher taxes. 

As a result of of these differences between the the nations, I think its somewhat flawed to present a simplistic and broad cross country comparison as evidence that ""cuddly capitalism"" would result in a decrease in innovation, considering that the USA actually has higher taxes on capital in its most innovative regions.

To push back a bit on the technical side of Acemoglu's study though, I think his usage of patents as a proxy for innovation is somewhat flawed because the [USA has recently seen an explosion in the number of patents, but no such increase in total factor productivity](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/49487-Innovation.pdf) (See page 34 specifically), implying that most of these patents likely aren't useful, making the number of patents a bad measure of innovation. As the [voxeu article you linked](https://voxeu.org/article/nordic-innovation-cuddly-capitalism-really-less-innovative) points out, different metrics of innovation do not support the claim that nordic countries are significantly less innovative. Its also worth noting that the [Global Innovation Index](https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator) ranks Sweden (#2) ahead of the USA (#3), but I think the index is mostly garbage, so I wouldn't put much stock into it.

TLDR; USA likely is more innovative, but that it is due to USA's unique characteristics, and I do not think becoming more like the nordic countries would result in a decrease in innovation."

My boss game me a $100 “Christmas bonus” and then took $100 advance out of my next check.,"You should ask your boss. Could just be a payroll mix-up. Employers are required to deduct taxes from any pay, even if it's a cash bonus.

He could have told the finance/payroll person to ""make sure to deduct that $100 from u/LouisSeaGays paycheck next week"". He meant deduct the taxes, they heard deduct the whole amount off your check.

So just call your boss. Say ""hey, I really appreciate the bonus you gave me. I'm a little confused though. Last week I had $100 taken out of my paycheck and it said it was for an advance. Was the $100 you gave me supposed to be a bonus above my normal paycheck or an advance against my future paycheck""?

He'll either say it was a bonus and fix it. Or he'll say it was an advance. In which case you can say something like ""oh, well that's disappointing"" and move on. You're not really going to be able to fight it - but now you know your employer isn't as cool as you thought before and maybe that will factor into whether or not you keep working there long term.

Edit: well, this comment got a lot more attention than anticipated! And thank you kind stranger for the gold!

Also, someone below mentioned it could be a simple payroll error or misreading of the paystub. They may have been paying the bonus in cash, adding an extra $100 to tax it appropriately and then removing the $100 to reconcile. So either way, simple. miscommunication/misunderstanding"

Where has all the money in the world gone?,"To summarize, the money never existed. The best example I can give is the housing bubble. Houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money. When people couldn't make their payments, the house prices crashed.

The boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended (boom) and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes (bust).

The real question that people should be asking is not ""Where did all the money go?"", but ""Why is money issued by private banks?""

Money is a social invention to facilitate trade. Should it not be like a public water utility? Counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it. Money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized. All natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters, joules, degrees, etc. Money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest. We essentially pay rent on all money that isssued and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created, once again at interest. This is why economists generally say some inflation is good. Finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality, money is just an IOU that requires no such interest payment for it's issue.

Interest should be made if a loan is issued against savings, but not for the simple issuance of money. There should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment. You can read more about this from reading about Arthur Kitson. In this way, the public controls the value of it's money, not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class.

If you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt, read the work of Frederick Soddy. It's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least. Wealth is subject to the laws of thermodynamics while debt is an invention of the human will. Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this."

"Since when did a all equity etf/blue chip portfolio become a ""boomer"" portfolio?","The problem is growth vs maintance. When you don't have a lot of capital, growing the capital is primarily the goal. When you have a lot of capital, maintaining it in steady increments is the goal.

If I have 1000$. There isn't much incentive to get that 5% a year increase. Rather I would want to increase it at a higher rate with riskier trades.

However, if I have 50,000$. That 5% a year + dividend off blue chips makes sure that I not only have peace of mind knowing it's secure, but that steady increment is paying off in a big way.

My net-worth is now 5 million dollars. It was 7000 three days ago.,"Typically what people do here is start with a capital allocation plan where they split up their money putting more of it into lower risk investments and smaller sums into higher risk ones.  How much to put in each ""basket"" of risk depends on the individual but usually it'd be something like 300k into a low risk stable longer term return. 100K into a slightly more aggressive mid term sort of investment and then 50K (maybe split over 5\* 10K) high risk sort of investments that can either lose or hit you home runs. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea here is you exposure yourself to a lot of potential upside if things run well for you but limit the amount of downside since most of your money is in lower risk investments.  If you do not have a lot of experience with investing you're going to want to spend a decent amount of time and effort into researching your lower risk/higher capital investments."

United Airlines stock down over 5% premarket trading,"United offers an undifferentiated product in a hyper-competitive market where purchasing behaviour is driven by a) sentiment or b) price. Well, they just booted the cheapest passengers while assaulting one of them. Combine that with a history of bad experiences and I don't see how they're going to fix this one without months of damage control. Or, at the very least, a lot of heads on pikes.

  * **Because he's the perfect victim.** *Elderly* Doctor on the way to tend to his patients is assaulted by jack booted thugs. They went after the one (?) person on that plane who could elicit universal empathy and had a valid, pressing reason to keep his seat.

  * **Because there's blood.** The fact that he was harmed is immediate and visible. There aren't any follow-on reports that need to be tacked on to emphasise the seriousness of the incident. He was an elderly man who had blood dripping from his mouth.

  * **Because he's a part of at least two powerful consumer groups.** Doctors (and nurses) are a powerful lobby, who look out for their own. And are still the most respected profession in the US and the world. Then there's the Chinese/Asian consumers angle.

  * **Because the incident's imagery is almost the perfect set of triggers for mass outrage.** The video had a giant corporation ruining the life of someone vital to American society. Check. It had a literal jack-booted thug. Check. Said thug took something from the person/violated the integrity of their personal space/freedom over a seemingly trivial issue. Triple Check.

A beginner's guide to investing in the stock market (and mutual funds).,"Great read. Thank you.

&gt;Deciding on the goal is crucial, since it allows the investor to think of a proper plan.

Also, having a set goal in mind helps you move out of equity and into safer instruments like bonds well ahead of the goal. 


&gt;Mutual fund investors often have the nagging doubt of whether they have chosen the 'best' mutual fund. For a fund to be the best fund, the fund manager has to do a good job &amp; the market conditions should be good as well. So, the investor has to put their faith in the fund managers and the market. If you find yourself struggling to trust any fund manager to give you consistently good returns, invest in a broad market index fund like Nifty or Sensex.

This is personally why I prefer index funds. The index revolution and the SPIVA reports suggest that over the long term, beating the index return wise is almost impossible. I do not fully subscribe to this idea (at least not yet). I believe that in the current Indian environment there would be funds that could maybe beat the index even over the long term. (This belief in active investing is important even for passive investors, as passive investing only exists cause of active investors). All that being said, I strongly subscribe to the idea that for mutual funds, when comparing ""investor returns"" instead of ""fund returns"", passive investors will outperform active investors. This is because of the point OP mentioned that staying invested in a fund during its bad times is difficult. But the solution is not going the exact opposite route and staying invested in a fund whatever happens. Deciding when to move out of a poorly performing fund is just as hard. This leads to most investors hopping in and out of funds, which leads to reduced investor returns even if the fund themselves had good long term returns.

*************


I would have added one more point to OPs list.

Rebalancing : One of the most crucial elements in investing in stock market. (Unless you're 100 percent in equity).


[rebalance-your-portfolio-stay-on-track](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/rebalance-your-portfolio-stay-on-track/)

One of the biggest advantages to periodic rebalancing is that it takes emotions out of investing while simultaneously helping in profit booking. Have pre set rules that you'll rebalance only once a year or twice a year or if your asset allocation deviates by more than a certain percentage. Or have pre set rules on what to do in case of a market crash (example: rebalance in case of a 20 percent fall in equity. This also ensures you still have money left over for further equity shopping if the market further goes down.)"

The best advice I got when I sold my company, was to not make any big decisions for 6 months.  I ignored that advice...and regretted it.

Evergrande-Gate. Is there a Bear in there? What happens when big kids take over the Sand-Pit?,"G'day cunts, I've been invited to guest lecture on this topic to help wrinkle over some smooth braincells in here. I secretly am a dumb cunt, but have a talent at pretending to be smart so here goes my rundown on what you need to know to impress your mates about what the Evergrande situation means for everyone. I'm basing my rundown on a variety of sources, but huge shout out to [@thelsatbearsta1](https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1) on twitter, this guy is the real genius.

To start with, lets watch [this 11 minute 60 minutes clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie6zd3Rwu4c) on the Ghost Cities of China from 2013. Gigantic residential areas with shopping complexes have been constructed to house millions of people, but with one problem. The people have not come. It is such an absurdity that you need to see it to believe it. The CFA in this video calls it the ""greatest property bubble there has ever been"", but notes that selfishly Australia has fueled this because we keep shipping iron ore to build these monstrosities. ""If the bubble does burst, you simply have to follow the supply chain, which does end up in Australia.""

Now lets look at a second [60 minutes video from 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxjwhk1ktNw) on this topic. Video starts by warning of the greatest housing bubble in human history in China, following the unrelenting development of the ghost cities. Miles, and miles, and miles, of apartments are empty. However, they have all been sold, largely to the emerging middle class of China finally discovering they have extra coin in their pockets. Chinese citizens are not allowed to invest abroad, and their stock market is a rollercoaster meme, so they have turned to property. They have unabashed embraced the ""houses always go up"" meme. Every last penny has been spent buying 5-10 properties per person. Real estate is estimated to be 20-30% of the Chinese economy. Our old CFA mate estimates that 12-24 cities (1m+ people capacity) are built each year. One of the few places where people show up is a ""fake oxford"", where people go to get photos for their wedding. 

At the end of this video, we get short interview from the Founder/Chairman of China's largest real estate company, China Vanke, valued today at $36b USD.  On their balance sheet, they have $162b USD of Inventory. Wang Shi modestly says his company is the greatest real estate developer in the world by quantity, not quality. We get a shocking admission from him in 2013, house prices are too expensive. I'm amazed he's still in the public eye. Maybe he'll get the Jack Ma treatment soon. As of 2013, the average home price cost more than 45x the average citizen's annual salary. And you thought you cunts had it bad in Australia. Wang Shi calls this bubble dangerous, and straight up admits Chinese real estate is a giant bubble. ""If the bubble bursts, it is a disaster"". Wang Shi further elaborates that the excessive debt real estate companies are taking on board are causing housing developments to be abandoned. The ticking time bomb is the social unrest that will develop when the middle class loses their wealth. ""If that bubble broken, who knows what will happen, maybe next Arabic Spring"". Wang Shi is worried that such a fallout would be too big even for the CCP to control. Either way, this is potentially a second Tiananmen Square. A true collapse of the Chinese housing market would mean blood on the streets. 

Now lets have an introduction to Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of the J Capital Hedge Fund specialising in targeting Chinese Equities. She featured in the previous video briefly, but this next section is dedicated to an interview she gave in [August 2017 - Evergrande is the biggest pyramid scheme the world has yet seen.](https://www.fuw.ch/article/china-is-going-to-hit-a-wall/) This article outlines her conviction that the monster bubble in the Chinese housing market is ripe to pop, and that the Chinese currency will crash. It also highlights what a painful bitch it is to be a 🌈🐻, you can be 100% correct in your assessment, and the market will shit over you for the next four years in drunken stupors, before spectacularly collapsing in a hungover heap. Anyway, back to the interview. Essentially, wealth creation for the middle class in China is not driven by salaries, but property price increases. ""That’s the way to drive growth and the way they get people excited and to get them to buy into the idea of the great Chinese miracle."" Property prices are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling within a year, in the most dogshit of locations. Finally, we're focused onto Evergrande. Of the major real estate developers, Evergrande is the one that has leveraged to the tits the most. Of the 40 out of 270 projects Ann has visited, she has only seen one fully occupied. They are spamming ghost cities, because they believe it drives growth. Now I'll highlight one paragraph from the article:

#**So will China’s housing frenzy ever come to an end at all?**

China is going to hit a wall. They’re not positioned to take the political pain that’s entailed by just stopping with all that madness. So there will be a bust but it’s very hard to say exactly how long it takes. Basically, there are two paths. One of them is you break public confidence in some way. **For that to happen you have to have a bank failure, a well-known investment product that doesn’t pay or some property developer that goes bust.** You’ve had that locally in all sorts of places but you have to have a really big bust that everyone is aware of.

Four years later, the prophecy has come true, and I believe Evergrande will miss payments on their $300b debt. They are the big bust. Her final prediction is mass devaluation of the Chinese currency (RMB printing) to escape this mess. Jai Pao will need to step up to the plate.

Now lets dive into the series of twitter threads made in 2021 by [@thelsatbearsta1](https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1). I believe they provide the best rundown, endorsed by one of the few 🌈🐻s out there that outrank /u/atayls, [the self-deleting sperg Michael Burry](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1439831599487623168).

#Key Point 1: Chinese Accounting is bullshit.

Evergrande takes money from the buyers before the properties have been built. Multiple projects are not completed, yet Evergrande simply does not give a fuck, they write the unfinished properties as ""Inventory"" on their balance sheets, yet they are worthless to everyone. They then use the ""strength"" of their balance sheet to borrow even more money, to build more incomplete projects, to borrow more money. Repeat this pyramid scheme until now.  [This is why they have been trying to pay people with unfinished parking lots because that's literally all they have to give.](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210915-china-s-embattled-evergrande-tries-to-pay-bills-with-parking-spots) They are fucking broke, and have ~$300b in debt to pay. 


#Key Point 2: The threat of Contagion cannot be understated

If we accept that Evergrande cannot pay their debts, then it is highly likely that other companies will fall like dominoes. No one knows who is holding the Evergrande bonds, and who is using those bonds as collateral to pay their own debts. 

#Key Point 3: Evergrande has never reported a loss, and has always had more reported assets than liabilities.

"I'm Chris Blattman, economics and political science professor, and I just published *Why We Fight* a book about everything we know about global conflict. AMA!","I have a question about your thoughts on some of your non-conflict-related work.

I've thought a lot about Krugman's old article [In Praise of Cheap Labor](https://slate.com/business/1997/03/in-praise-of-cheap-labor.html), pointing out that, for many, the appalling conditions of sweatshop labor were, at least, an improvement from the alternative. I know you have an RCT in Ethiopia (in one of the AEJ journals, I forget which) that pushed somewhat against this notion.

I also recall seeing a longer-term follow-up with some surprising results (although I can't remember what they were, and I can't seem the find the paper currently).

My question is: Given what you've seen in both the short-run and long-run results of this RCT, do you think that ""sweatshops"" (for lack of a better term) are a ""necessary evil"" along the path of development? Or do you think that better insurance against idiosyncratic shocks can effectively fill the role that sweatshops play as ""labor of last resort""?"

The fact that his tweets move the markers like this is ridiculous, all while being an underinformed, pompous prick. Oh, you realized that Bitcoin uses energy, huh Elon? After you put 1.5 Billion in it? After you declare how awesome it is and how you're accepting it for your cars?  ... What are you, a fucking moron?

The only explanation where he's not a complete idiot is that he's deliberately using this crap, i.e. lying, to manipulate the markets. This would only apply here though if he plans to buy *more* BTC, so keep that in mind."
"$O, Bad Long Term Stock?","The short answer to your concerns is that the majority of your numbers are technically correct, while also simultaneously incorrect.

The first thing you have to realize about Realty Income is that it is not a normal company.  For normal US based corporations, what you have mentioned would be cause for concern.  However, Realty Income is actually a special kind of corporation known as a REIT, or Real Estate Investment Trust.  REITs are corporations that are exempt from most federal taxes, and in exchange are legally required to pass on over 90% of their Net Income under GAAP on to shareholders in the form of dividends.  Key word being ""Under GAAP.""

GAAP (or Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles) are the financial reporting standards required by US law.  They are strict, based in math, and very difficult to fabricate.  Unfortunately, when you are dealing with Real Estate, the mathematics of GAAP begin to break down.  This is due to a variety of reasons, but the short version is that taxes, depreciation, and amortization are required to be deducted from any number the corporation calls ""profit"" (Net Income, as GAAP calls it).  However, Real Estate remember, is for the most part an asset that increases in value.  Especially commercial real estate.

I could honestly break Reddit's character limit on the complexities of Real Estate under GAAP (Whole Graduate level college courses have been taught on the subject) so I won't get into the weeds here, but the important part is that REITs have countered this issue by developing their own metric known as Funds From Operations (FFO).  It is, in all honesty, a more realistic, accurate measurement of what a REIT is actually earning, as they do not worry about depreciation, amortization, or most taxes.  This is why legitimate stock tracking websites like Seeking Alpha will list FFO statistics under the Income Statements of REITS.  [Here](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O/income-statement) is Realty Income's Financial Statements.  If you replace their measure of profit with the FFO, all of a sudden, Realty Income begins to look like a normal investment.  FFO per share over the last 12 months is $3.24.  So as of my writing this, Realty Income's P/FFO ratio is 21.11, which is actually pretty good for this reliable of a dividend payer.  Their FFO payout ratio is between 80-90%, which is exactly where management wants it to be, as that is pretty normal for a REIT.  

When it comes to growth, Real Estate companies rarely use cash to outright buy properties, as such a process is inefficient, as federal law requires them to pass on 90% of profits to shareholders.  So they must raise capital through either the issuance of shares, corporate bonds, or adding other forms of debt to their balance sheet.  A REIT stockpiling too much cash is seen as a bad thing, since they have access to cheaper forms of capital than you or I.  Exemption from most taxation means they can offer better rental rates to corporate clients, and as such are more likely to secure tenants, making them a safer investment for banks and other financial institutions.  The guaranteed dividends if profitable also make them an attractive investment to those seeking stable returns in uncertain markets."
"Roaring Kitty, CFA","I think everyone stands to benefit from watching his step-by-step ""this is how I do DD"" and how he invites discussion around his theses. He checks off all my boxes:

1. Financial statements over the course of several years

1b) I also like that he said ""I can probably call it just on the balance sheet alone"" because that's often been my feeling too, to me, if you're too lazy or uninterested in doing anything, please please please at least look at the balance sheet

2) Spreadsheets and ratios and projections

3) Ownership structure

4) Insider transactions

5) Business prospects/overall market

Well there's a step-by-step video series by Roaring Kitty on how to do good, solid DD without getting into any unnecessary portfolio management theory for business school types who, at the end of the day, make more money selling their company's investment vehicles instead of making money doing any kind of investing.

How did Elon Musk become the wealthiest person in the world?,"The vast majority of Elon Musk's net worth come from Tesla, so let's ignore the other things for now. 

Tesla is currently the most valuable asset cat company in the world. In fact, it's worth more than the next 5 biggest combined. So it's easy to see how a major owner and leader of the by far most valuable car company in the world could have a high net worth. 

Remember those wealth number just list net worth. They are not just counting his cash in the bank. It's highly unlikely he could sell all his stock and realise that kind of money without the stock tanking.

Now, from the way you've phrased your question or sounds like you doubt the value of Tesla. You may be right of course, and if you are his net worth will go down as others figure it out. However the reason a lot of people value it so highly goes something like this:
A companies value is not determined by what its doing right now. If I had a dollar but knew it was about to turn into $100, I wouldn't sell it for a dollar. I wouldn't even sell it for $50, I'd probably value it at very close to $100. So people are looking at Tesla and trying to work out what it will turn into over the next decades. 
They only sold a bit over 1% of new cars, but they certainly didn't sell them at the average price. These are expensive cars globally.

Now we get to electric cars. A lot of people think there won't be many petrol cars sold in 10 to 20 years. Tesla sold double as many electric cars than its next competitor in 2021. So the bet is, is it easier for existing auto makers to switch their factories to electric cars? Or is it easier for Tesla to build new factories? If it is easier for existing car manufacturers to convert factories, how did Tesla get such a huge lead inf the first place?

Now everything I've said about Tesla has little to do with economics and could be all wrong. But the stock is valued that high because there are people who believe it, and demonstrate that with their wallet by buying a piece of the company for what they think the company will be worth. Elon Musks net worth is calculated based on the amount investors show they believe the company is worth by buying shares, divide by the portion he owns.

Remember Bill Gates didn't become a billionaire in the current era. He did it in the 80s. Only about 5 million PC's were sold that year. He was a billionaire long before his Microsoft was ubiquitous in every household. 

And so Elon Musk has a high net worth before his companies either have an impact commensurate with their valuations, or decline with his net worth to follow."

I am a failed real estate investor. Here's what I learned.,"I am an active investor(and agent) and can agree that there are some major difficulties and you certainly do have to assess and be comfortable with the risk involved.  From your story it sounds like your property manager was a disaster.  That is not surprising at all.  It’s a hard job and most property managers are terrible.  They can make or break your experience.  A secondary problem seems to be the condition of the properties.  Stuff breaks, that is par for the course.  However, when you purchase and go through the inspection process you should have some idea how much you will be spending on repairs.  Current repairs and future capital expenditures should be in your budget.  I buy to renovate and expect low out of pocket expenses in the first few years after renovation.  I prefer to spend the money up front and save some future headaches, plus this helps me drive up the value of my properties.  If you buy a property with a lot of differed maintenance or where many of the major systems are at/near the end of their useful life then you have to be prepared for regular large expenditures until the major systems are more up to date.  In my opinion your agent should have prepared you a little more for that but not all agents know investing.  Sorry to hear it didn’t go as well as you had hoped.  Thanks for sharing your story!"

How is Japan not completely dominating the world economy?,"Japan's heyday was in the 1970s and 80s. Especially [compared with their peer economies](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us-single-benchmark?time=1950..latest&amp;country=KOR~JPN~USA), growth slowed down in the 1990s and 2000s (referred to as the ""[Lost Decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades)"").  This occured at first because of the [1990s Japanese banking crisis](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2000/wp0007.pdf), and then because of a shrinking workforce and rising adult dependecy ratio. The demographic issue of an aging population is here to stay.  The Japanese are extremely adverse to allowing immigrants, and attempts to raise the fertility rate have had essentially no impact. There is essentially no plausible solution to their long term economic slowdown."
Can solo algo trader get an edge / market alpha strategy?,"Yes. In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. 

First and foremost, small trades (I mean &lt;$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered ""non-toxic"" and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. 

The markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved. To think that ""I can't do this because someone bigger and smarter already does"" is defeatist and incorrect. Good strategies make money; bad ones don't - simple as that."

"Warning: AT&amp;T applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent","About a month ago, AT&amp;T decided I needed an upgrade so they picked one out for me.

I looked into why I was getting hit for another AT&amp;T charge and found it was for ordering a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.  Then I got an email thanking me for my order.

When I called them, I thought someone hacked my account and was buying shit.  After a brief conversation, they told me it was a promotion offering me an upgrade and that I wouldn't be charged.  I told them I already had, the money has left my bank account without my approval, this was now theft.

After talking to many people I got them to refund the order, refund my last two bills, and cancel my AT&amp;T account.

4) The biggest challenge is trying to get buy-in on complex methods from team members without an economics background. However, this is usually beneficial to the report as it helps me thinking about writing for a more general audience including most of Congress, who don't have a degree in economics.

"Would boycotting companies who use child labor or other inhumane businesses practices help the employees be treated better, or would it just lead to them being unemployed and even worse off?","Far from being dumb or ignorant, it is indeed a very intelligent and legitimate question . Here is an excerpt from a paper that investigates this issue: 

""A common perception is that most child laborers work for wages in the formal sector, conjuring images of children working long hours in sweatshops or toiling away in mines. As a result, consumer boycotts and trade sanctions against products using child labor as an input are often discussed as means of reducing the incidence of child labor. In reality, however, such methods may have little impact for several reasons. Firstly, nearly 70 percent of working children are active in the agricultural sector, rather than manufacturing (ILO, 2006). Secondly, very few children work for wages outside the home; rather, most children are employed by their parents on the family farm or enterprise (Edmonds and Pavcnik, 2005). As a result, the majority of child laborers will not be affected by boycotts and trading sanctions. Further, children working in the affected sectors may simply relocate to an unaffected sector. Similarly, an outright ban on child labor would in most cases be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and as such would likely to have little effect on the overall incidence of child labor. In the worst case, a ban could end up making some children significantly worse off if these children are compelled to work in order to keep themselves and their families out of extreme poverty. This is not to say that bans are never motivated; clearly a ban on illegal and hazardous activities is desirable. However, additional policy instruments are necessary in order to effectively combat child labor.""

How does old money stay wealthy?,"People here might not like it but:

Family culture and strict traditional upbringing for future generations. 


You can have all the money in the world, but all it takes is for junior to grow up to be an entitled prick playboy one time and it can all be lost overnight. 

Most old line families instill charity, hard work, and at least some degree of real world responsibility in their children from an early age. Think the royal family continuing to enlist their heirs in the military even during active conflicts."

I think I’m done,Obviously your reacting to the recent events. You may want to step back and reevaluate. There are so many positive things on the horizon and after all the price only fell a few hundred dollars. I think that's a testament to the strength of Ethereum. Not trying to talk you out of or it into anything. But you are reacting immediately after the dip. There was a guy here a few weeks ago who sold at $2300. If he waited about  3 more weeks he would of profited another $250k. We've been waiting a long time to get to critical mass where Ethereum just takes off. I think it's close and I hate to see anyone make a poor decision. The fundamentals of Ethereum have not changed in fact they are stronger than ever. Best of luck to you and I just wanted to add my 2 cents
Why the hell do we have rent control in various cities when economists mostly agree it’s not good?,"See my username.

It is bad for society, bad for new/future residents, bad for a city as a whole.  That's basically the economic story, but I don't think you are asking why it is bad.

So why do we have it?

Because it is great for for current renters and current renters vote.  They outnumber landlords (many landlords probably don't even live in the same local political zone as their properties) and are easily moved by self-interest.  Nobody likes paying rent, so it is really easy to vote for a candidate who is going to keep yours down.

Why does it continue in places where it is having a clear adverse effect?

Same reason basically.  The local tenants control who gets elected.  Any long time resident is heavily benefiting from rent control so they want to to stick around.  The people who are harmed most, such as those who can't find an apartment, don't live there and don't vote in the district.  

Second answer is just that a lot of people don't understand.  They see super high rents in non-rent controlled units and see it as evidence that rent control works.  Instead of blaming the rent controlled units for the problem, they get jealous and wish they had one themselves... They aren't going to vote against the thing they aspire to eventually have!

But mainly I think the story is that in most places with rent control, renters control the politicians who wrote the laws rebuilding rent.  They vote their own self interest and the politicians follow.

edit: last night after posting this I listened to the rebroadcast [Freakonomics podcast about rent control](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/rent-control-rebroadcast/).  Really good listen if you are interested in this stuff."

What would happen if all companies were employee owned?,"I made a video about this recently if you’d like a fuller explanation: https://youtu.be/6Dh_-lFOQAg

The short of it is that businesses would likely be much smaller on an individual level, more fragmented, and likely yield higher paid employees who are less likely to be laid off because laying and employee off with equity would mean the equity would need to be paid out. However, hiring would probably be more arduous and structural unemployment would likely go up significantly because of the associated bureaucracy (voting on each new employee) and cost (every current employee’s equity and share of profits being diluted) of hiring.   

To clear something up, worker ownership is socialism at a systematic level. If all companies were owned by employees, this would be considered market socialism and/or socialism because the means of production would be owned by the workers/employees."

The penalties are obviously something that isn't even worth worrying about which is the whole point of this idiocracy.

Why are workers taxed harder than investors?,"There is a theoretical literature that studies the optimal way to fund government spending.

In the simplest optimal taxation models, you want to tax labor instead of capital. In those models, the optimal tax on capital is zero. 

The reason is that most forms of taxation distort equilibrium prices and this creates inefficiencies. Capital taxes create more inefficiencies because of the dynamic nature of savings and capital. 

In reality life, the story is much more complicated than in those models and there are reasons to tax capital. But the intuition of the model persists. Taxing capital generates  inter-temporal distortions that you want to avoid.

One important thing to take into account is that capital is different from wealth. This is a distinction that wasn’t made in the past. The idea of taxing wealth has picked up a lot of interest lately.

Here is a recent paper (I think it is forthcoming in QJE) that discusses these ideas and, in particular, it explains when you would like to tax wealth

How long did it take you to become consistently profitable?,"I've been trading since 1996'ish.  In that time I've traded just about every type of market condition there is.  Made a ton of money during the internet boom because all you had to do was trade a .com name and made a fortune.  I was on top of the world, king of the castle, the head honcho... then came the internet crash and I lost every damn penny chasing the dragon, and then some.  

Unfortunately, I'm seeing a very similar mindset now as I did during the internet boom.  Everyone thinks they can make money and everyone is an expert.  Well, I'm not here to tell you not to chase your dreams and give it a shot, heck, I love the added volatility/liquidity, just try not to do it with money you aren't prepared to lose (I'm speaking from firsthand experience here).

To answer your question, it took me about 7 years to become a decent profitable trader and about 15 years to become a damn good one. Don't get me wrong, I was profitable for most of those first 7 years (minus the internet bust blowup) but my personal volatility was off the charts.

My advice is to keep it simple.  Don't get caught up in trading all sorts of different vehicles, pick one, and learn it like the back of your hand.  Become the master of that one thing.  Then just grind it out.  All I trade is the /YM now.  That's it, nothing else.  (I also manage my own investments but that's not trading).

Next, don't trade just to trade, only trade when the setup is proper.  Patience is definitely the key here.  Don't rush into trades, don't trade just because you haven't done so in a while, don't force anything.  There have been weeks where I don't place a single trade.  

Finally, learn when to sell losers.  It's more important (by a little) than knowing when to sell for a gain.  Cut your losses and you can live to play again tomorrow.

"🚀 Time to expose the shell game. FTDs can be ""reset"" through borrowing from ETFs. Read the Truth.","If I'm reading those rules correctly, anyone margin called will have until the next business day end to cough up the dough, which I didn't know so thanks for that.

So as an example, if the price were to rise like crazy on Apr 22 at noon, closing the day at over $500, smaller short funds would receive margin calls that night and have until 4pm Apr 23 to deliver, or be bent over by their prime brokers/lenders? Meaning it is critically important that people hold and not freak out at 500/1000/whatever - you need to hodl for both the price to rise AND the margin call time requirements to pass. After a solid 2 days of being above $800 every fund on the planet who was short should have received their margin call and the chain reaction can begin."

"Why does real estate in Japan, seemingly unique among developed economies, behave as a depreciating asset?","Earthquakes, population decline, and arguably some policy related to zoning.

First off, we should note its the house, and not usually the land that depreciates. This is in large part because of earthquakes. People do not want to buy old houses because they dont meet the most recent earthquake standards. Earthquakes also cause structural damage sometimes, so older houses may be less safe.

https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/03/15/why-japanese-houses-have-such-limited-lifespans

Youth cohorts are also small compared to the population, and population is declining, limiting demand.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Japan_Population_by_Age_1920-2010_with_Projection_to_2060.png

Some people argue that zoning laws play the largest part in this--mainly that there is little form of zoning in Japan at all. I think it has a limited impact, but given that this is a recent phenomenon and the zoning measures mostly aren't, I highly doubt this is the whole story*. In the 80s Japanese housing had insane price runs despite the zoning laws being quite similar. This would suggest that recent population pressures are a very significant part of the lower increases, or in some areas decreases, of housing costs. So I wont go into detail on these policies.

Why is Nvidia Valued so much higher than Intel?,"INTC feel behind on technology and picked up a reputation for fumbling rollouts while AMD and NVDA pick up a reputation for innovation and excellence.

INTC got too big and took too long to respond to the challengers and INTC has been losing market share. INTC has a good looking lineup of new chips rolling out over the coming year and has a good chance of stopping up the market share losses.

INTC also has made a lot of investments in upcoming tech and should be poised for a big rebound but right now momentum is against it and momentum is with it's competitors.

INTC is a safe buy at these prices but I don't know when the market will start giving it an appropriate valuation. I have been long for over a year and it has not paid off. Frustrating to watch NVDA and AMD just rocket to crazy valuations."

Why don’t you own Berkshire Hathaway?,"I don’t own it - to my detriment - but here’s the reasons

1) Warren/Charlie do not have a lot of years left, I don’t have confidence in Abel and am not willing to see how he does with the training wheels off.

2) There are better businesses in many of their conglomerates (eg buy Progressive instead of Geico). I get that you lose the float leverage but am willing to do that.

3) Can replicate their OTC holdings if I wish, I’m not interested in buying an Apple, Verizon, etc holding company

4) I hate owning insurance companies and banks, personal bias

5) Difficult to value, especially after Accounting Standards Update No.2016-01 to mark fair value. This is more laziness on my part and I don’t want to do a P/B shorthand.

6) Despite an amazing investment in Apple I still feel this company doesn’t understand the tech sector and that is where outsized market gains will continue to come from even with rising rates. Investments in IBM and HP are just scary.

What are the most contested and cutting-edge questions in economics today?,"Economics is a huge field with a *lot* of topics being researched. Just a select few off the top of my head:

- In the macro world, why are interest rates so low (not just today, but even pre-COVID)? There are a [number of competing theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/s4zs7s/why_are_longterm_interest_rates_so_low_is_larry/hsus29m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3), with the main ones being global savings glut, secular stagnation, and a shift towards less risky assets (this is explored in more detail in the link).
- In labor economics, the effects of minimum wage on employment is still frequently researched. The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage/) covers the topic well. Research has revealed that minimum wages don’t always lead to large employment losses, so most research today is focused on the question of at what level (or under what conditions) minimum wages could become more problematic.
- In developmental economics, there is lots of cool research going on trying to answer the question of “how do we make very poor people better off?” I highly suggest “Poor Economics” by Banerjee &amp; Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates) as a non-technical read on the subject. It remains my favourite non-technical econ book.
- Climate economics is a very active field. We’re still learning about the many inter-connected ways that climate change will impact the world, and thus the economy."

"I'm 18 and about to earn $73,000 a year.","Understand a few things:

1-You are a warm body in a very lucrative field.   Every warm body makes (perceptually for low to middle class young guys) crazy money.  

2-You will trade your body and sanity for that money and can only do it for so long 

3-In order to maintain morale, and sanity mentioned in (2), your co-workers will purchase expensive cars, drugs, clothes, etc.   ""Work hard, party hard"".  I have a few buds that constantly post pictures of their massive trucks, big wads of cash (big being a very relative word), etc etc.

4-Falling for (3) will lead you to continue to trade your body for this demanding and unforgiving job which actually does NOT pay much considering the hours actually involved, the danger, the toll on your body



Take home points:   
i- Save (as much % of the net pay that you can and invest your money).   You will make more than the other 18 year olds, but the cost will not be seen to you until a decade or so later if you decide to make this a long term job of many years. 

ii-Have an out plan.  Study when you can for a normal career or something lucrative

iii-Don't talk about how much money you THINK you're making.   Don't brag about how much you are making on social media.  Trust me, its really not that much.   There are accountants, programmers, etc who beat that while working 9-5 and sitting on their ass drinking coffee.   The other difference?  The accountant/programmer/etc. can keep working into their 60s and 70s.

iv-To follow up on (i):Invest in index funds that follow the market to start, in your late 20s after you've studied a few different investment mediums like individual stocks, realestate, etc. then feel free to go into riskier and more lucrative investments

good luck!

Why is the United States so rich?,"This question is too broad to provide a definitive answer to. ""Why are some countries richer than others?"" is *the* fundamental question in the field of macroeconomic growth and development. Getting a comprehensive answer would require taking a semester long course on growth and development (at the very least).

We know a little bit more about what are typically called ""proximate"" causes (for a general framework, see [here](http://klenow.com/DevelopmentAccounting.pdf)). This answers the question of how the US makes more stuff than (say) France, in a literal physical sense. The short answer here is that generally speaking about 10-30 percent of the difference is explained by education and skill differences (""human capital""), 20 percent is explain by more and better machines (""physical capital""), and 50-70 percent is explained by ""total factor productivity"" (TFP), which is basically a term meaning ""everything else that is harder to measure/quantify"".

Given its large role in explaining income differences, the last few decades of growth research has mostly involved trying to break down TFP and determine/quantify its various components. I will defer to the previously linked paper if you want further discussion of this.

But this leaves open the question: why was it the US, in particular, that ended up with high human capital, physical capital, and TFP? Why not Argentina or some other country? These are effectively the first sets of arrows in the framework I linked.

This is a much broader and more open question without a conclusive answer. The answer seems be to lots of little things from history (WWII, colonialism, etc) to geography to culture to simple randomness. I'm unaware of the solid lit review covering all of this, and it's beyond the scope of this post. The gist is: there's a lot here that we don't really know and this bit in particular is still an active area of research.

Anyways, that's my quick summary. There is also a cheap answer to your question that I have saved for the end (because apparently I wanted to write a post about development accounting). This is that the US simply works more hours than many of these countries which lets them make more income. If you look at [output per hour worked](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/labor-productivity-per-hour-pennworldtable?tab=table), the US is still near the top but it isn't a crazy outlier."

Question from a microeconomics final that I wrote 11 years ago,"Use [revealed preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference#The_Weak_Axiom_of_Revealed_Preference_(WARP). She has some utility function

U(bar, x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)

that may be time-dependent as well. What matters is that she chose to attend that bar at that time, as opposed to other options.

The key is that we don't know how her constraints played into her decision to attend at the time. Hence, while going to the bar at the same time might be smart, you need to do more to ensure that deciding to go to the bar again is [individually rational](https://www.econlib.org/book-chapters/chapter-ch-4-individual-rationality-in-social-choice/) for her. 

So, you make a deal with the bar owner/bartender to make a drink cheaper, or something that that reduces her cost of attendance. ""But it'll be very expensive if I have to strike a deal!"" Then you write out your intertemporal utility maximization problem, where your goal is to (potentially) marry this lady, but in the short run you'd have to pay the cost of the deal with the bartender (Note that the goal is probably to just meet this lady and get to know her more, with the possibility than you go on to want to marry her, but that depends on signals and whatnot; since it's an exam I think this can be mentioned in a line, while you just simplify the goal to marriage, due to limited time). I'd recommend writing search theory [Bellman equation(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) for this portion, and characterizing the reservation cost of a deal you strike with the bartender using standard assumptions on utility/production functions, i.e. the cost that makes you indifferent between a deal and no deal. See how you can apply the [Slutsky equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slutsky_equation) to her decision-making process.

These parts can be answered in maybe 2/3 a page of writing/equations with normal-sized handwriting, which I think is reasonable for an exam question.

If you have time remaining, I'd definitely go into complements and substitutes. The day of the week matters here. My prior is that going to the bar on a Friday night is complementary to going to the bar next Friday night, but is a substitute for going to the bar on Saturday night. Going to the bar on, say, a Monday night is probably not a complement with anything, as the impression I have is that people unfortunately tend to do that when going through a rough time. But I don't drink, so I wouldn't know.

*Note: this question is open-ended and most likely will accept multiple answers. It probably wants to test your economic reasoning.*

Edit: I mixed up individual rationality with incentive compatibility at first."

&gt; take advise from people who are better smarter richer than you 

I'm not sure on this one. Personally, I consider ""advice"" pointed out by others; but I try to evaluate any advice received based on first principles.

I've met people 1000x richer than me, dumb as brick - some people are lucky, and do fail upwards in life. 

As for smarter, just because someone's smart in one domain, doesn't mean they'd be smart in others. Especially, with most Indians, I've seen they choose to ignore skilling up in personal financial matters, even if they are nuclear scientists at their jobs (not an exaggeration, knew someone from BARC).

"Are ""the rich getting richer"" and ""the poor getting poorer""?","The share of wealth of the top 1% and top 10% has been relatively stable over the last two centuries.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319227140/figure/fig2/AS:669671804117000@1536673608298/Figure-no-1-Wealth-inequality-Europe-and-the-US-1810-2010.png

And up until recently, the real wealth of the bottom 90% has grown quite steadily.

https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415705163748/7200feb5-69a6-43f2-a5ee-9f7251941be4-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57369e63eaa177bb49e9cab4c3391f68

So no, there is no general trend of the poor getting poorer. The rich get richer and the poor also get richer. The poor just haven't been able to recover from the last recession.

That said, I'm not necessarily comfortable with using household data since household wealth might also be driven by household composition.

People get richer the older they get, simply by virtue of having more time to accumulate wealth and earning more money later in their careers, so if people for example marry later in their lives now, their households, and their household wealth, is smaller for longer periods in their lives.

Sadly I can't seem to find much data on individual wealth."
What do economists think of market socialism?,"The problem with this approach is that it creates a mismatch between supply of and and demand for capital. Different industries have wildly different capital to labor ratios, so you end up with situations where, e.g., landscapers own very little capital while factory workers own huge amounts of capital, despite these jobs having similar skill requirements.

How does that happen? It's not hard to buy landscaping tools, but how does a worker fresh out of high school get the cash to buy a share of a factory so he can work there?

Maybe the factory worker doesn't have to buy in, but gets shares of the factory in addition to a salary. So he must get paid a lot less than the landscaper. But that's okay, since he has savings in the form of factory shares which I guess he'll sell to new workers when he retires. Unless the factory goes bust. Then he's kind of screwed. Investing your life's savings in one business isn't a great idea. Also, if the factory goes through a rough spell and loses money for several years, how do workers get paid?

Meanwhile, the landscaper is living large on pure cash compensation. He's making so much money that he decides to save some and invest it in...what, exactly? There's no stock market because the means of production are all owned by the workers. Some market socialists allow the issuing of bonds, although it's never really been clear to me why buying a portion of future EBITDA via lending is kosher while doing so via equity is not. So there's an option, maybe.

Elsewhere, a group of young geniuses have a great idea and want to start a business. Let's say that after five years it has a 90% chance of failure and a 10% chance of making $10 billion. They need $5 million dollars to pay their business and living expenses for the next 5 years. They do not have this money. Lending is not a good way to fund this because of the high risk of failure. Equity investment would be ideal for this situation, but that's not allowed, because workers have to own the means of production. So they just go to work at existing companies.

To summarize, a non-exhaustive list of the problems:

1. People who have cash to invest and people who need capital to do their jobs are often not the same people. This is an especially big problem for forming new firms, since bootstrapping is infeasible in industries that require large up-front investments.

2. Workers who save money benefit from the ability to diversify their investments. Investing exclusively in the company where you work is a really bad idea.

3. Often less-skilled workers simply are not productive enough that they can afford to take a large share of their total compensation in the form of shares.

We have capital markets in order to allocate capital efficiently and mitigate risk. When you don't allow the roles of worker and investor to be played by different people, that doesn't happen.

Furthermore, workers who want to own the means of production can do that right now. All we have to do is set aside some of our pay to invest in the stock market. Preferably in an index fund instead of just one company."

My message, especially to people moving into their 30s is that Real estate needs due diligence and patient holding, but it is a asset class everyone should seriously consider as a part of portfolio. Don't be greedy but don't live in fear either. 

However, one might invest somewhere (attractive investment) and live somewhere else (near office/school/nightlife), for which rental is perfect, and if that was the point, pls ignore me."
How are most crypto currencies not Ponzi scheme?,"I'm going to answer this from a legal perspective because there's a prevalent misconception of what a ""Ponzi scheme"" is.  The short answer is that what you're describing is not a ""Ponzi scheme.""  In a Ponzi scheme, a person invests in a business and is paid at regular intervals with funds from subsequent investors.  A Ponzi scheme involves the investors being deceived as to the sources/legitimacy of the funds used to pay them.

Crypto currencies don't work that way. If you buy one bitcoin, that's it. You own a bitcoin that might go up or down in value, but you aren't being paid in cash with funds from subsequent investors.  The only way you get cash is by selling the bitcoin, and there's no deception or mystery about where that money is coming from. So crypto currencies are not a ""Ponzi scheme.""

That's not to say crypto currencies are a good investment; beanie babies weren't a ""Ponzi scheme,"" but they also weren't a good investment.  It's also not to say that the ""investment advice"" people give about crypto currencies is legal. What you're referring to is something more like a [pump and dump scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump), where people artificially inflate the value of an asset with misleading statements.  That's much harder to prove than a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty easy to prove someone is lying about the source of a business's revenue if there's no legitimate business activity going on. It's much harder to prove someone is knowingly lying when they say, ""I think the value of \[madeup coin\] will increase 10%."""

are billionares bad for capitalism?,"Your question assumes that billionaires’ wealth is mostly made up of cash. But it’s the opposite actually, they typically owns assets that are worth billions in the open market today.

In essence what that means is they bought/invested in those assets with some cash at some point. And the recipients of that cash (typically some company), deployed that cash in a value creating manner for the public i.e. they provided goods and services that generate profits. The goods and services generate profits because the customers value them and are willing to spend money on it. In addition they generate profits because the company created the goods and services efficiently, in other words it costs them less to create than what customers are willing to pay. 

So billionaires cash is actually being put to work in the market, and this is actually the essence of capitalism. Letting people choose where they want to spend their money, and in return giving them ownership of what they buy. In fact, this works the same whether you’re a billionaire or not. For most people with any retirement account, they don’t actually have much cash. They’ve given their cash to someone else (usually another investor) who uses that cash however they want. This is all overly simplified but it’s meant to address your assumption and explain how the money is being used."
"Do USA really borrow money from countries like India? If so, why?","Nations borrow by issuing bonds. They sells bonds at auctions. The bond then pays a payment over some number of years, that's called the coupon. At the end the principle is paid back.

So, you could buy a bond with a face value of $100. It might pay, say, $2 every year. Then after 10 years, for example, the government will pay the entire $100 back. This bond is auction off to the highest bidder and then can be traded on the bond market.

As a result, all sorts of people and organizations own bonds. Nearly anyone who wants to can buy bonds. Though some countries have laws limiting buying bonds from other countries they consider hostile.

Many governments buy the bonds of other governments. That is all about controlling forex rates. Government like to have the ability to prevent steep declines in forex rates. To prevent that they intervene in the forex market and buy their own currency paying with another currency. Very often that other currency is the US dollar. Rather than holding dollars countries often hold bonds which can easily be sold in exchange for dollars.

Imagine that there's an emergency of some sort in India and the value of the rupee falls. The government needs to import some goods to deal with the emergency. They hold US bonds which they can sell for dollars then they can buy the goods for import with those dollars."

Mom nearing 60 has no savings. Where to start?,"I am going to paste something I posted in another thread a while back for another person asking for advice. You are not to this point yet, but it is coming and maybe this will give you some pointers based on my personal situation. Below is my current situation....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

I had a similar situation with my father. He came to me one day and told me he had been getting money from people at his church to avoid being homeless, but they weren't giving him any more because he wasn't taking any steps to rectify his issues. He needed to borrow some money to pay his rent and I didnt want to give him money because I knew he would need it every month. His only retirement income is social security. Below is how I tackled the problem...

I told him I would help him, but only if he tuned his finances over to me 100%. He gets about 1300 per month social security. He had no choice but to agree. He had several payday type loans, credit card debt and had gotten a new loan against his paid off car. He basically used every form of credit he had access to and maxed everything out.

1. I opened a checking account in my name only at his bank
2. I opened a savings account in both of our names at his bank
3. We called the social security office and changed his check to be deposited into the savings account (he cant write checks against a savings account)
4. When his check is deposited I transfer it to my checking account
5. I transfer 60 bucks every Monday into the savings account for him to withdraw. This is for food, fuel and every expense he has
6. I pay all of his bills from my checking account ( which only has his money in it)
7. I called the payday loan places and told them I hired an attorney ( I didn't), called the better business bureau and the consumer protection agency. I told them the lawyer I hired actually offered to handle this for free because his father went through the same thing and he was eager to make them pay again. All of them dropped all of his debt and wiped the slate clean. Bluff worked. In my state it is illegal for them to take post dated checks and they still do it because nobody knows any better. I had the law on my side so that helped with the bluff. The loan companies knew they would not stand a chance in court.
8. I met with the bank manager and explained what I was doing so that she could help me watch his accounts and understand the weird movement of money.
9. I closed his checking account so that no more checks could bounce against it
10. He moved into a controlled rent home where his rent is determined by his income
11. He lived on 40 bucks a week until I got his payments under control. Now he gets 60 and he has 5 grand saved up that he doesn't know about. When he has an emergency, like dental needs or doctor or new tires, I use the money from his account. He thinks I pay for it out of my pocket. On this system he saves around 100 bucks per month but thinks he breaks even.

I can't tell him he has a nest egg because he absolutely sucks with money and is like a child with it. He would find a reason to need it within days and would blow it at the bar where he drinks with his VA friends. I told him if I caught him hiding money from me, or lying to me to get money, or being deceiving in any way I would close the checking account, take my name off the saving account and would not help him anymore. He is an adult and is responsible for himself.

I never had much of a relationship with him but feel that being the first born son is a big deal. I feel, as the first born son, I am responsible and my duties are not noble or charitable but a requirement for a family unit to maintain its integrity.

I hope this is helpful for you, but either way I wish you luck and even though I don't know your name you will be in my prayers. Life is hard, but it is even harder when your parents can't hold up their end of the deal. Whatever you do, do not strip them of their dignity, do not publicly shame them or give them reason to feel ashamed. They made a life error that they won't recover from, but they were blessed enough to have children that love them. They are fortunate. What you are going through now and how you are handling it will be one of the reasons you will be able to lay your head on your pillow at night and sleep soundly later in life. We do what is right not because it is easy, but because we go through enough shit in life to not have to be haunted by the wrongs of our youth."

Where are all the non-rich people?,"36k earner here from Austria! That translates to 1.8k netto monthly. It has been my salary for about 2 years now. Previously my salary was 26k/1.4k netto (PhD student) for about 3 years after which I was unemployed for 1½ years. My salary during that time was about 20k/1.1k netto. All of these numbers are [below the median Austrian household income](http://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/PeopleSociety/social_statistics/household_income/index.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202020%20EU,per%20annum%20at%20their%20disposal.). 

Most people tend to invest with whatever ""left over"" income they have at the end of the month. For me, it has always been the opposite - I'd always take out a fixed sum (even when I was unemployed) and lock it away. Then I'd figure out how to make do with what was left over. Despite the fact that I am making more than I used to, this habit has stuck. In my head, my salary is still just 1.4k. If I could make do on that salary for 3 years, I can jolly well do it now. As soon as the paycheck comes in, I lock 300 to 500 away and then figure out how to deal with the rest. 

This sub has definitely been helpful for me and a few friends of mine. We are all in the 20k to 40k range. Based on what we've learned here, we've all started off a Sparplan and are putting away anywhere between €50 and €300 a month on the regular. It ain't much, but it's honest investing!

We all have anywhere between 1k and 4k as emergency funds and whenever we have spare cash, we stash it away and have anywhere between €100 and 5k saved over the span of a few months to a few years that we use for buying big dips whenever they happen. It's likely a good idea to invest this sum instead of trying to time the market, but we prefer doing it this way because transaction fees are ridiculous unless you go via a Sparplan."
Why is The Fed printing $2T not risking hyperinflation (while other countries in the past printing money had resulted in that),"In the case of what the fed does right now, they are providing relief for a lack of liquidity through collateralised short term loans. Once those loans are paid back, the money is destroyed again. It's also not really money that enters the ""general economy"" but just to fulfill outstanding debt obligations between companies and banks.

What countries like Venezuela did is different. They fund their governments through money creation, so the government can buy goods and services. That is money that does enter the economy, leading to inflation."

Why does no one seem to think the housing market will crash?,"The first point is that it's spectacularly hard to time bubbles. I haven't heard anyone say that prices will rise monotonically, and I would be skeptical of anyone who says they can predict year over year changes for the next twenty years. I certainly can't. There are also semantic questions of what exactly a ""crash"" is (are dropping prices a crash? is it determined by foreclosures?).

Still, limiting ourselves to the near term (maybe the next five years), we can look at various reasons for why home prices are going up and ask ourselves if we think that these reasons could be signs of an impending crash. 

On the demand side, one of the largest reasons for why some many people want homes now is that interest rates are at historic lows. It is considerably [cheaper to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage than it ever has been](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US). This will push up the price of homes because it means that more people are able to afford them. Importantly, [foreclosures are also at record lows](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/foreclosures-fell-to-record-low-in-2020/) (with the very important caveat that while they are especially low currently because the [Federal Government has issued a freeze on foreclosures for homes with federally backed mortgages](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_21_009)). There will likely be an uptick on foreclosures when the moratorium lifts, as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that [more homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103273/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 24). However, compared to the Great Recession, which saw historic levels of foreclosures on the backs of predatory loans, the low interest rates do not seem to be inviting people to take out loans they truly cannot afford. 

On the supply side, the number of homes we are building has not kept pace with the increased demand for homes. The stock of available housing, which peaked in 2011 [has hit a historic low](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103273/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 20). This has been [exacerbated by the pandemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-underbuilding-housing-over-the-past-decade-2020-9), which caused many construction firms to cease production during the otherwise peak summer months.  [Housing construction has been trending up in the last decade](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/housing-starts); it just hasn't kept pace with demand. 

It's possible that these trends will reverse. Interest rates could go up and the relative housing supply could increase. Both of these would push down prices. Still, something like the Great Recession where a substantial number of homeowners are unable to make their payments seems unlikely. The rise in foreclosures was driven by predatory loans where repayment relied on the promise of refinancing based on increased equity. I don't see evidence that this is happening. Maybe housing prices will fall (or at least stop increasing faster than inflation) in the next 10 years -- I don't know -- but I would not predict the housing market to collapse in the next few years."

Is there any realistic scenario where the cost of homes can come down again?,"The government could restrict home purchases to residents, increase interest rates, increase property tax, and implement a vacant home tax.

"Covid, Brexit and now the Suez channel blocked, seriously why is the stock market still going up?","The stock market is not the economy. The stock market consists disproportionately of medium and large companies. Different companies also depend on different markets, countries and supply chains. 
So Brexit might not matter much for a business that does not operate in Britain - they can workaround the problems. The Suez channel blocking is bad for supply chains, but the relative ability of different companies to supply is hurt almost equally. On top of this, the Suez channel situation is temporary and will be over in two weeks at most (if the ships rerout around South Africa). 
The value of a stock depends on the perceived ability of a company to be profitable long term.
Covid hurt small businesses disproportionately, and the end is in sight. Brexit caused some slowdown on the markets I think, but it also offers new opportunities and doesn’t actually matter much for many companies worldwide. The channel, again, is a temporary issue. Even the loss of the entire ship’s cargo wouldn’t matter much, since all companies would miss out on only a single shipment (they’d still have products in store and get new products soon)."

"Curious to hear economists' breakdown of Einstein's ""Why Socialism?""","You should keep in mind that Einstein, while an excellent physicist, is about as educated in economics as your average Joe, and not instantly credible in the field of economics because he's good at physics. Same goes for an economist regarding physics. If an economist wrote a paper on general relativity with a bit more than average research (that probably isn't correct to begin with), would you take him seriously? Probably not. 

In the article, he seems to be essentially saying that economics is not a real science by comparing it to astronomy, which isn't a very good argument. The field of economics does have a set methodology they use to conduct research. See Econ methodology FAQ in the sidebar of this sub.

He then appears to make the ethical argument for socialism, which, while completely ok, is outside the scope of economics.

Overall this article isn't much different from any other. It ignores basic economic concepts and instead makes an ethical case, which an economist can't really respond to."
Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.,"While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

&gt;A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

&gt;It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

&gt;This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

&gt;they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

A beginner's guide to investing in the bond market (and debt mutual funds).,"One particular gem. among the many in the article

&gt; Decide on how many years you're going to invest the money. Divide the  time horizon (in years) by 3 or 5, and you'll get a number.   Select debt funds whose Average Maturity is (approximately) equal to that number. That's the simplest to do it. 

This is so important. You get so much of lazy advice that asks you to match the duration with the horizon. That is so hare-brained.   Your suggestion is so much better."

U.S. population barely grows; annual housing construction is 1.5 million. So how did we end up in a housing shortage? Is the market distorted by tax code?,"A housing shortage implies there are not enough houses where people need them, not that there aren’t enough houses as a raw count. 

I can build a million houses and offer free rent, but it means nothing to the people of NYC if I build them in rural Wyoming. And asking people to move as a solution to address housing isn’t feasible.

I’m also not going to lower my rent if I’m a landlord just because I know there’s an extra supply of housing. Tenants are a pain and my apartment feels unique to *me* – the location, the quality, my attentiveness to detail, the schools – I have every reason under the moon to think my rent is fair and will wait before I can’t find anyone before lowering the rent. That doesn’t make maintenance cheaper, taxes lower, or tenants less annoying."
Here are the answers to all your questions,"Fully agree with your thoughts. As somebody who found Thetagang through WSB, but never bought into the Yoloing because my risk tolerance just isn't there, you sum it up well.

Simple path that works for me - If I like the stock and am good with holding in lots of 100 shares, I consider the CSP. If I think it's got some room to run, but am ok selling at ""x"" price, I'll buy the 100 shares and sell a covered call. I don't do this with stocks I'm aiming to hold for long term. While collecting premium is nice, watching it grow for several years is also great - assuming you picked a winner.

  
Max profit with shares on a covered call is a huge win... Regardless of how ""painful"" it may feel."

We ordered from it the other day, and it was about 30/40 percent cheaper than anything on JustEat, and v tasty.

Furthermore, it seems these companies like JustEat, Deliveroo, etc are **massively inefficient.** The riders don't get much, the firm takes a big cut but doesn't make a profit, and the restaurant gets paid less per meal.

"Do western countries like UK, USA, etc. depend on the 'exploitation' of China, India and other third world countries to stay rich and prosperous?","Nope. 

For example, back in 1970, when the USA was already one of the richest countries on the planet by GDP per capita, US imports were only [5.2% of US GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS?end=2019&amp;locations=US&amp;start=1970&amp;view=chart). 

As for the UK, trade wasn't that important at the start of the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, Clark, O'Rourke and Taylor published a paper estimating that the the welfare impact of cutting off all trade, including not just colonies but also with countries like France (which you can literally see from places on the eastern coast of the UK) would be only 3-4% of national income, rising to 25-30% in the 1850s. (Note that this excludes the benefit of trade in ideas and new species such as potatoes.) 

Secondly, as observed by Adam Smith, back in *The Wealth of Nations*, it is better to have richer trading partners than poorer, but colonisation was inherently a destructive process. Smith distinguished carefully between the benefits of the discovery of the Americas and the harms of European colonisation, noting that many of the gains of the actual coloniers came at the expense not just of their victims but also higher prices and lower supply of colonial products in the 'home' countries. 

Consistent with this, the evidence is that, through the 19th century and up until the 1990s, rich countries traded more with other rich countries. 
See for example https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/exports-from-western-europe-to-other-regions?country=~Western+Europe

Or https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/merchandise-exports-by-continent?country=~USA

And much of the rise in trade between the West and poor countries in recent decades is driven by the rise in trade with China, where Chinese incomes have grown rapidly. 

This admittedly is talking about direct trade in goods and services, places like India and China have made major contributions to the international pool of scientific, technological and mathematical knowledge.

Separation with no savings,"I was exactly in your situation. We decided to stay separated by live in the same house, just different rooms, Luckily we had a guest room.

We lived amicably for 5 further years, both dating, but not finding anyone special. When the time came to move out, I basically gave her the house - it had $300,00 equity with a $110,00 mortgage. I figured she was about to re-enter the workforce with only a high school education, no super, whereas I had a good-paying job with decent super. I also paid $250 a week towards the boys expenses until they got a job. I didn't want her living on struggle street age 55 still scraping the mortgage together. She now owns her house outright, makes a good average wage and is very happy, kids are happy - I re-married and moved in with my new wife.

How do billionaires borrow against assets to avoid taxes?,"""Buy, Borrow, Die"" seems to be the term popularized to describe the strategy you are referencing. The basic idea is to exploit the step-up in basis that occurs upon death. The steps are (broadly)

1) Buy: (or create by starting a successful business) an asset and have it appreciate.  Say you spend $10 on a stock and it is now worth $20. You have $10 in capital gains.

2) Borrow: instead of selling $10 of stock and paying capital gains tax on $10, pledge $10 of stock as collateral for a loan of $10 that you can go spend as you see fit.

3) Die: keep holding the stock and the loan until you die. Your heir can sell the stock for $20 with no capital gains due to step-up basis rules, pay off your $10 loan, and have $10 leftover in cash (the original value of the stock.

You have spent $10 on a stock, used $10 of the gains to buy stuff with, and passed the original $10 to your descendant. Congratulations! You successfully avoided paying capital gains on the $10 of appreciation on your stock.

In this case, the bank is willing to lend because 1) the loan is fully collateralized and low-risk and 2) they can charge a small annual interest rate and make money. The borrower is willing to borrow because (assuming they are old enough), paying a small annual interest rate is dramatically cheap than paying capital gains tax.

You can google around with the phrase. I've yet to find any actual evidence that the rich use this particular loophole or any tax lawyers recommending it. Not saying that they don't, just that it only became well-known after the ProPublica piece referenced in the link you posted was published and so far speculation about the extent of its use is just that, speculation.

EDIT: Since a lot of people are asking, remember that the estate tax is (broadly speaking) levied on *net* assets.  Passing the $20 of stock and $10 of loan to your heir is taxed the same as passing $10 to your heir, and so the capital gains that were ""borrowed"" don't get hit by the estate tax either."
Why does no one seem to think the housing market will crash?,"The housing market is extremely difficult to project. If you look back you can find someone claiming a crash every year. Eventually someone is right, but even then it’s often times regional.  Now dipping further you need to look at inflation.  We have been through several significant inflationary periods in the past 100 years.  The Fed, President, and Congress all have very aggressive stances toward pushing the economy forward. Even Republicans. The question isn’t, “are we creating inflation?” It’s, “Should we spend 1, 2, or 3 trillion?”  

Eventually all of that excess cash infusion will make its way to main street and prices everywhere will rise. When prices rise wages rise.  When wages rise there is more spending and a growth cycle continues. Don’t get caught thinking it’s 2008 when it’s more like 1968."
I need to make 5k in 14 months,"If you are serious, consider this:

14 months are about 60 weeks. Subtract 4 weeks for ""holidays"" and you are left with 56.

So, go to each shop in your neighborhood and ask whether they are willing to give you work for 6 XY/hour, ideally 5 days a week, but 1 day a week is better than nothing, you then just need multiple jobs.

Jobs could include refilling shelves, cleaning, washing cars...

Thoughts on UK economy under Truss?,"I was born in 1972 and in my 50th year it's ironic we have a very similar setup to back then.

While we might get a consumer led mini-boom, it will be massively overshadowed by the looming financial catastrophe.

I don't see how they can support the pound now. If they raise rates they crash the housing market &amp; consumer confidence, and if they cut/do nothing they'll crash the pound even further.

Sure we have plenty of world class companies but many assemble goods/raw materials bought in from abroad (paid for in dollars) and global demographics are not favouring exporters (regardless of what country they're in).

I guess where things are different to the 70's is that labour shortages should persist so we'll probably not see such high unemployment. Inflation is likely to prove very sticky though. I went shopping today and while fruit and vegetables are still affordable things that used to be dirt cheap (like cheese sauce) are only for the super rich now!

In the medium to long term we're one of the very few countries where renewable energy works (i.e. we have an abundance of water and wind) and going forward can probably out-compete German manufacturing now they'll never again have affordable energy.

"Are landlords ""bad""?","There are many costs and risks associated with home ownership that people may prefer not to take on. These include risk associated with the price of the house going down, maintenance costs, and costs of buying/selling the house. Depending on the circumstances, renting rather than owning can be a great deal.

Say somebody had the option of choosing for the same exact unit whether to buy it, or have a landlord buy it and rent it from the landlord.

If the person buys the place they have to pay a down payment, real estate broker fees, legal fees, inspection costs, etc. up front. Then if the home price goes down, they stand to lose a significant amount of money. If they decide to move after a year, they have to pay realtors, lawyers, taxes, etc. again. If there's an issue with the house they have to be prepared to fix it themselves no matter the cost. And if they are unable to pay their mortgage, foreclosure is a much more burdensome process than eviction.

Alternatively with the rent situation, the renter can move in immediately after only paying a relatively small security deposit that's refundable. If the price of the house goes down, their rent remains the same. If they want to leave after a year, they can do so for no additional cost besides the moving truck.  If something is wrong with the house, the landlord has to fix it. If something is seriously wrong with the house, they can break the lease and move for no additional cost. 

The rent will be higher than the mortgage cost, but that comes with all the benefits listed above.

For many people, the rent scenario is actually preferred, but in order to rent they need a landlord to take on the ownership costs and risks. That is the service that a landlord provides and the value they add."

Are most rich people rich because they were born into it?,"I can't speak to the empirical facts, but simple logic decrees that these statements are not necessarily inconsistent:

""most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family""

vs. 

""only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.""

It is entirely possible that being born into a rich family carries a host of economic advantages other than inheritance. E.g., children of rich families might go to better schools, get better medical care, better support outside of schools, have wealthier and more influential people in their social networks, and have a better financial safety net if they want to do something risky, like starting a new business or running for political office. Even if no one inherited anything (e.g., if there was a 100% estate tax), you would still expect children of rich families to start out with a considerable advantage in terms of lifetime earnings."

"Bitfarms LTD (BITF.V / BFARF) DD, extremely undervalued crypto miner","Good DD right here, I recently sold my HIVE position and was looking to get back in but I think I'll head towards Bitfarms.

I would add some feedback on this, their operations are all located in Quebec where electrical rates are the lowest in Canada and Hydro-Quebec (electrical utility provider) has some programs aim at crypto mining companies. 

Having said that, I was reading an article that mentioned that there is some concerns about the increase electrical consumption, that may mean some potential restrictions in the future, but Bitfarms does have aggreements in place with Hydro and municipalities, and they barely use 50% of their capacity, so there is room for growth!"

Is it possible to have a shortage of low-skilled workers resulting from everyone being educated?,"No (and yes).  
First thing is that the price of any good or service in any given market is determined by the supply and demand of that specific service. Labor market, like it or not, is not different. So education and salaries, even if they are correlated since there are factors moderating their relation (like specialization) do not have a causal relationship.

  
Second, there is a gap between giving somebody high education, and having that person working in jobs related to his high education experience. You may be a mechanical engineer and end up working as a bartender. This is happening in many economies around the globe.

When you consider a closed environment (let's say that we lock everybody up in X country and nobody can enter or leave) if you give high education to 100% of the population, the only thing that is going to happen, is that these skills will decrease in value as there will be an oversupply, and probably, lack of enough demand. On the other hand, low skilled jobs will be in high demand, so the salaries of the first will go down, and the salaries of low skilled jobs will go up, and eventually, you will have people that are engineers and rather work in a low skilled job. So, no, education does not cause that shortage by itself.

  
But, and here comes the trick, we don't live in closed environments. If high skilled employees are not paid enough, before going to work to low skilled manual jobs, many will leave the country, and you will have a brain drain."

"David Graeber outlined our abundance of ""bullshit jobs""; how do we fix this problem?","&gt;A lot of his information seems to be gathered from surveys and talking to people about their jobs, what they do on a daily basis, and their opinion about how important their job is.

To put this into context, his data consists of things like survey of the readers of strike magazine, which has [very clear political leanings](https://m.facebook.com/strikemagyo/) as well as literal dinner table conversations. Reliable empirical work is scarce to nonexistent.

The problems with that should be obvious. But to be a bit more precise, how people feel about and judge their job does not just depend on the nature of their work, but also things like societal perception, management performance, your age, or if you like your boss and coworkers.

Not to mention that picking representative samples should be absolutely paramount to good research, and getting your samples from a group with obvious biases is the opposite of that.

I also shouldn't have to mention that if your work is societally useful or not does not depend on whether you like Susan sitting at the desk next to you or not.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329366731_Socially_Useless_Jobs

And his work does not hold up to direct scrutiny, either. He makes an entirely unwarranted jump from the subjective perceptions on the usefulness of work to objective societal usefulness. The testable hypotheses one can derive from that mostly fall apart once tested.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09500170211015067

Also, really, just sit down and read his examples and think about them for a bit. It's a list of jobs Graeber doesn't like.

He cites actuaries as one example. That's the guy who tells you how expensive your car insurance is. Is that ""useless"" work? Maybe in a perfect world where nobody ever gets into an accident. In our world, risks happen and risk management is incredibly useful.

He cites bailiffs as another one. That's the guy who makes sure criminals can't just get up and run away in court.

He also cites programmers as one. Because bugs ""shouldn't happen"". Bugs are basically bound to happen once a program gets sufficiently complex, which in reality is a few dozen to a few hundred lines of code. You can't possibly cover every case, not to even mention that something like different hardware can lead to new bugs that make it impossible to fix everything preemptively without infinite time and a time machine.

All in all, of course bullshit jobs exist, but Graebers work in particular is scientifically unsound and it's unlikely the scale of the problem is nearly as big as described by him."

Quick Reminder to Not Give Away Your Salary Requirement in a Job Interview,"HR: What salary are you asking for this position?
ME: I really love the opportunity, and I'm confident if this is a good fit, the salary will be within range. 

HR: We need to put down a salary.
ME: What is the general range of salary for this position and level of responsibility?

It can go on and on. It is a dance. I usually ask on the first call from the headhunter / recruiter ""What is the general range of compensation for this position?"" . This is something they normally have in front of you, and the person cold calling is usually not the person who does the 'negotiation' to see your starting range. 

There have been a couple times the HR absolutely would not budge and required a number. I would simply say ""Between *75% of current pay* and *25% more than current pay* ,depending on the benefits and job responsibilities"". If you get backed into a corner, put a big range, and then later say ... the benefits aren't nearly good enough, and the responsibility is high enough that the low offer simply isn't an option.

"if 35-80% of US dollars were printed in 2020, why is inflation ‘only’ at 6.8%?","&gt;is that not what the fisher equation shows?

No. The fisher eq just states that real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation. The money supply isn't part of that at all.

&gt;but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation?

No. First of all, to state the obvious, there isn't.

Everything else being equal and all new money going towards consumption, this would be the case. But everything else *isn't* equal.

Monetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum, significant changes are usually a response to a change in economic conditions. In this case, the increase was so substantial to avoid the *deflation* that would have occured thanks to the economic shock by the pandemic. You had a fall in output, a fall in how quickly money changed hands, and in response an increase in the money supply.

Notable is also that behaviour in of itself matters. That's why central banks generally try to communicate their policy clearly and try to communicate policy changes ahead of time, so that expectations are in line with it. What people *believe* about inflation changes their actions and alters de facto inflation just as changes in the money supply do.

Ultimately in an economy you always have a mix of factors that push inflation up or down, the job of the central bank is to counteract these factors in order to reach their target of low and stable inflation. That's not always a perfect process, central bankers are neither wizards nor can they perfectly anticipate the future, but it does mean that ""why did the central bank alter the money supply"" is an important question to ask."

Wife got a job offer that feels like a scam,"This is 8000% a scam, and a very well-known one. Your wife will get a check and be told to cash it and then send $X to the ""printer company"" and keep the rest as her pay. There is no printer company. She is sending money to the scammer. The check will later bounce, and the bank will deduct the full $2950 from her account. She'll then be out the money that she sent for the ""printer,"" and possibly incur overdraft fees as well if it causes an overdraft.

The way this works is that the scammer uses a bad check, but that looks good enough to pass initial muster. It then gets credited to the account within X business days according to the bank's policy, but just because the money is available in your account doesn't mean a check has actually cleared. It takes a few weeks on the back end to make sure the check is legitimate and the account it's drawn on has sufficient funds to cover it, and once they realize it's no good they pull the money back from the account it was deposited in.

Tell her to run from this job, and she can report the person to the police if she wants to, though I doubt they'll actually catch them. In general, if it sounds too good to be true ($57/hour for making travel reservations from home is *way* too good to be true), it usually is."

How is Vienna So Successful Despite Extensive and Strict Rent Control?,"The short answer is that the Viennese government uses a combination of subsidy and direct government construction to get around any negative supply effects caused by rent control.\* The city itself is also in a lot of ways more free market than most US cities; single-family zoning doesn't exist in Vienna, comparatively around [75% of land zoned for housing in the US is zoned exclusively for single](https://www.planetizen.com/definition/single-family-zoning) family homes; [their building codes are also much more permissive](https://slate.com/business/2021/12/staircases-floor-plan-twitter-housing-apartments.html) and allow for cheaper construction than the US; they have much more streamlined building processes.

The other answer is that they do also have some of the negative characteristics associated with rent control. In particular, they have a two year residency requirement for social housing plus a waitlist. I don't have a source for typical wait times or for how easy it is to get a rental in the private market, though. It's certainly does not seem to be nearly as bad as it is in Sweeden or for trying to get into the US housing voucher system."

What are some of the investing lessons which you would like to share from your life?,"First of all upvote for finally some good conversation on this sub.

My two cents
I think one has to see what's the objective of investment. For example, I am not dependent on the investment income and share investment are for my retirement.

So I basically focus on a 10-20 year horizon. And a thumb rule which I work with is that profit or loss, I will go with booking it under Long term capital gain or loss. In years where I have only loss, I just carry it forward.

Found this is better than booking profit and paying 15% away as tax.

Obviously since I focus on long term I don't buy falling knives, and try to pick good stocks.

Made the ashok Leyland mistake too, but I held on and Brought some more during the pandemic lows. Plan to hold on for the next two cv cycles. It's slowly turning green lately.

Made another mistake in vedanta, bought it around 400s, shits burned a hole in my head. I will be booking my loss any time, just watching if the commodity cycle will turn up,will hold if it does and sell if it won't.

This kitty litter producer has seen a 99% increase in net income while the stock is down 21%,"Interesting company, if I was to invest, I'd seriously look into a few things from quickly going through their financials before I pull the trigger:

1. Why is the net margin so thin at 5%?  Is this a price competitive commodity industry with no moat?  Do people buy their products because of the brand and sticking to it, or do they go to the pet store and pick the cheapest on sale litter that day.  

2. Cashflow growth is at around 3.7% for past 5 years, this is low growth.  Which is fine, but the price needs to reflect the slow growth.  Is there any other future growth potentials from their 10-k?  

3. Yes, both cash and income shot up during pandemic, is this sustainable?  In past history their cashflow is slowly trending up with many spikes and drawdowns like this, I would look into those drawdown years and see what caused them.

So what are you looking for in a place? etc etc on and fucking on A) Let me have a look at this place and I'll tell you if it's one I want. 

Well we'd be happy to sell your current place for you A) Cool, I'll call you if that ever happens.

After they've spent the entire time trying to sell me their services rather than the house, on the way out they'll ask the standard 'So did you like place?' to which we answer 'it's not for us' regardless of how much we like it. Only once did I ask, because we really liked the place and were interested. So for a house listed as 'priced to sell' but sitting in the database at the 500-650 range I got this beauty

"If the market really is so fragile that just over half a million retards can bring the worlds economy to its knees by simply investing in a company they like then fuck it, it deserves to fail.","GG said during one of the hearings, and subsequent interviews, that social media (and specifically Reddit) is not behind any market manipulation anymore than CNBC is for touting specific stocks during their broadcasts.

&amp;#x200B;

""Market manipulation is defined by the intent to defraud people. If you tell your friends about an investment you like, that's not market manipulation.""

"Girlfriend applied for a job, within 24 hours they hired her, and sent her a check for $4,000 to buy supplies. Scam?","This is a common scam.

What will happen is that she will cash it and three days later the check will ""clear"". Your girlfriend will believe that the money is free to use and will send moneygrams or the like to the places her ""boss"" tells her to, while keeping the agreed upon fee for herself.

Sometime later the bank will let her know that the check was a fraud. See, when a check ""clears"" after three days, that doesn't mean it can't still turn out to be a fake check. But your girlfriend has already sent the money out and only has a small portion of it left. Now she will find herself in debt to the bank.

Don't cash the check. Discontinue contact with these scammers.

Edit: I wanted to clarify what ""clears"" means, since there a lot of questions on it. When I wrote that OP would have seen the check ""clear"", clear was in quotes because the assumption is that if the funds are available that the check has cleared, but that isn't true. So it hasn't actually cleared.

Banks will make funds available to you because there is both federal law the mandates this as well as a courtesy to you so you don't wait weeks for a check's funds to become available to you and upend your life, since most checks are not fraudulent and the money is needed.

Just because a check's funds have become available does NOT mean that the check has fully cleared the bank. Most people do not realize it and think a check has ""cleared"" after at most 3 days. Scammers know both when checks actually clear and what the popular public perception of when they clear is and they use that knowledge to prey upon people.

They also know to use out of state or even foreign bank accounts as the supposed ""source"" of the bad check they send you since they know that local banks that run through the local Federal Reserve will be able to actually clear and verify a check relatively quickly, but it takes longer for non local banks. Checks are sent to [clearinghouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_System) in order to be processed and are not cleared by one bank calling the other bank for every single check to see if it is valid. All of this is to say that a check goes through several steps that take time in order to figure out if it can actually be collected upon. 

Checks are vulnerable to this sort of fraud which is why the [Comptroller of the Currency](https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/get-answers/bank-accounts/forgery-and-fraud/faq-banking-fraud-01.html) says:

&gt; It's an example of why you should never accept a check from someone you don't know.

Checks are an exercise of trust between you and the person giving the check and between you and your bank. Unfortunately for you, your bank can unwind a bad check and take their money back. If you have already turned that bad check into cash and sent it off via irreversible means like Western Union or giftcards then you are left holding the bag and the scammer keeps your money.

And for those wondering what happens if you deposit the check and don't send anything to the scammer, well, the answer is only bad things. You don't keep any money (since there was no *real* money sent to you to begin with) and it is likely the bank will shut down your account for cashing fraudulent checks. They may also give you a black mark in the ChexSystems that banks use to vet customers before opening accounts for them. So you may find yourself hard pressed to be able to open a new bank account. So if you suspect that a check is a fraud, do NOT deposit it!"

What a difference dividends have made in my life.,"Wow congratulations! I also started getting into stocks last year too, my portfolio is a little over $11k right now, mostly dividend stocks with a few growth stocks. So basically $6k of my portfolio is towards dividends. So far generating $30-$60/mo, estimated a little over $500/year. Its always good to start when you know and learn as you go."
One million dollars for changing my last name,"Easy. Legally change your name. Tell no one except those in his social circle. Collect money. Change back legally after his inevitable death.

This is a tough one though. Being a financial subreddit, we should all say ""take the money,"" but whoring oneself out for a price usually never feels great. Just remember that it's not black and white. There is plenty of grey area, like my first section, even if it looks like a joke.

Edit: in theory you could change back as soon as you get the money and before his death, but I'd advise against potentially making enemies who are willing to drop $1MM on trivial details."
"META analysis PE less than 11. It’s a home run, convince me otherwise","The most common META-thesis rebuttals:

* Apple flips a couple of bytes in their privacy settings and facebook's business model is screwed.

* Whatsapp can't be aggressively monetized because chat platforms are a dime a dozen and survive by having the largest possible userbase. Monetizing whatsapp leads to people jumping to a less monetized or free alternative, taking their friends with them. You essentially can't earn big bucks from whatsapp.

* The metaverse is a smokescreen to divert attention away from the currently flailing advertising market position of Meta's biggest asset, facebook. It will fail because people fundamentally don't want it.

I do like instagram, I do agree that facebook generates boatloads of cashflow at the moment. But when the market sees no hope due to the above points, I just don't see the price coming back to $200+ regions. Somewhere around $180 would be possible imo, so in a sense I would say META's current price is closer to its bottom than it is to its top going forward."

The stock market is roughly at the same place it was pre-Covid. Isn't that a huge red flag?,"&gt;How is the stock market not reacting to this? Isn't this a sign that the stock market either was in a bubble previously, is in a bubble now,

The stock market has already priced in the crisis, and the stock market is about expectations about the future as well. This tells us at best that the expectation is that companies will survive and do just fine after the crisis is over.

&gt;or is being propped up by huge inflation that is right around the corner?

Joe bidens tax plan,"A detailed economic [analysis](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/9/14/biden-2020-analysis) of the Biden platform was done at the Wharton Business School (Trump's alma mater, ironically), which said the following:

&gt; Under the Biden tax plan, households with adjusted gross income (AGI) of $400,000 per year or less would not see their taxes increase directly but would see lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases. Those with AGI at or below $400,000 would see an average decrease in after-tax income of 0.9 percent under the Biden tax plan, compared to a decrease of 17.7 percent for those with AGI above $400,000 (the top 1.5 percent).

It also summarizes the general impact of the Biden platform, finding that it would result in a reduced debt and increased GDP growth relative to the status quo:

&gt; PWBM finds that over the 10-year budget window 2021 – 2030, the Biden platform would raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue and increase spending by $5.37 trillion. Including macroeconomic and health effects, by 2050 the Biden platform would decrease the federal debt by 6.1 percent and increase GDP by 0.8 percent relative to current law. Almost 80 percent of the increase in taxes under the Biden tax plan would fall on the top 1 percent of the income distribution.

In short, the Biden tax plan would result in slightly lower wages and returns on investment for those with incomes under $400,000, but would not directly increase their taxes. His platform would also reduce the national debt and boost GDP growth relative to Trump's policies. I hope that answers the question."
FIRE: I’m ready now at 49. But very difficult to walk away from strong salary and benefits. Concept of early retirement was much more intriguing at age 40. Am I alone in this?,"You have financial Independence.  You have fuck you money.  That doesn't mean you have to retire.  It just means you can if you want to.  And that ought to be a liberating feeling.  If your 400k salary and benefits are important to you and/or your legacy, keep getting them.  If you want to quit working completely, do it.  If you want to go clean cages at an animal shelter for minimum wage, you can do that too.  Or, you can take risks.  You can tell your boss no.  You can go home early from work and spend some time with your wife and kids.  You can take days off and go to little Suzy's piano recital or Timmy's baseball game.  You can take your wife to a cabin in the woods for a week and alternate between sitting in a wood fired hot tub and going at it like rabbits.  Maybe you will be ready to retire early next year instead.  But today you should enjoy life and enjoy all the hard work that it took to get to fuck you money status."
How Does an Economist Get Up-to-date News Without Going Insane?,"Professional economists typically try to stay up to date on economic literature in their respective fields by reading journals and do not watch the news.

Econ Twitter, when they’re not shitposting (which admittedly is most of the time) does occasionally add some value when they recommend or advertise prominent literature or debate methods. For me, it honestly helps me keep up to date with latest econometric methods because I don’t actively seek out reading that literature.

If his work is more focused on keeping up with recent trends in macro policy or global financial markets, without needing to go into the nitty gritty of academic literature, I would recommend the Economist over all of the other news sources."

What are some of the investing lessons which you would like to share from your life?,"I have seen a lot of my relatives buy a home. What I see is it often the budget overshoots by 10%. 

Folks will start with a budget and look for a home that costs that. (Some folks dont even consider the registration costs, but lets assume they do). There are MOTD costs, broker costs(if there is one), interior (painting/woodwork), fittings (new/replacement plumbing/electrical), housewarming, shifting - the list is long and subjective but usually adds up. 

So if your budget is 50L, look for a home that costs 45-46L. That is much less stressful than starting at 50L and ending up at 55L."

Why isn't Russia going bankrupt?,"Russia is semi self sufficient. They’re one of the worlds largest producers of both grain and energy. Food and fuel and state control of many industries means they can probably last longer than most countries would with their currency in the state it’s in. 

But the situation in the long and medium term for Russia is still very bleak. I cannot see any scenario where they achieve any measure of victory in Ukraine. Almost The entire world is United in opposition of their invasion, that some means the world won’t allow Ukraine to cease to exist (in the way say Poland was partitioned during WWII). And the strength the Ukrainian people have shown tells me that they will never surrender and never stop fighting now matter how long Russia remains there. 

Most data points to Russia not having the manpower to sustain an occupation of the country. Assuming that’s out the window, Russia can only try to achieve a decisive victory. They want to depose Zelenskyy. I think they’d like to have a pro Russian government installed but short of that I think Putin would settle for a Ukraine that is unstable and in a state of civil war/reconstruction with no economic, military, or otherwise capacity to join nato or the EU. 

Even if Russia achieves some measure of victory, they will only have achieved destroying themselves and Ukraine in the process. Their economy is gonna be fucked for a decade to come at least whether putin is still there or not in the years to come. There’s no way out of this for Russia short of them internally eliminating putin and pulling all forces from Ukraine immediately"

How have you spent money to optimize your well being / time along the journey to fatfire?,"I'm a therapist and my patients are mainly ""fatfire"" people. Them being patients, I obviously have the ultimate selection bias. Yet: What I find is that those who lean too much into this logic of optimization are the ones that suffer from a (literal) maddening degree of alienation.

It's an easy trap to fall into as it is so very *sensible*: Why would you spend six hours cleaning (doing a chore you hate and doing it badly) if you could just work an additional hour and outsource that? So you hire a cleaner. And a cook, a personal shopper, an interior designer and a nanny. But if you don't watch out, all your little self worth eggs, so to speak, are kept in the same work basket - and, step by step, you start to live the life of a stranger. You eat the food of someone else, wear the clothes of not-you, in an apartment that might as well be a hotel room, with kids that are more attached to their nanny than to you. Your vacations are glamorous, but there's little connection to anyone or anything in them. At this point you might start to feel a little unease. You might start to wonder why you're unfulfilled and try to treat yourself better - so you double down. You get a PA because dealing with a schedule is annoying, you get a personal trainer because *mens sana in corpore sano* and while you're at it, you also start therapy, where you learn techniques that help somewhat and where you analyze childhood events. But what somehow is kept at bay, in a fish-not-having-a-word-for-water-way, is that you identify with your job of optimizing processes to maximum efficency to a degree that you treat yourself like any work project. What I am getting at here is: Watch out. It may be easier and more worth it to develop an interest in cooking or join a sports club or a gym that you like. But also: Screw cleaning."

"Couples with large income disparities, has it stopped you from wanting to get married and/or share finances?","I (33 M) have always been the breadwinner compared to my now-wife (30 F), even when we were dating. 

When we met (25 and 22), I earned $130k and she earned $18k. I was earning $250k and she was earning $50k when we got married (29, 26). 

Now I earn $500k and she earns $0 as a stay at home mom. She has a bachelor’s degree from a top 30 school, is a great artist, phenomenal cook, amazing mother, and perfect wife. She works way harder than I do. 

Worked out for us. I never really cared. I’m very money driven, but when it came to selecting a partner, I just figured I was going to rely on myself financially and someone else for the other stuff. I don’t know why I compartmentalized it that way, but I did. And it worked for me. 

Many men face the same thing you’re struggling with. Interesting to read it from a female’s perspective. I don’t think there is a right or wrong. However, if you wanna be with this guy for the long haul, accept him with his financial situation. Seems like you’re 90% in and 10% out - and that 10% is important. If you can’t overcome the income disparity, maybe move on from him. The “live in my house but buy some groceries you poor schmuck” set up sounds odd for a couple."

Why not let the US rail strike play out? Wouldn't it help slow down the economy and help reduce inflation?,"It should be noted that a rail strike wouldn't necessarily reduce inflation, as it would slow down shipping for both intermediate products for production and final products to market. The former would impact production costs and increase prices as a result, whereas the latter would reduce market supply and increase prices as well. The result would most likely be higher prices for goods and an economic downturn as a result of businesses struggling to ship cross-country and consumers struggling to buy affected goods.

(I should note that threatening to strike is not necessarily a bad thing, and I support rail workers in their strike action should they choose to take it. Given the importance of rail infrastructure for cross-country shipping and given the threat that a work stoppage would pose for the economy, it should go without saying that the workers that operate that system should be taken seriously and given what are ultimately pretty small demands anyways, especially in the context of labour provisions provided in other OECD countries.)"
"Warning: AT&amp;T applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent","AT&amp;T charged my wife credit card without permission $400.

The customer support rep laughed and ensured me after the transaction the information was no longer needed and was gone. 3 months later we go to pay our bill and the customer rep said it had a $0 balance, I said why is that? My bill was $160 due or so we thought. Turned out after 3 hours on the phone, being passed around, AT&amp;T took it upon themselves to enlist me in Auto pay. I argued that I specifically requested to pay my bill in cash, every month and note my account to never enlist me in auto pay at the time of credit check, and every payment monthly. Then I argued how a monthly bill of $160.00 became $400.00, I was put on hold and hung up, I called back and the office had closed.

My net-worth is now 5 million dollars. It was 7000 three days ago.,"Not legal or financial advice, just an internet opinion. 

First off don’t start giving any away. You have a lot to manage and the fact you are posting about it with random internet strangers isn’t a good sign. Find out what bills need to be paid and start learning about real estate investing (because you suddenly are in that) and other types of investing and wealth preservation. If people call asking for money just give some throw away line like it is tied up in a transfer. 

Find out the tax implications of this ASAP, this will get taxed when you file next year, so be ready with cash for that. 

It sounds like up to this point you knew you wanted to build wealth but didn’t really know where to start. Now, I don’t have a complete picture of where you were, because a net worth of 7000 could be zero debt, zero assets, and 7000 cash in the bank or it could be a million in debt, and a million and 7000 in assets. Your worst enemy is your self. As you look for an adviser make sure they are a registered fiduciary."
Why is JPMorgan stockpiling cash if they expect inflation?,"Because inflation that is not transitory will be met with a response of tapering from the fed — when this happens and they increase interest rates, it will set off a chain reaction of events. 

The most important one(s) in the context of your question is it will make businesses harder to grow because of higher lending rates, and it will push much of the markets back into bonds.  You you could at that point (arguably) get a better rate of return on a fixed income (in theory, less risk) instrument rather than risk it in current markets. 

 This all means there will be a correction (who’s size is unknown but sounds like dimon is betting it will be on the big end), which is what he’s hoping for to put that extra cash to work"
I am a failed real estate investor. Here's what I learned.,I think it is the relationship between Property Manager and investor. Both have different goals and I believe an antagonistic relationship. PM makes money when investor is screwed. I have seen excitement only when there is repairs involved. I also feel a lot of PMs are in the property game. The better tenants with good scores and jobs do not even make it to you and will land with the PMs personal property. Not always the case but I think a possibility. Motto is to stay local if possible. Control is everything. Being able to drive and verify repairs and get multiple quotes is important.

A new milestone! 100k net worth,Congratulations on making it and realizing that you will likely bounce around that mark for a bit. I hit it in late 2019 and took a big paper hit from the COVID dip and am just now reaching that high water mark again.

In retrospect I would have been better off doubling down on investing but didn't have that certainty.
"34, making 35k a year 5k savings.. have I failed?","First off take a breather and actually give credit to yourself. You have a job that’s paying you. You have $5k in the savings, not a whole lot but it’s something. $35k is indeed low but in the meantime you can begin building your portfolio by investing into 401k if your employer offers it or having a Ira and contributing every pay check. Also try looking to find yourself a higher paying job. 

You asking this question about your financial well-being makes you smart and not a failure. Trust the process and believe in yourself. Takes time to build wealth"
Why do banks have anything less than 100% reserve requirements?,"In essence, reserve requirements are not going to be 100% for the same reason that we won’t require insurance companies to have a 100% reserve: the chances of a simultaneous withdrawal at 100% is almost infinitesimally small, and the chances of it happening across the whole financial system would imply we were on the verge of complete societal collapse already.

So what do we get from giving up the 100% reserve requirement? Now banks can do things with your money- they can offer loans (generally good for the economy that we have credit) and they are happy to hold your money for free.

What would happen if the reserve requirement was 100%? As banks can no longer loan out your money, they’d likely want to charge you (potentially exorbitant) fees to go through the process of holding and securing it. Loans would have to come entirely from financial capital already owned by lenders, which would massively reduce the supply of credit. 

All in all, the benefits outweigh the risks."

As a veteran investor,"That first quote was actually from the economist John Maynard Keynes. 

Buffet is a fucking hero, though. Some great quotes:

&gt;""Our favorite holding period is forever."" 

&gt;""What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know.""

&gt;""We have long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune-tellers look good.""

&gt;""You shouldn't own common stocks if a 50% decrease in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress.""

&gt; ""You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong."" 

The last one is actually one of my favourites. The most successful investors are typically not those who seek to add points to their portfolio, but rather those who seek to avoid losing points by managing risk. If you can make your investment strategy about not losing points, you will make longterm gains. "

Could the rise of 'work from home' cause more jobs to be off-shored to cheaper countries?,"I don't think the effect of the current crisis will be bigger than before. On one hand, yes, more companies should think about outsourcing workers, but what stopped them from doing that in 2019? Time zones, language barriers, and work culture. So while more companies will think about outsourcing, I doubt we will see a drastic shift. 

But what could happen is overall wage reduction for remote workers if they move out of the expensive areas like the Bay area into more rural lands. A lot of people would take that pay cut if rent was cheaper. 


And also lets not forget other issues with remote work that will force companies to call everyone back into the office when they can. Productivity and cooperation reduction is already noted in different sectors."

I hear a lot of liberal types say that economists fail to understand that people are…. people. That being said, a majority of my studies revolve around measuring/improving social welfare, and on the theory side, maximizing social welfare. Conversely, conservative types seem to get all of their economic ideologies from Micro 101. The problem with this, is the policies suggested in introductory courses are made under the assumption that the markets are perfectly competitive, which is not typically the case in the real world."

Living Off Dividends,"Our country has various benefits for why dividend investing should be a top priority for each Canadian. For example our dividend tax is 30% as opposed to Americans at 50% and companies that pay 4%+ dividends are usually one of very few in a controlled market. 

I pick what I believe to be the best company in each sector that shows growth of dividends, revenue, income, equity, over at least a 10 year timeframe. Why care about the latter 3 you may ask? Because of my goals!

My goals: 

1. Capital preservation - every investor should hold their first goal in investing as being able to preserve their original investment. By investing in only high dividend yielding stocks, you risk your actual equity side of the investment because usually these companies focused on solely dividends issue debt in order to keep paying them out to attract shareholders. A quick indicator of this is happening is to check the payout ratio (should be 50-70% for traditional companies).

2. Dividend income - obviously this is the another reason why you would be looking at building such a portfolio. Try to aim for 4%+ dividend yield! I wouldn’t exclude solid companies that can make your portfolio more defensive just cause they have low dividend yields, you can always balance it out if you are creative.

3. Capital appreciation - Not sure what planet some people may be coming from but it’s not a good look to have bought a stock 20 years ago and today it’s trading at the same price. They should be at least keep up with inflation (2%) otherwise your money is slowly getting burned. To determine how you can find a company with solid capital appreciation and solid dividends, just take a look at consistencies in revenue and income growth. 

The portfolio:

Fortis - 47 years of dividends  nuff said it’s literally a linear regression, if you are really picky buy when it taps the EMA on the monthly (hint: just did a few days ago). Pays 4% dividend and ppl need to pay their power bill it’s a century trade. 

TD - Guess what? We have some of the greatest financial institutions in the entire world based on regulation and accountability! imo this bank is the best in Canada going forward with the highest revenue, income growth in their industry whilst continuing to pay dividends. Kinda rare to see such massive growth for a Canadian company especially a bank but this is because they are focused on our neighbours down south! RBC is a close second but I like the colour green baby $$$. Pays 4% dividend

Enbridge - just lol. This industry was beaten to a pulp from our government and it isn’t a good look to be invested in. They pay a solid dividend at 6-7% and are throwing most of their remaining cash into projects that will create more renewable infrastructure. Their management doesn’t have to lie to their shareholders cause they aren’t directly in on oil so they can tell them, “look 2050 our revenue is gonna be nearly 100% renewable”. These guys are in it for the long hall - this I evaluate as my riskier bet but the high dividend yield will allow me to pick a super conservative stock that has low dividend (2%) to balance out back to our 4%.

CNR - speaking of conservative stocks we got CNR it’s I think the widest moat and hardest hurdle to jump into the ring with because who in their right mind is gonna put up $100B in CAPEX to build a railroad, plus jump through all the provincial legislation hoops, and all the aborigines treaties. Yeah not likely right? CP was the only other company I considered for this sector nothing wrong with that company but I needed a purely safe bet to balance out “risk on” bets so here we are. I think it pays 2% dividend

BAM.A - this is just a sexy stock honestly and it gives you exposure into real estate among various other businesses internationally without getting destroyed by crap management, large issuance of debt, and dividend baiting. This is the growthiest stock of them all and they also pay roughly 2% yield. 

BCE - high dividend at 6% yield, biggest telecom in Canada, 5G coming, tbh not really all that excited with where cable is going in the future so I may transition this into Telus because I see more growth through their wireless and teledoc initiatives.

Manulife - this is your unsexy boring insurance company stock but hey they got great constant growth over the years and pay a dividend that meets our goal of 4% so let’s pick it up

Algonquin - they got rekt from I think the texas power outage if I’m not mistaken recently? So good buying opportunity. Same sort of idea - high revenue growth, high dividend growth, only concern is the income growth this is I believe the lowest income generator based on market cap and revenue compared to the rest in the list. Also if you aren’t comfortable with so much overlap you already have fortis and BAM.A which owns BIP which owns utilities too. This you can leave out and toss more into fortis or Brookfield."
I made $10M in an IPO from a tech startup I worked at. What should I do now?,"Hey, I had a similar situation to you. Made 8 figures at the age of 27 from working at a successful startup. Lived in a $2k apartment and had a serious girlfriend at the time.

This windfall will change your life dramatically, in ways you can’t even imagine today. It has taken me years to get acclimated to a new lifestyle... one that is filled with different possibilities, different opportunities, different friendships, different power dynamics, different social influence, different lovers than ever before.

My advice to you would be to take it slowly. Don’t make any drastic decisions. You’re young, what’s the rush? To the best of your abilities, pretend like the money doesn’t exist for awhile. This will allow you to carefully navigate the transition and reflect at each step of the way — what kind of person do you want to be? Do you want to be a rich asshole or a kind, humble and caring? Do you want to buy a Ferrari or drive a Tesla Model 3? To be clear, these are rhetorical questions. What I’m saying is that you should critically analyze the choices you make at each step of the way, and think about what it means for the person you’re growing into. I believe this slow and steady introspection will lead you to the right path.

So why not keep working your current job for now? Why not stay at your current apartment for a little while?

For me, I kept my job and ended up finding deep fulfillment learning how to build effective teams and how to empower others. I stayed in my $2k apartment for a year or so, and then upgraded to a multi-million dollar house. I realized who my true friends really are. I found love. I constantly reflected on the person I was becoming, and found deeper purpose in life.

That’s what worked for me, anyways. Your mileage may vary. Congrats and good luck!"

"Why did Brazil fail economically, but China, Korea and Japan succeeded?","A failure to climb the value chain. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Rank_in_the_Economic_Complexity_Index%2C_OWID.svg) is a map of countries by economic complexity - the diversity of skills, knowledge, and productive capabilities in a country. From the [full list](https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/rankings), Japan is #1, South Korea #4, China #16, and Brazil #53, behind famously commodity-dependent Russia. Brazil's [top exports](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191541/products-exported-from-brazil/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Brazil%20most%20exported,U.S.%20dollars%20worth%20of%20exports.) are agricultural and raw materials, while China's [top exports](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/exports) are all manufactured goods. Contra popular belief, the bulk of these now adays are not labor intensive consumer products, but capital intensive and complex products: the top 5 are mechanical &amp; industrial products, machinery &amp; transport equipment, high tech products, automatic data processing equipment, and cell phones.

It should be noted as well that countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are the exception, where Brazil is the norm. Countless other promising economies like Turkey, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, and even India have been trapped in boom and bust cycles.

Understanding this requires an understanding of the different economic strategies employed. Until 1931, the economic reputation of Japan was the same as that of Brazil today: the country of the future... and always would be. It was fueled by exports of labor intensive industrial products, silk, and rayon. The barriers to entry in this business were low and a few large companies controlled the international distribution chain, just as a few large trading firms control the exports of Brazilian agricultural and mineral products today. The result was low profits and frequent market crashes whenever the international market worsened.

From 1931 to 1954, Japanese bureaucrats tested and perfected a strategy to climb the value chain and shift to more capital intensive industries with higher barriers to entry. It involved 1) limiting competition in low-barrier industries to increase the rate of profit, 2) channeling profits from low-barrier industries into ""strategic sectors"": the next rung on the value chain (i,e. textiles to steel, steel to machinery, machinery to consumer appliances, consumer appliances to automobiles), and 3) restricting foreign competition in strategic sectors until they could *outcompete* foreigners. This strategy was imitated by South Korea and later China.

It of course had downsides. For one, restricting competition in a low-barrier industry is tantamount to imposing a consumption tax on the public: they bear the burden of higher prices. Restricting imports also increases prices until local strategic sectors can mature. Finally, in the short-term, this policy defies comparative advantage: strategic sectors begin very inefficient. It only succeeded because, over time, the ""experience curve"" (brief summary of the concept [here](https://hbr.org/1985/03/building-strategy-on-the-experience-curve)) changes comparative advantages over time.

Understanding its advantages is less straightforward. As mentioned, industries up the value chain have higher barriers to entry, so they tend to also have higher margins, but not always. More importantly, compensation is better. Economic growth is highly counter-intuitive. Most people will interpret ""6% growth"" as ""the average person in country X is getting 6% richer a year"". In practice, it's more like 6% of the people have seen their incomes increase greatly this year, while most people's real incomes have barely changed. Assume you live in a town with a textile mill where most workers are being paid $15 an hour. A windshield glass factory opens next door and offers $30 and a sizable share of the town's incomes have doubled. The impression often given by economists is that the face of economic growth is that textile mill getting more and more efficient, when in practice it's that glass factory opening and doubling local wages. 

That glass factory starts with a far higher input cost than its competitors due to being on the left hand of the experience curve, but over time equalizes with them. In that time, it either requires huge amounts of capital to stay afloat, unnatural advantages like government subsidies, free land, or tax benefits, or both. Japan, South Korea, and China had their attention on building the glass factories and giving them that capital and those unnatural advantages: uncompetitive trade policies, free land harborside, infrastructural development meant to lower transportation costs specifically around a few industrial parks, hostile labor policy, and tax incentives (including tax deductions on buying their products) all but guaranteed those industries would be in the black from day 1, even if their methods were very inefficient. Then, when they became more efficient, they became dominant in export markets for a while, both because they still had *most* of these advantages (though would lose ""strategic sector"" privileges shortly after this point), and because wages hadn't caught up with the rest of the world.

As wages rose and certain industries stopped becoming profit leaders, *they* would then become the new ""textile industry"" and see competition limited and profits redirected to fund a new class of ""strategic sectors"". The state in Japan, China, and South Korea managed a never-ending cannibalism of industries to fund increasingly capital-intensive ones.

The growth model in boom and bust dependent ""failed miracle economies"" was very different. In Turkey and Brazil, just to give two examples, growth was typically driven by FDI. That FDI took advantage of relatively low wages, and, in some areas, relatively high levels of skill and education to create export-oriented businesses. Those businesses would then turn a profit for a while, but the influx of foreign capital into the country increased the value of the currency, and thereby decreased competitive of exports. Eventually, black balance sheets would go red and foreign investors would flee. These economies crashed into low wages and cheap currency again and once again became attractive to investors, so this cycle started over. All the while there were only very limited attempts to ""collect"" profits of industries further down the value chain and establish higher value chain industries: the only real initiative to do this were the establishment of a few public sector firms (on a much smaller order of magnitude than what was happening in East Asia) and periods of increased investment in education.

The difference between the rare miracle economies and the mass of disappointments came down to political incentives. Too often this is oversimplified to ""dictatorships focus on the long term while democracies focus on the short term"": this ignores the fact that most of the world's poor countries are dictatorships. Rather, we have to adopt a nuanced understanding of Northeast Asian governments during the boom years. They were not democracies where leaders are accountable to the public (even Japan is essentially a one party state), nor were they ""traditional"" autocracies where the leader is accountable to no one. Rather, for thousands of years, Confucian rulers have been accountable to *the palace*. The expectation has always been that the top leader is the public face of the regime but allows his ministers to govern autonomously, controlling only who gets promoted and fired. Whenever a leader - even an absolute monarch - lacks virtue or ability, there is a long tradition of his ministers either removing him or turning him into a puppet (we've seen this even in modern years with Jiang Zemin). The result in all the Asian miracle economies was an ""economic general staff"" that ran the country with 10 and 20 year timetables in mind, and that was relatively insulated from politics."

Biggest beefs with this:

1. MEDV has made public that they made $7.1 million in general public covid testing and $2 million in selling covid tests to a mining company in JANUARY ALONE. Which means they have realized over $9 million USD revenues in January - nearly 10x the OP's claim of $428k per month.



2. MEDV has NO WHERE NEAR 740 Testing Sites rolled out. In January they had 35 sites, selling over 70,000 tests at average $96 per test. Last we heard in February there was around 70, and most knowledgeable investors are hoping to see over 100 in March.

What do I (mid 20’s) and my parents (early 60’s) do to prepare for a market crash?,"Timing the market does not work. Period. Try it for yourself [here](https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/time-the-market-game/)

A beginner's guide to investing in the bond market (and debt mutual funds).,"This is a fantastic post, thank you for taking the time to write this down!

What is the difference between these perpetual bonds? Both of them can be written down, but while reviewing some mutual funds I got the impression it is more difficult to write down tier 2 bonds (ie tier 2 safe than at1). Is that correct?"
What would be the economical effects of raising everyone's salary to match inflation every year?,"This might sound great and fair, but it's very much doubtful this is a good idea.

First of all, this sets you right on track to a wage-price spiral. Inflation happens, which forces companies to raise wages, which leads to further inflation, until you end up in a situation where wages keeping up with inflation is the least of your problems. The currency goes down the drain, imports get super expensive, lending unreasonable, etc.

Second of all, wages are rigid downward. People don't like wage cuts, surprise. Inflation helps companies during downturns by lowering real wages, and helps them to avoid firing people or going under instead.

Third of all, what about dying industries? Eventually the revenue you generate falls below your wage, right now you'd still have the choice to accept a lower wage, if you couldn't cut wages, people would against just get fired.

Median real wage growth is usually positive, wages *do* keep up with inflation, just not always and not immediately."
People don't consider the psychological consequences of being poor,"When I was broke and had student loans over my head and credit card debt and made basically no money because I was in school and was only working part time money was an insane mental load.  I constantly worried about it.  Couldn't focus on anything else.  Once those went away it was like the clouds parted and clarity returned.  I had the mental energy to focus on other things besides how fucked I was because I had no money.  

I get it, and it really changes the way you utilize money and also how you care about yourself.  Once I was out of that hole suddenly I had the time and energy to give a shit about my health again.  When broke, a $1 box of candy was a cheap tasty thing that made me not feel like a sack of shit for a little while.  When out, I had the energy to say no to the box of candy because it'll be there later, I don't need it right now.  It's such a mind fuck.  I still battle with that mindset and have major anxiety that something will happen and I'll be right back in that hole again."

Am I just dumb or does Reddit really not understand how supply and demand with limited supply goods work (e.g. PS5)?,"Think of it this way, every individual who is able to purchase a console at the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), despite being willing to pay more, would experience an economic gain. Every additional dollar they have to pay to a scalper reduces their economic gain and increases the scalper's.

If you would pay $1,000 for a console, but are able to get it for only $500, that's an extra $500 in your pocket and possibly some intangible happiness. If you have to pay $1,000 for the console, you realize no gain. Even though the market as a whole might be functioning efficiently in the latter scenario where you pay $1k, a rational consumer would prefer the former where they realize a gain.

While the actions of the scalper might be rational, his profit is in some cases derived from the losses of people who would have otherwise been able to purchase the console at MSRP. While the scalpers don't affect total supply, they do affect demand, which can increase the market price.

I think what you have to understand is that while this does seem rational from the perspective of the free market in basic economics, the real world is composed of individuals who are subject individual gains and losses as well as location differences, search costs, and expectations.

Let's consider how some of these other things can affect individual opinions against the behaviors of a rational economic actor like a scalper:

1. Location Differences - While you're correct that the scalper's actions will not have any effect on overall supply, they can impact local supply and demand. When some profit-seeking individuals purchase large quantities of these consoles, they can reduce the quantity of consoles available in their local area, because the scalper might be able to make a greater profit selling it online to a different city or state. A Walmart in Giddings, Texas might receive a limited quantity of PS5s because of the relatively small population and median household income of [$44,000](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/giddingscitytexas/IPE120219v). A scalper who purchases all of their consoles and sells them to individuals in New York City with a median income of [$64,000](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork/IPE120219) might price them above what an individual in Giddings is able to pay. While it makes sense for the scalper from an economic perspective, individuals in certain locations might not appreciate being forced to compete with other areas earning higher median incomes.
2. Search Costs - Some consumers are not price sensitive, so the search costs for a console are minimal, because they're willing to pay the market price of a console on an auction site. For these consumers, scalpers can provide a valuable service by drastically reducing their cost (time spent) searching for a console.  
Other consumers who are price sensitive might only be willing to purchase a console if it's below a certain price. For them, the added demand from scalpers and potentially reduced local supply of consoles can increase their costs of searching for a console.
3. Expectations are an important part of economics that can influence opinion and behavior. In this case, people expect to be able to purchase a console at MSRP, and scalpers are economic agents who act explicitly for the purpose of selling consoles above MSRP. The actions of the scalper undermine peoples' expectations of what they feel is fair, which could explain the overwhelming negative response.

Even though the actions of the scalper are rational due to limited supply, some individuals bear the economic costs of their actions either through a higher purchase price, lack of a local supply, or increased search costs. Additionally, many people expect being able to purchase a console at MSRP, and might view the actions of the scalper as undermining their expectations.

*Edit: I focused my comment on why people might justifiably be angry at scalpers, but as* u/YaYaOnTour *correctly pointed out in their* [*comment*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/oenoun/am_i_just_dumb_or_does_reddit_really_not/h482so4)*, a more complete response should have mentioned that scalpers create a benefit for people who are willing to pay more for a console but unable to find one. I made that a bit clearer in the section on Search Costs.*"

£65k a year but living paycheck to paycheck. Any advice please?,"I was actually similar to you in my 20s, but earnt more and spent even more than you do. I’ve done a 180 now, which is evidence that you can, and will, change your ways.

The best advice I can give is to use standing orders, and multiple accounts.

1. Create a current account just for your salary. You never touch this one, and it doesn’t exist in your mind and it’s not ‘yours’ to spend. Never keep this card in your wallet, give it to your parents if need be.

2. Your second account should be something like starling / monzo / chase - set a weekly, not monthly, budget for all of your disposable expense. I have set this as £180per week. Create a weekly standing order to go from your salary account into ‘your’ which you can do whatever you want with. No limitations, go crazy, do whatever you want with this.

3. Create another current account for your bills that are not avoidable - such as mortgage, electric, council tax etc. Now set a standing order to go into this account. Never ever touch this account as if you do, you will get missed bills payments on your record and it will ruin you.

4. Create a savings account, such as chase, and again set a standing order for money to go into this account. You never touch this account, never keep the card onyou, give it to your parents.

After you mentally stop thinking that accounts 1, 2 and 4 are ‘your’ money, then the pattern of over spending stops. Weekly payments help hugely, as it’s easier to have a weekly allowance instead of monthly - because a month is a long time and in London you can spend all that money in a few days easily.

I don’t like ‘pots’ in current accounts, because it’s too easy to move money from them.

The above helped me enormously. If you saw the state of my spending before and now, it’s night and day. I’ve managed to save about £70k using the above, and I haven’t felt like I’ve missed out as I’ve always spent all the money in account 2 on whatever I want.

Standing orders are the answer! Good luck!"

This sub has become r/wsb but with ETFs,"Well, look it on the bright side, at least a lot of new people are going into investing. And in Europe, which is traditionally very non-investment friendly.

The Crypto / Esport / Clean Energy / Cannabis manias will all die down. Some people will get burned, it is inevitable. The ones holding ETFs much less so, as it is inherently less volatile than owning a random stock, even the ones that track volatile sectors.  


I know a thing or two about gambling (after 15 years in the Gambling Industry you would think so). People are going to do it no matter what. So best you can do if you have their best interests at heart is let them contain it to sums they can afford so they don't ruin them financially. I have the same philosophy with active speculation bets - I keep 5-10% of my portfolio for active bets (although it has fallen under 3% as I can't find anything attractive for me recently), and advise people with appetite for active bets to do the same."

The timeline aligns somewhat with mtgox, which collapsed in 2014 and stopped bitcoin withdraws sometime around then. If your brother filed a claim with mtgox when they entered bankruptcy, then there's a chance there's still ~$500k or more waiting to be distributed to his heirs. I would check the mtgox claims list (google it, or see r/mtgoxinsolvency) and see if you find his name on it."

Whole sector stinks."
What would happen if every person in the country was paid the exact same wage?,"Here are a few common problems people bring up about this kind of proposal:

1) Jobs that are more difficult, [more dangerous](https://advisorsmith.com/data/most-dangerous-jobs/), or just more unpleasant will not be filled now.  We call the difference in salary needed to get someone to do these jobs ""compensating wage differentials"".  Who would go down in the coal mines, fight in the army, work with toxic chemicals all day, or clean out the clogs in the sewer system?

2) What about people who start their own business?  Exact same wage implies that there will be no reward for doing this.  Who will work hard to invent better ways of doing things (or curing cancer)?  Again, with no reward system available, it isn't going to happen.

3) There is no incentive to **work hard**, either. With no way of getting raises, no way of getting a promotion, it is difficult to see why people would *work hard*.  Everyone might phone it in, all the time.  What are you going to do to me if I don't do any work at all?  I can always get another job making exactly the same thing. (This is the **opposite** of the ""efficiency wage"" idea, where you might pay someone more just for the fact that they will work harder to avoid losing the job.)

4) ""But human beings just love working, and will do all of these things anyway"", your girlfriend says. Sadly. most people do not agree.  I would be searching for the cushiest job I would enjoy the most (petting kittens, playing competitive video games whether I'm any good or not, be a member of a band), and will do the minimum I have to. 

5) What about jobs that require 6-10 years of schooling and training before you ever get paid?  Are we going to pay the students the same amount as well?  Then, I change my answer-- I will be a student for the rest of my life.  I will be really good at it though!

6) Think about this ""same wage"", what we will be paying a 16 year old kid. What about a single mother who has 5 kids?  What about a single father who went to Med school with 5 kids who is also responsible for taking care of his parents? You are going to limit him to the same salary, so that they now starve?

7) What about people who earn money on Patreon or similar platforms? What about people who are really good at earning tips because they do a great job?  Are we making laws preventing people from voluntarily giving other people money? 

8) Finally-- many people who make the ""same wage"" argument are also in favor of confiscating all the wealth, and dividing it equally among everyone.  What they fail to see is that within one month, some people will have spent or lost all of the money (we know what happens to many [lottery winners](https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/bankruptcy/lottery-winners-who-lost-millions/)), and people who are savvy/inventive/desire to save and invest/have that entrepreneurial bug in them will all of a sudden have a lot more.  ***How often are you proposing we reconfiscate and redistribute everything?***  Every night before bedtime?

As you can see, **really** trying to do this in the real world will have a lot of problems. And as you start creating exceptions for the issues I have raised above, or creating extra laws/rules saying that people **must work hard**, you quickly see that we are getting very far away from some utopian ideal.

Dividend paying ETFs &amp; individual stocks is the best strategy for me.,"@patsfan2019 quite an impressive portfolio! My father invested in the market and taught me to do the same. Born during the depression, he quit junior year of high school to help support his family when my grandfather suffered a stroke. Needless to say he worked blue collar jobs and long hours at that. He swore he would never be poor again. Understandably, my father was always a saver. He researched how to invest in the market and in the late 60s he started investing in stocks that paid dividends.  He didn’t make much money but he managed to save small amounts to invest. When he worked overtime or had extra cash he invested it and over the years continued to drip. Growing up we lived comfortably but not extravagantly. On top of an impressive portfolio my father built on his own research and knowledge, my parents managed to purchase 2 homes, pay for my entire education (masters in art education) as well as my brother (doctor of veterinary medicine). They were able to retire in their 50s and live off  SOME of the dividends while continuing to drip others. Neither had a job that paid a pension. My father started an IRA for him and my mother. My mom passed in 2008 (portfolio took a hit) but my father didn’t flinch as he survived many bear markets. My father passed December 2021 with the legacy of his impressive portfolio worth millions while accomplishing all he set out to achieve by saving and investing in dividend paying stocks which was the best strategy for him!  Keep up the great work!"

What will happen to economy with the rise in popularity of cryptocurrency?,"For a currency to be viable it need to be easily divisible, easily accessible and have a stable and recognize value.

I cannot buy food with bitcoin or any crypto. 

Cryptocurrency are volatile as hell.

USD is backed by taxpayers. I can buy grocery food with it and it's value even with inflation is more stable across time than the value of any cryptocurrency.

I can have access to USD for fairly small transaction cost. Bitcoin transaction are slow and costly.

The idea that cryptocurrency will overtake state currency is bollocks.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain as a technology might be use by states on state currency, but a currency not backed by any state will never be able to rivalize state currency.

At best, cryptocurrency is similar to gold to due scarcity. At worst, cryptocurrency isn't scarce because there's an infinite amount of cryptocurrency clones.

At best cryptocurrency have value through its security, but the retail investors don't need crypto security, they need need standard credit card security. At worst the security of crypto doesn't add any value and the value is only based on offer and demand and right now, people are buying crypto not for the technology, but for the get rich quick scheme so there's ''gamblers'' are going to sell to earn a profit. Same for those mining coins. When more people will sell than the liquidity available, the price will tank. It can take 2 weeks, 4 years, 10 years. This make the bitcoin unstable.

If you need to pay wage or if you need to buy anything, the USD will be more useful and convenient and stable than any cryptocurrency ever will.

The most likely outcome is not crypto overtaking USD. It's USD bank acount using crypto technology for transaction."

"How is it that people at /r/sweatystartup are earning an US middle class income, while people doing the same work in Bangladesh are earning below the international poverty line?","1) *Other* industries are more productive. Therefore  you have to pay these individuals more to guarantee their labor supply, or else they will exit for jobs in industries which have become more productive across time. (i.e., in the long run, opportunity cost is a constraint on labor supply) This is [Baumol's cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease).

2) In the same way, if you're in a more productive industry, your time is valuable, and so your willingness to pay to outsource household labor is also higher, and so prices for those services will rise. (That is, productivity increases in some sectors may shift around labor *demand* in others)

Rising general productivity in the US relative to Bangladesh is going to cause wages of all individuals to rise."

"Why do we have unemployment, rather than paying people to work?","I think unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are commonly misunderstood.

1. Unemployed people are not doing ""nothing""; they're looking for work. Benefits expire after a said period of time. UI benefits are meant to smooth consumption while you're looking for a job.
2. There's evidence that UI improves the quality of your search. People with benefits find jobs that they are better-qualified for, have higher wages, and/or longer tenure. This is good for the labor market because it means the right people are being matched with the right job, and increases what we call ""match quality"".
3. Human capital (like skills) are occupation specific i.e. people are good at what they do. There's a lot of research demonstrating that exogenous (as in random) occupation switches lead to long term loss in wage prospects and job quality. Forcing unemployed people to switch occupations/ learn something unrelated to their field when they could be spending their time and resources into finding a good job would lead to overall loss in productivity.
4. You only qualify for UI if you've been laid off due to no fault of your own. It could be the business was shutdown, there was a natural disaster, etc. It is unwarranted to ask these people to take up additional costs (which could be many and varied) to switch trades, even temporarily.

Hope that helps!"

I did some math for buying a house with cash vs buying it with loan.,"The calculations are a start, but you have made some implicit assumptions which may not be true. 
1. 6.5% housing loan you would get is most certainly a floating rate loan, so will not stay constant for next 20 years, given that the current interest rates are kept low due to Covid, the rate will inevitably go up in the future, might also cross the 8% pessimistinc estimate of Nifty return that you have. 
2. While Nifty may have 8~13% return rate when averaged over next 20 years, the individual years may have wildly varying returns... A series of negative return years, say -20%, -10%, -30% followed by some very good years might wreck your financial plan. You still will have to withdraw 15k per month to pay off your EMI. Sequence of returns is very important, more important than averaged returns over x years... 

Combine both scenarios and you are looking at more trouble. 

If you look at investing part of the portfolio in some debt instrument for ""safety""  then the averaged out return may not be enough to justify the time and  effort involved."
Why would poor people argue against minimum wage?,"Two mistakes you are making:

* First, some studies do find slightly lower employment but higher net income (as low-income employees have a higher job rotation). That means, on a micro scale, you may still be negatively affected. If you are happy at your job, and your employer says (s)he would fire you if the minimum wage is increased, this may lead you to be opposed to a hike - even if this is not true. Income isn't everything.

* Second, not every policy opinion is based on self-interest, which should be obvious. Your point would be equivalent to ''Why are some billionaires in favour of a wealth tax, or higher income taxes?''. I am not poor (nor rich), nor am I against a minimum wage hike. But you could be of the opinion that, if a worker thinks his/her wage is unfairly low,he/she should quit and find a better paying job. If he/she is unable to find a better paying job, he/she is responsible to improve themselves. Introducing a law would then simply be cheating.


I am not saying that this isn't mixed with misconceptions and misinformation. But even if you *do* know all the facts, you could still oppose a minimum wage hike. That you don't agree doesn't mean that their reasoning is not sound. Their reasons also do not have to be founded in economic theory. You can be morally in favour of an economically inefficient or counterproductive measure.

Edit: To be clear if I was supposed to take the anti-minwage stance and you would counter my lack of incentives argument with ''I didn't have much of answer for this other than what people do with their time is their own business'', I would find that a really poor counter."

What do economists know now that they didn't 50 years ago?,"Economics is *very* different than it was 50 years ago. Microeconomics, for instance, has undergone a drastic shift. Microeconomic theory in the 1970s was very much what you might call ""classical"" microeconomic theory- there was still a large focus on consumer and producer theory that underpins general equilibrium, and decision theory was still an active subfield. 

Since then, microeconomics evolved; many of the issues in decision theory were worked on and resolved (or at least resolved enough that economists figured further inquiry would be largely mathematical exercises of little real interest). Further, game theory rose to forefront of microeconomic theory and took over the field and has *almost* gotten to the point of exhausting it's traditional lines of inquiry (e.g. game theorists have moved away from a lot of traditional approaches to mechanism design to focus instead on more exotic approaches that yield ""worse case"" bounds or robust mechanisms; good examples of this would be the work of Bergemann or Brooks). Behavioral and Experimental economics (in many ways deeply related to microeconomic theory) became a field, and some of the results (such as Vernon Smith's stock market experiments with ASU undergrads) were deeply shocking to the field (among other things, this experiment exhibited evidence of bubbles arising even in relatively simple settings). 

Econometrics evolved as well. For one, in the most recent two or three decades, there's been an explosion of interest in causality on all levels. This means on a philosophical level, on an estimation level, on an implementation level, and in specific particularized applied problems. This has led to drastic advances in econometric methods, giving the applied researcher a very powerful toolbox as well as something of a guide to best practices in experimental implementation (thanks to the work of people like Duflo and Banerjee in doing so many experiments and learning the good practices the hard way). The combination of this interest in experiments, good guidelines, and strong tools for estimation has allowed us to answer questions we would have found impossible to answer before: what is the impact of UBI? Which aid programs to developing countries are most effective at increasing health outcomes? etc. Of course, as an econometrician, I find the theoretical advances that this has brought more interesting, but most people care less about that. Other things of note in econometrics are the rise and fall of a whole theoretical subfield, that of time series analysis (much like decision theory, there *was* a lot of productive work, but most of the questions have been exhausted). Whole nonparametric methods of estimation have come into style, gone out of style, and come back into style in the last 50 years- a good example would be neural networks, which actually saw pioneering work in the early 90s by an *econometrician* who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his many *other* contributions. 

Finally, macroeconomic theory is a very different beast than it was 50 years ago. Stagflation and the Lucas critique led to a drastic underlying shift in macroeconomic theory which pulled the field towards microfounded models beginning in the early 80s. While early microfounded models got a lot of well deserved flak, they eventually became an essential part of modern macroeconomic research, and in recent years, the most advanced of these models have become as good at forecasting as the traditional gold standard, VARs. Moving away from macroeconomic ""methods"" and more to macroeconomic ""facts"", many of the crises you mentioned have been taken in stride by macroeconomists in pursuit of understanding economic dynamics. There are certain macroeconomists who constantly emphasize the tightly related role that oil shocks seem to play in the business cycle (one prominent macroeconometrician in particular who emphasizes this that comes to mind is Jim Hamilton). The 2008 financial crisis spurred a whole host of literature on financial networks, systemic risk, and macroprudential policy; the low interest rate environment that results from the GFC spurred research into macroeconomic policy at the zero lower bound (when interest rates are nominally 0). The ""lost decade"" of Japan led to the now Nobel prize winning research of Ben Bernanke on interest rate targeting and forward guidance, research that would inform his actions during and after the GFC.

All this is to say that economics is a very large and very active field, and if you were a newly minted PhD student in 1972, there's a huge chance that much of what you learned as being the leading edge of economics would be seen as being so outdated as to not even justify inclusion (or inclusion to a significant degree) in the standard first year PhD sequence."

Why isn’t economics taught with calculus as a prerequisite?,"It depends on the country and the university. In the US, Intro Micro is usually taught without calculus, but Intermediate usually is with calculus (but certainly not always). In some engineering focused universities in the US (e.g. MIT) and most European ones (from what I have heard), they use calculus in intro micro. 

I am in the US, and in my intro classes that don't require calculus I briefly go through the idea of taking the derivative of a total revenue function to get marginal revenue, so they can see where the ""twice the slope is demand is linear"" rule comes from. Probably 80% of my students have seen calculus before they take it.

As to ""Why no calc?"", there are too many college degrees in the US that don't require any calculus classes at all, and many of those majors also require some kind of introductory economics course (e.g. some management degrees, political science, construction management)."
The Fed just pumped $1.5 trillion into the financial system. Where did the money come from?

6. Apply for [Medicaid/Healthcare](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/issue-briefs/health-care-foster/)
7. Apply for [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf)
8. Contact [211](http://211.org/). A free service by United Way
9. Declare her as a dependent on your taxes. [United Way](https://www.unitedway.org/myfreetaxes/) can help with that too
10. Find local non-profits, charities and churches. Reach out for help. Research organizations specific to your situation, one example I found from a quick google search is [Nation Association for Children of Alcoholics](http://nacoa.org/). I don't know anything about them specifically but you get the gist.

This isn't going to be easy, don't forget to take care of yourself too.
 
* Talk to your teachers and academic advisor, let them know what's going on and they can help make accommodations for you when necessary. If you don't, they're going to treat you like every other 20 year old without such huge responsibilities.
* Find a support network. Talk to a therapist if you have access to one through your school. Talk to single moms, and others in similar positions. 
* Lean on support where you can get it


As for your sibling

* Get them back into school
* Talk to their teachers 
* Get them free tutoring when possible
* Help them apply for FAFSA and scholarships their junior(?) year. They can probably go to college for free given their position as a foster kid as long as they graduate high school with a good/average GPA

You are doing a wonderful thing and I wish you and your sibling the best of luck.

Quick Reminder to Not Give Away Your Salary Requirement in a Job Interview,"This is another frustrating thing about those online form type applications. Many ask you to input a salary requirement and many of those won't let you input something like ""Negotiable"" as they only take hard numbers.

If you have to ask you can’t afford it,"A friend of mine once dated this college kid who was born into wealth. Parents gave the guy a AMEX black card. He went out to one of the fancier restaurants in town for a first date. He was trying to impress her, so he asked for the most expensive bottle of wine. The waiter warned him that it was expensive, but that it was currently on sale for ""half off"". The guy didn't ask for the price and just said bring it out. Turned out that it was a $30,000+ bottle of wine that was aged for a very long time. Even worse was that he later found the same year bottle of wine for way cheaper online. His parents took away his AMEX black card after that. The girl didn't even continue dating him after that. Moral of the story: If you don't ask the price, you might get ripped off even if you can afford it."

They CAN do a credit back to the card, don't let them say otherwise, BUT DO NOT MENTION ANY LAWYERS...the minute you do that, they have to refer you to legal and the conversation stops. 

ALSO, DO NOT CANCEL THE ACCOUNT UNTIL AFTER A REFUND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. If you do, it locks the CSR out of the account and you can't get anything back. You MIGHT be able to get a years worth of AOL refunded back to your card, but I wouldn't hope for much more.

My best friend committed suicide tonight because of his financial future with stocks.,"For anyone like u/h0ndaboy making light of this situation, perhaps out of callousness or an inability to relate, I'd love for you to read my favorite David Foster Wallace quote:

 “The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” "

Is Supply and Demand a law that is only valid within our current economic system or is it an actual natural law?,"What an interesting question! One way to look at the law of supply and demand is as a law about what the **optimal quantity** to be supplied based on the benefits to the supplier is. If the supplier produces more than that quantity, they will either have a surplus, meaning unnecessary costs, or reduced benefit, since it will have to discount the supply to get rid of all of it. If a supplier produces too little, they miss out on potential benefits.  
From the perspective of the consumer, if they consume below the optimal quantity, they're missing out on a trade that would make them better off. If they over consume, they have spent more resources than they like.

To see how this might play out in nature, consider a flowering tree and a bee. The bees are consumers, using energy to fly from flower to flower (price) in order to consume nectar from the flowers. The tree is the supplier, using energy to produce flowers, and gaining the benefit of pollination from the bees (price). If the tree produces too many flowers, the bees will only visit the easiest ones, so there is a surplus. The law of supply and demand doesn't say that the tree will produce the right number of flowers, or that the bee will visit the right number, just that there is an equilibrium value."
Following Biden's speech last night: What exactly does $6 trillion is deficient spending actually mean?,"The US mostly finances it's debt via bonds. So they sell bonds to literally the highest bidder, and pay them back once they reach maturity.

Who owns those bonds? Well, more or less anyone who wants can buy them, people, companies, foreign investors, etc.

That said, most of this debt is held by the American public.

https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124

How is it paid? Well, you have to keep in mind that this isn't one big loan, it's hundreds of thousands of bonds. It's not paid back all at once, either. The cost of the debt isn't really the 28 trillion, it's what it costs to service that debt.

And it's paid by mostly tax dollars. Current tax dollars and future tax dollars. And especially with things like infrastructure investments, what matters is how much you get in return, meaning how much you invest into the economy and how much economic growth you get for that.

In that regard, the US has a pretty good track record. Because debt is generally cheap for the US, because it's literally the most reliable debtor there is, so rates are low, and because returns are good, leading to a cost that's ultimately the vast majority of the time either negative or slightly positive.

Why does the economy run paycheck-to-paycheck?,"It's important to remember the difference between liquidity and solvency. It's not that companies are at risk of going bankrupt due to bad managment, its a sudden demand shock thats hurting them. They just need cash to hold them over until things normalise.

So that leads to the question; why don't companies keep rainy day funds? 

Now a lot of people on reddit will start harping on about stock buy-backs and corperate evil and stuff like that, but it's actually a lot simpler. 

Leaving cash sitting around in a bank account waiting for a rainy day is a bad investment, like an awful investment. Say you run a cafe, any extra cash you have lying around can probably be invested back into you business, buy a better coffee machine, upgrade your kitchen, ect. Now for a cafe there's only so many things you can spend your money on, but for a massive international firm there are always ways to invest that money. And if you as a company don't have anything good to invest in then you can pay money to your shareholders and let them invest in new things. Money sitting in a bank account isn't doing anyone any good, if we did what some morons on latestagecapialism are suggesting and made companies have rainy day funds that would tie up billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars in the economy (and fuck with interest rates)."

2. You cannot practice in the military. You must be a graduate of a US/Puerto Rican MD/DO program in order to become a military physician without being licensed already. In addition, there is a highly competitive military match that mirror the civilian match -- and you cannot go into this match unless you are already a member of the military through HPSP or USU. It *may* be possible for you to look a the Fee Assistance Program after an internship, but this would be better discussed with a military medicine recruiter.
3. The Public Loan Forgiveness Program might not be for you. Make sure you read about the [eligibility](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#eligible-loans) before pursuing this. In addition, it's probably not the right time to think about this as your #1 priority should be getting your post-graduate training(residency.)

So I can't speak too much to the financial aspect, but may by able to provide some advice regarding your career. If I were in your situation, this is what I would do:

1. Don't worry about matching into a residency so much as matching into an internship. You should be applying to every preliminary medicine program you can afford to. You are unlikely to match into a categorical internship without making some sort of drastic change to your application. Getting an internship sets you up to be able to practice in a limited setting as well as gives you an opportunity to ""prove yourself"" and become more competitive for residencies. It also gives you a year of income.

2. Bolster your application. It is very, very easy to get publishable case reports. Almost every doctor has a pile of cases they've been meaning to write up and will likely never get around to. Contact some of your faculty from medical school and see if they have anything available. Even if you don't publish, getting abstracts accepted(or even presented) at conferences will go a long way. Case reports do not take a lot of effort but can be high yield.

3. Get to know Program Directors, if possible. If you live in an area with a preliminary medicine program, it may be a good idea to get some face time with the PD there. I know of several people who were sub-par applicants who got in the good graces of PDs and were selected come match day.

4. Apply broadly. Look at programs and specialties that did not fill last year and shoot for those. You are not in a position to be picky, so things like location and prestige of the program should not be priorities. Just getting into *any* program should be your hope.

5. If you don't match, continue to look for job listings throughout the year. *Tons* of interns drop out or transfer throughout the year. Many of these positions go unfilled. A lot of programs post openings for these throughout the year, fully expecting that their selection pool will be from unmatched grads looking for a spot. These are opportunities for you.

Good luck, hope this helps.

I bought an Australian airline in January 2020. Bought it for less than the value of their fleet of planes, which they owned outright. Country airline that just did regional routes. COVID hits, down 60%. I look at it again and reason that they can survive this easily with their balance sheet. I wait. Virgin Australia collapses. A couple of months later they announce that they are a) starting routes in our ""golden triangle"" (SYD, MLB, BNE), and b) selling and leasing back their fleet. Sold weeks later for a 150% profit on original price.

When I told people I was buying a small regional airline back in January 2020 they looked at me like I just strangled a puppy  - but all I did was buy $1 bills for 60 cents and sold them for $1.20 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

Could/would Goldfinger's plan have succeeded?,"So I'm not an economist, but I am a chemist. A dirty bomb works by scattering radioactive dust in the area of the explosion, so there's little bits of radioactive uranium causing the health hazard. It's possible to remove the dust, so after a thorough clean the gold would be fine. If the uranium caused some of the outermost layer of gold to become radioactive, it would form an isotope of gold, which would then undergo decay into regular gold and helium in a pretty short amount of time, seconds to days depending on the particular isotope formed."
"If rent control is unintentionally counterproductive, how can we keep rent from rising faster than people's wages?","Increase supply. 

There are a bunch of factors that limit supply. Building codes. City Ordinances. Tax incentives. Labor costs. All of those trade offs effect supply. 

For example: You have a high rise building in Manhattan with a beautiful view of central park. The building in front of it wants to add another hundred floors, obscuring the view. What do you do? You try to block the construction via the city. That limits supply, that drives up rents."

Stigma attached to stock market in uk.,"&gt; 5 years ago i received a £75,000 inheritence and was advised by my peers who i trusted it would be safer in the bank. Looking back in hindsight that was a massive mistake.

Don't confuse safety with risk related returns.

Putting money in the bank is still the safer option, regardless what the stock market does in 5 years. We just happened to have a scenario where it went up. There would have been potential scenarios where it went down.

Safety is about wealth preservation.

Investing in the stock market is about growing your wealth (but you can also lose it).

Don't kid yourself that just because the stock market went up over the last 5 years instead of down, that it is now ""safer"" than a bank deposit."
Why I gave up on active stock picking and sold every individual stock I own,Active portfolio management is a full time job and the guilt that comes from under performing the benchmark even by just 0.1% is much more than the satisfaction that comes from beating the benchmark by even 1% considering the kind of efforts involved if you're serious about stock picking.

Is it wrong to assume that Canada's economy will become slow in future years because of the housing costs?,"Absolutely, and for more reasons than just that:

- When homeowners earn more from their house than their job, that job seems less worthy of their valuable time

- When it's become more attractive to go into real estate than, say, engineering or entrepreneurship, you can expect fewer engineers and entrepreneurs, and those entrepreneurs that remain will be running startups in the real estate industry (ie, Key Living Corp)

- And as long as the bubble continues, expect it to soak up more investment capital like a black hole, resulting in less investment available to productive endeavours or disruptive innovations

- It will also get more expensive to run businesses, as more and more of your revenue gets allocated to the ground under your factory and the ground under your workers' beds

- When it's more expensive to start a family, expect fewer children

- If the bubble truly never pops, expect immigration to eventually slow down too, as Canada becomes more expensive and less attractive

- And if it does pop, well, the picture might get a lot brighter, but only after a period of deep darkness as our mistakes catch up to us"
I'm pretty sure private health insurance is a scam,"I wonder what the cost comparison would look like on self-insuring for the private system.

In an emergency situation, the public system (as I understand it) provides better care than the private system. So that is a no-brainer.

Then people talk about how they might have to wait 2-3 years for a knee or hip replacement in the public system. But what about accessing the private system without insurance? Would it cost $10k? Or $50k? (I actually have no idea). Would it be reasonable to bank the insurance money and be prepared to stump up for a private procedure if the public wait is too long?

EDIT - As this is a high-interest post.

Others below have commented that certain medical professionals might refuse to consult or treat you if you are not an insured patient. My initial thought that perhaps you could simply ""self-insure"" is not a good solution if you cannot reach into your own pocket to see a private doctor."

"[Serious] Economists of Reddit: If over 80% of the US dollar has been printed in the 3 years, why is the value of the dollar not a fifth of what it was 3 years ago?","This is probably because you have seen this [graph of M1 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) from the Fed.

The problem with that graph is that the Fed changed their definitions! Notice the rather complex speil about ""Before May 2020"" and ""After May 2020"". Basically, in May 2020 the Fed decided to include savings accounts in M1 money supply. That caused a lot of unnecessary confusion and was a bad idea in my view.

If you look at M2 money supply you will see that that metric has risen by 40% since the COVID pandemic started. So, it is not surprising that we have high inflation. In recent months money supply has been falling slightly."

Don't be afraid of challenging that assumption. Keep your resume polished, and interview for better jobs than yours semi-regularly. If your skills are in demand, you may be surprised by the offers you get. If they're not, that's something to work on.

Don't bother trying to juggle multiple jobs. Your main income is going to be your one good job until you accumulate investments.  
It's okay to have side projects though, this is how you can close the gap on some of those in-demand skills, and who knows, some of those projects may turn out to be monetizable. Or they may help your resume look more attractive.

Learn how to write a business plan. Come up with fake businesses, or pretend you're writing a business plan for an already existing business in your area.

Once you've learned how to do that, take the skills you learned writing a business plan, and apply it to your personal life.

What are your values, your mission, goals.. how are you going to achieve those goals? What obstacles might you run into? How are you going to overcome those obstacles? What is the timeline for achieving each goal? And everything else put into a business plan can be applied to your own personal mission, as if you are the business."

Where are all the non-rich people?,"We exist (1200€ netto about 1/3 of the average in DE), but we post less because there's less to be managed when you have little left over.

Every subreddit has a demographics distribution.. and for diverse reason be it education, language knowledge, job field, well you kinda self selected yourself here simply by knowing English, which already separates you from the majority of probably poorer ""single language"" Europeans that exist.

Think about it, if you already know English, and care about your finances enough to read about it, how likely is it that you remain poor (at least relative to your own country's standard)"
If corporate profits are at a all time high. Than why is the stock market plunging?,"Markets are forward looking. Investors and speculators see that things will be worse in the future. That affects corporate profits now.

Remember that companies borrow a lot. They also often borrow at variable interest rates. As a result, their borrowing cost will rise significantly. Bank borrow and lend. In the US however, they usually lend at fixed interest rates for home loans. So, the mortgage payments banks are getting are falling in value due to inflation, but banks can't compensate by increasing interest rates.

Then there's leverage. Many investors use leverage to obtain higher returns. Those loans are also variable rate. They have become sharply more expensive because of the Fed interest rate rises.

Lastly, there's bonds which are an alternative to shares. The rate rises have made bonds much more attractive. 15 year US government bonds yield nearly 4%. Compare that to the shares of a company that gives no growth, those may also yield 4%. So, why buy a share - which comes with risk - when you can buy the bond?"

"Google has blocked auto-complete of the word 'perjury' with 'Ken Griffin' - I don't care how much money you pay a search engine company, this shouldn't happen. We are not China.","Don't forget Apple deleted RH reviews.

Why are so many Americans living above their means?,"I think a lot of it is not just financing (cars and houses bought on credit incuring interest) but just the way that monthly payments are the norm. I feel like I live in a bubble from reading a lot of financial planning subreddits and blogs, so I'm always surprised to see furniture and cell phones bought on a monthly payment (whether financed or not). Best example I have is my partner went to buy an apple watch and asked the price and it was like ""$30"". She said no, like the price to buy it, not to pay monthly. The employee had to go look it up. I was blown away. Is it really that rare that you buy something at cost anymore?  I get it, if it's not financed what's the problem?  For me, the problem is shitty cash flow every month because you're tied up in monthly costs. And if your income changes, you're not done with those transactions, you owe on them for years (usually). I'll never go back to that.

TLDR:  I feel like everyone is tricked into believing they can afford it if it's broken into cost per month."

"Would a group of new grads who just graduated from college with Bachelor's degrees in Economics do a fairly good job at running the Federal Reserve, or would they most likely lead the country to economic ruin given the amount of knowledge that their degree has taught them?","The Fed is supported by about 300 PhD economists. A PhD in economics is typically an additional five years of training beyond undergrad. Within the Fed, there are a bunch of more senior positions that are pretty much strictly for established economists (so at least ten years post PhD). A position as an economist at the Fed usually requires the accumulation of at least 15 years of bachelors training. Beyond that, the Fed employees a number of lawyers who ensure that the actions the Fed takes are legal and a number of bankers who I honestly don't know what they do, but presumably it's important. So it's not just the economics that the Fed requires, but all the legal and institutional knowledge as well.

A lot of the difference is that a PhD is substantially more thorough and rigorous than an undergraduate degree. As for on the job training, maybe someone who is a mid career PhD economist can chime in.

So yes, it would be very bad for the economy if the Fed was run by people straight out of undergrad,"

"When the stock market crashed in 2000, it took 12 years for the S&amp;P index to recover its losses and yet the cash dividends from one's running balance in the S&amp;P index grew by 359% (not by 0%) from 1999-2012. Why weren't dividends affected?","The crash in that period was entirely driven by runaway valuations and expectations about how the internet would revolutionize businesses. A company’s stock price doesn’t impact operations on a daily basis. It doesn’t matter to Apple if their stock trades at $50 or $500. They have enough cash and cash flow to continue business as usual. Most established companies operated the exact same way before and after the crash. The only thing that changed was their stock price. Since dividends are a function of how much cash the company can generate, dividends weren’t hit by the crash."
Can anyone see the future?,"My thinking:

I genuinely don't know about a crash, it could go either way.

But I do think this is the start of a significant increase in the cost of living, disruption and inequality. 

I actually suspect that the '08 crash was just the beginning, it started QE and turbocharged a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. I think a lot of what drove Brexit, Trump and a general appetite for authoritarian leaders was a subtle but huge reduction in the quality of life for everyday people.

Gone are the days of one income supporting a family, a house and two cars. Gone are affordable degrees that lead to well paying jobs. Gone are the opportunities to better yourself and climb up the ladder, everyone can see that hard work will get you nowhere. Inherited wealth is the only thing that'll significantly improve your finances. 

I think that the subtle and complex economic machinations that caused this are too vague and too boring for the general public to get angry about, instead it's blamed on skapegoats. 

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing 2021 to 2008, I think The UK has much more destructive QE, inflation, disruptions to supply chains, weaker politicians who just want to pillage what they can and economic crisis at several points in the world (not just American mortgages this time). 

The dark comfort I take in this is, just like in '08, some people can make money off it. If you've got a stable income and you already own property and assets, you'll weather things much better than others. You can even scoop up assets at a discount and watch your debts inflate away. 

I'm doing my very best to be on the right side of this shift. Cash is trash, buying assets with debt is great. I've got a stable job with private healthcare, a hybrid car I own outright, a mortgage with an interest rate well below inflation, and a good amount of equities and crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like where the government and the country is headed, it really doesn't align with my values and how I want things to be done. But I can't change that, so I'm gonna make sure I'm not on the losing side. It's dark and it's bleak, but it's my life and I'm gonna look after myself."

Finally free from the chains of being an employee - Devoting next chapter to pro bono,"Wow ggwp.

I am in consultancy business, own a boutique consultancy firm. 

About ten years ago, a famous well known NGO approached me for a quote for a critical piece of work for them.

Unknown to them, they are my favourite charity. I have a monthly direct debit donating to their cause. But business is business.

I spent couple of days examining their case and gave them my standard quote.

They came back and said that out of all the proposals they got, they liked mine but they couldn't afford my price.

To be honest, I had already given them a discount in my quote as they are my favourite charity.

I asked them for a budget and I just can't do it. The profit margin would be too small and I would have other opportunity cost. In the end, I told them to find someone else.

A few years later, I had the chance to interview someone for a position. He had it in his CV that he was the lead on this project.

I called him in for an interview. From the conversation, I can tell that he did the project and he was shit. Didn't pass my technical interview. I checked in on my contact at the NGO. They told me that they went with a small outfit and the project failed.

I was totally gutted. To be honest with you guys, I felt like a looser. All those money that I donated to them is a drop in the ocean compared to what they had lost.

I will be fatfire in a few years. My plan is that I will take a volunteer position within that NGO or whichever NGO that will take me and make it right.

How Does an Economist Get Up-to-date News Without Going Insane?,"I was mostly in the IR world, but there are a lot of similarities in news cycles. Regardless, even the best newspapers have bias. Its important to be familiar with the subject, you will know when to apply salt accordingly. The NYT opinion section has Krugman and WP has wonks like Drezner. Both sections also have a ton of filler shit articles as well.

Economist: Probably more geopolitics than Economics ironically, but magazines-due to having to cover a wider period- often have longer articles and tend to be better researched. They often do reviews or talk about topics du jour that you can explore further: piketty appeared a bunch when Capital came out. 

Policy Wonk sites: If you are familiar with the subject, you'll be able to detect someone's bias by their argument/ who they cite. Some sites are more casual opinion, warontherocks and warisboring for Nat Sec. Others are focused on Industry news, such as Defense one. Use salt accordingly. I'm not as familiar with which ones are the economics equivalent. Try googling scholars you respect, they'll often post to these sites as well.

The actual source: If you are interested in legislation or enacted policy, bills are available online and the Federal Register is the official mouthpiece of all government organizations policy-wise. The Fed also has a ton of cool graphs/info.

Finally, the daily news cycle is oppressive in how much comes out a day. Rarely does one require minute-by-minute knowledge, since 24 news channels are just trying to fill up time on slow days. No one wants to watch ""boring day in NYC"". Clicks tend to be garnered from disasters that don't affect them, like miners trapped in cave in or ""disaster occurs in area we would never cover on a busy day"". A lot of signal is lost in the noise. Longer form journalism, even weekly magazines, tend to go more in depth and are better at identifying important aspects."

So really no one wins but the agent. all i can suggest is you stick to your guns and offer what you think the property is worth.

How to invest 100.000 €?,"* Firstly, do not seek or trust anyone on the internet that offers financial advise. **Always do your research.**

Some ideas:

* **Emergency fund**: Make sure to build an emergency fund to be able to cover emergency expenses. This fund should be able to cover 4-5 months of expenses in case something unexpected happens (e.g. broken car, emergency not-covered medical expense, hospitalisation of a family member abroad that might need financial support etc). After doing so, think what to do the rest money.
* **Family**. You said you want to adopt a child. This is so amazing but you need to do your budjet estimation because a kid has a lot of expenses. might be a good idea to put some cash at the side for this goal if it is a short-term goal.
* **Plan ahead**. Then, if you don’t have short term projects (e.g. buying a car, spending big on something, etc) that require cash, you can think about investing into stocks, ETFs etc. I understand that you have 25k saved already and **plan** to save in the next 5 years.
* **Define an investing goal.** Depending on your goal and time horizon you can decide where to invest. What if you goal? To increase your capital in order to buy your home? VWCE is great for long term but if you seek short term gains then other assets or ETFs can be more appropriate.
* **ETF choice**. Concerning ETFs, VWCE is a nice, not so risky ETF that contains stocks and many people including myself invest in it. And remember, always invest money that you don’t need in the short term. Also, justetf.com is great for ETF research.
* **Broker**. As a broker, Degiro and IBKR are the most popular in Europe. I use degiro because of its low fees in nice ETFs like VWCE, IWDA, VUAA. Edit: people say below that in Germany there are also others. Do your research and find a low fee broker.
* **Optimize taxes**. Concerning capital gain taxes I have no idea so speak with a financial advisor in Germany. Maybe an accumulating ETF is advantageous in your case. Or maybe not."

Why do politicians and economists claim new construction is important for the housing industry (eg. to lower prices) when there is already a large number of (even vacant) houses?,"Because the general idea is that where demand is is not the same place that supply is. There is a lot of demand for housing in urban areas, hence they tend to be significantly expensive.  But it’s the opposite effect in rural areas where there is low demand. So, by building more housing in urban areas we can shift the demand supply left so the end result is cheaper housing."
Why don’t we just let major airlines collapse?,"I work for a major US carrier. Our CEO just sent out an email trying to reassure us that we can weather this storm. We apparently have $1.5 billion in cash on hand. That seems like a lot, but operating an airline is expensive.

We net less than $2000 in profit from an average 737 flight in years that aren't very turbulent (pardon the pun), and right now we're seeing flights go out with sometimes fewer than 10 people on them. This is the lead-in to spring break when we're supposed to have packed flights.

The issue is we don't know how long this is going to last, and we don't know how severe the drop in demand will be.

People don't consider the psychological consequences of being poor,"&gt;Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less. For a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral. **Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal**. He should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation."
€1 houses in Italy,"There is no point in listing the benefits and drawbacks of this investment as it is not an investment in the first place.

The idea behind it is to revive old communities that do not have enough of a populace left to sustain themselves much longer. As such, if you would move in, do the necessary renovations, and most importantly, live there permanently and integrate yourself in the local community, the community will provide you the lot and house for a symbolic euro.

They don't just give it to anyone, it is a whole process, and they specifically aren't looking for fixer uppers, airbnbs, or people looking for a second residence as in your case. If that would be the case, there would have been a myriad of developers and rich people all over the world already who would have jumped at the opportunity and bought everything up already.

Your health is your most valuable investment.,"Could not agree more. This is something I do not understand when people skip out on. Good quality, enjoyable food and drink, as well as good health are of paramount importance for a good quality of life. You should not go cheap on that. That is the core investment by itself, because without it, what is everything else worth?

Importantly, eating healthy is also not necessarily more expensive. Eating out is expensive, eating super processed foods is expensive. Eating out I can understand for the experience and socializing, but the processed foods are dead to me. Just skip out on the all the processed bullshit and super sugary stuff (sugar is way more screwed up than fat) and get started on a balanced diet. By balanced diet, I mean eat everything. Unless you have a very specific goal and know what you are doing, following a restrictive diet is almost always an expensive mistake.

Eat what you love every day, but keep switching it up. Cook using basic ingredients and make something awesome; cooking is the most rewarding hobby. Treat yourself and have a glass of wine or drink every day. You don't have to buy organic, it is an unsustainable scam for the most part anyway. Try to buy local instead. If you're vegetarian or vegan, the processed foods are crazy expensive and not very healthy, so try to avoid them -- have them for convenience only. If you're a meat eater, buying ground meat in bulk and putting it portioned in the freezer is cheap and goes a long way. In any case, eating fresh beats eating processed all day every day.

Exercise your body and get into fitness. Don't aim for Arnold, aim to be able to run a couple of km/miles and lift weights on an intermediate level and do it twice a week. You will feel so much healthier and it will also help you clear your mind. A decent pair of running shoes and gym pass for a year will cost you but a couple of shares of VT a year."

"Why is Airbnb frequently blamed for making city centres unaffordable to live in, but other tourist infrastructure isn't?","Hotels are more controlled than Airbnb. Depending on the city, you either need to buy land zoned for that purpose, or obtain specific permission to build a hotel, or both. Tourism will still compete with residential for land use, but it can’t compete freely, so cities have more tools manage the trade-off between tourism jobs and increased rents.

Airbnb, by contrast, allows landlords to freely convert residential property into tourism accommodation (at least initially, some places have legislated to stop this), so they can arbitrage between tourism &amp; residential, which would cause a convergence in prices.

This does seem to be supported by empirical evidence - a number of studies have shown a link between volume of airbnb listings &amp; rising rents in particular neighbourhoods.

I just found out the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. WTF!?,"OP, you're getting trashed in the comments because you have a fundamental misunderstanding of economics.  Your level of knowledge seems to amount to ""big numbers are scary.""  It's hard to argue with someone who lacks so many fundamental, basement-level facts.

For starters, you're trying to interpret the nations economy through the only economic lens you're familiar with, your own household budget.  And that's absolutely wrong.  For you, money can only be spent if it can be earned.  For you, every dollar you become indebted, you must eventually pay back.  For you, money is a tangible asset, a store of value, which you must trade something else of value for -- your labor, your property, your skill, etc.  None of this is true for a government like the United States.

The US government issues its own currency.  It also spends solely in that currency.  Can you create your own warren-bucks on demand?  Can you buy real goods and services with them?  Can you pay down your debts?  No.  But the US government can.  Why?  Because of taxes.  If the government stopped collecting taxes tomorrow, the value of the dollar would evaporate.  It's taxes, which can *only* be paid in USD, which gives the dollar its inherent value.  There exists in this country a debt which *every person must pay* and which can *only be satisfied* with USD, otherwise you end up in jail.  If the government spent in 'murica-bucks without taxing in that same currency, nobody would accept them as payment.  If the government suddenly started demanding taxes in that currency, people would be lining up to earn them, because they'd know they can spend them on to other people who also have tax obligations to fulfill.  This is the fundamental value of fiat currency, fiat meaning currency that is willed into existence -- it has value because you need it more than you need any other valuable object barring food and water.  Death and taxes are a constant, and you need USD to pay your taxes.  This inevitability, this unavoidable constant is also partially what gives the dollar stability and gravitas --  people are content to save it, and people are content to use it as a medium of exchange, because it has the ability to pay a debt that no other substance on earth can.  The dollar is more powerful than gold -- just go try to pay your tax bill in gold nuggets if you think that's incorrect.

So now that that's out of the way, let's rewind -- taxes give the dollar value, but what about the US government and its ability to create USD out of thin air?  Well, that's part two of why comparing government finances to your personal finances is a recipe for paranoia.  It's literally the root cause of hundreds of thousands of gadsden flags to be hoisted across america by well-meaning patriots.  But here's the truth: not only do taxes in the modern era primarily exist to give fiat currency value, they *aren't even necessary to fund government*.  That's right, your taxes don't fund a single fucking thing.  In fact, the money you send to the IRS is essentially destroyed.  The little ones and zeroes the banks move from one spreadsheet to another when tax day arrives doesn't really do anything.  Why?  Because -- and we're really beating the horse here -- *the federal government is the sole issuer of dollars in the world, and can create that currency out of thin air whenever it wants*.  It does not need your tax money to spend.  It can create it.  Does it make sense to you that if the US government can create dollars out of thin air, they need to wait to collect yours first?  Fucking *no*.

And this should hopefully bring us to the next great revelation: to you, money is a store of value.  To the US government, it is *not* a store of value.  How could it be a store of value, when the government can alter the amount of it at will, either by increasing taxes and destroying it, or by creating and spending more of it into the economy, thereby increasing its supply?  So what the fuck?  Well, to the US government, money is a *tool*, not a store of value.  The governments role is to use the supply of money to regulate the economy.  In a recession, it can use its enormous power to connect idle labor with idle resources to create real economic growth by *spending money into the economy*.  Government can will dollars into creation, and then use it to buy things from people and businesses that are otherwise experiencing no demand in a down economy.  This isn't financial voodoo, it's using money as a fucking tool, the way a government is supposed to use it.  When the economy is hot, and unemployment is low, then government can do the opposite -- take money out of the economy to avoid inflation, either by spending less, increasing taxes, raising interest rates (which motivates people to trade their dollars, which don't pay any interest, to government paper like bonds and treasuries, which do -- while simultaneously taking their dollars out of the circulating supply).

The major point here is that government is not revenue constrained, and that debt to the government is absolutely fucking irrelevant, because, and this is the real kicker if you've followed me this far -- the national debt is a fucking account artifact, an irrelevant holdover from the days when we spent in a currency we did *not* control, like gold.  Today, the national debt reflects the number of dollars the government has spent into the economy -- and *each one of those dollars exists as savings in the non-government sector*.  In other words, if the government spends $1mn into the economy, it's you and I who are the beneficiaries.  That money is used to buy real goods and services, and we are now $1mn richer.  The call to ""pay down the debt"" is literally a call to say ""we want the government to remove money from the economy to reduce an irrelevant accounting artifact that scares us because we're fucking ignorant.""

To finally address your original concern about how much government paper the Fed is holding -- that's actually a good thing.  The economy is fucking hot as shit right now, and inflation is finally starting to ramp up.  Unfortunately, we have a congress filled idiots who blocked every bit of government spending back when we had a recession 10 years ago, and who now -- when the economy is hot -- are spending like drunken sailors.  Ironic, since they're the ones who were complaining about the short road to hyperinflation for the last decade while inflation languished around 1%, and the economy suffered from high unemployment, because none of those stupid fuckers could wrap their heads around the fact that government finances are not analogous to household finances, and that they should allowed the government to step in and bridge the gap between idle labor and idle resources.  But i digress.  Holding all that paper allows the Fed to soak up all the extra money being pumped into the economy at a time it doesn't need it (tax cuts increase the money supply, huge government spending bills increase the money supply). Interest rates are going to go through the fucking roof, so buy a house now if you want one in the next 10 years."

RBI buys USD worth around 5% of GDP,"India and USA are trade deficit countries, they import more than they export. 48 billion for india and 618 billion for USA.

To increase exports your currency should be devalued, china devalues it's currency artificially, india can't do that so they stock up on dollars which kind of pushes for devaluation and increased exports.

Advantage of hoarding US dollar other than devaluation is as reserve, in case FPI money stops coming into India in future India buys oil in dollars so they will have to first buy dollars and then buy oil. So bigger dollar reserve means safety in bad times. India biggest import is oil and gold. Every time we buy both india becomes poorer due to the outflow.

Would USA want to devalue it's currency to pay of debt - Yes and No.
If they devalue while they are importing more cost will raise, inflation, angry people.
If they don't the interest payment on 23 trillion will be a pain without raising taxes.

Economics is basically finding a balance and not necessarily going too far in one direction. However usa has already gone too far with printing money so no one knows how long the party will last or what will happen, we are in uncharted waters.

They hold the biggest gold reserves as well so if faith in dollar decreases and we all go back to gold backed currency they have plenty of that too."
"Roaring Kitty, how to determine value of a stock?","What you're looking for is a ***relative baseline***.

Everything in investing (much like life) is relative. What is it relative to? Everything else, of course.

Is company A a better bargain than company B? Is company A less risk to my principal than company B?

Howard Marks is fantastic for this (read his Oaktree memos).

Most people use 10yr US Treasuries as a faux ""absolute baseline"", ie: the safest thing I can buy, often called ""riskless"". The 10 yr Treasury rate is currently about 1.6%.

To figure out from a P/E perspective, we just flip the equation to E/P, to get an earnings yield, which can be compared to a bond yield like a US Treasury. A P/E of 10 is easy, 1/10 = 10% yield.

Typically, people apply a couple hundred basis points (fancy word for 1/100th percent) to account for the risk between a stock and a bond, but of course it depends an awful lot on which stock or which bond.

For the riskless rate, let's apply 3.5% premium (350 basis points) to compare a treasury to a company we think is very safe). 1.6% 10yr Treasury + 3.5% premium gives us 5.1%. So the hurdle (rate which we must beat) for the stock to be a better deal than the treasury is a 5.1% yield. What is this in P/E? Just invert. 100/5.1 = P/E 19.6

Now you can decide things like ""Do I think interest rates (and treasury yields) will go up the next year or two? Maybe I want to give myself more room to account for this. Maybe I want to hunt stocks under 15 P/E, or 10 P/E, etc.

There's more nuance, but this is how intelligent people approach the process.

Definitely read Security Analysis, cover to cover, at least once."

We figured since the mortgage was for the full amount of the house that 10% of the loan would released when we exchanged contracts to pay the deposit. NOPE. You need to front up the deposit and the bank will 'pay you back' when the house is settled. So for that 6 weeks or whatever you need to be OK being out 80K or whatever the 10% deposit price is.

We felt so stupid. But then started hearing of lots of other people who got caught in the same position. So even though for professional adults this probably sounds like something really obvious, its actually not until you get caught out. 

The REA and our conveyancer had even been like 'so, you have your deposit?' And we'd be like 'nah we have a guarantor' and they'd just sorta nod along like that made sense. Nobody explained it to us until the point where we actually needed to pay the deposit."
"Homes are selling insanely fast, with some going $1-200k over asking price. What does that mean for the future?","Like many things it depends and it's very regional. 

In some places it's driven by market forces and low supply especially around major metros and tech hubs, places like Florida have the usual influx of retirees plus new younger home buyers. Finally a few mid west or more middle America are seeing an uptick as WFH professionals seek to maximize their housing dollars. There's also a lot of investors looking to gobble up prime real estate either to flip or keep as long term investment.

Lots of the frenzy is built  on a combination of factors mostly due to the low interest rate environment, pent up demand from year of COvID ,more workplaces offering more flexible wfh arrangements and increase in millennials ready to settle down. ..

No one knows if this is a bubble, because it's very different than 2008  , some regions could be in bubble territory depending on what happens when the moratoriums end, others could just be the new normal."
"Why do most day traders lose money, what do they do wrong?","Risk management is the main differentiating factor. Due to human nature/psychology and whatever you wanna call it, most just simply aren’t able to do it. Someone can 99 good trades with solid consistent profits, get greedy on the 100th one thinking they can 10x their money in a jiffy, and lose everything they had made in those first 99 trades in that one 100th trade. This sort of thing happens all the time and it can happen to anyone, no matter how well disciplined they think they are.

Those who end up surviving are those who literally manage to ‘survive’ without losing their entire account for long enough (at least a couple of years at the earliest, if not more) while they navigate the learning curve and hopefully come out ahead. But it’s rare and most will either lose a substantial amount of money and give up and/or decide that they would’ve actually made so much profit had they just bought and hold some good stocks and/or index funds during all that time, and just go back to doing that (which is ultimately the safest most reliable way for anyone to make money in the market, buy index funds and/or some solid blue chip stocks, keep contributing cash to the account as possible, and forget about the account for a few years).

Right now, there’s tons of traders in the market who started trading after the March crash. Things have gone up since then in the most historic bull run in the market’s history. Someone essentially could’ve closed their eyes and pull some ticker names out of a hat and most likely they would’ve made money on them in the last few months. So there are traders out there who feel they’ve figured out the game and it’ll be smooth sailing from here. We see this type of posts all the time, like ‘check out my $500 to $5000 in last 3 months’ type of stuff. One semi-major speed bump in the market (which are inevitable from time to time) and most of these traders will be wiped out, and the cycle will begin again.

Those who have been around longer always take the market with a healthy dose of skepticism and try to have their ducks in a row as much as possible, but that doesn’t mean they also aren’t susceptible to being wiped out if the perfect storm comes around.

Good luck to all!"
"Why $FLT$ (Canadian Stock, TSX) is the next stock to blow up, and why I'm all in.","guys, it's not just about small drones delivering packages from amazon.  


At this time DDC is targeting industry, not individuals. And their drones and packages are not limited to 'small'. Their largest drone, the Condor, has a payload capacity of 400 lbs and a range of 200 km.   


They're doing quite well right now with growing their business in the scope just discussed. Letters of intent, vaccine delivery contracts, and no reason to stop growing.  


But if we're going to talk about long term potential, it's not limited to delivery of packages either. DDC has **goodwill and trust** from regulatory bodies. There aren't many companies doing what they're doing, and no one knows how to regulate airspace. DDC now has a track record of doing it, and maintains their open cooperative relationship with Transport Canada and other regulatory bodies. So when other countries start thinking about how to safely integrate drones into their airspace, who will they come to?   


Finally, in my opinion they should be nicely positioned to expand into other areas with the expertise they develop from operating the package delivery drones. Human transportation (air taxi) drones, and industrial inspection and maintenance are examples of adjacent industries that have great growth potential and not a lot of competition. DDC will have built expertise that can pave the way there. Point being, they're not going to be limited to delivering packages. Not sure if they'll just spin off another company if they decided to do that... they are called Drone Delivery after all. It's just my take on it. In for 2214 shares $1.16 avg."
IRS will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments,"Well that sounds fascinating!

Just to make it clear for anyone who may have been confused as I was when reading the post before the article, the matching contribution from the employer would go into the employee's 401(k) and not go towards repaying the student loan. In that way whether the employee chooses to put money away towards their retirement in the 401(k) or to pay down their student loans, it is simply treated equivalently in giving 401(k) matching contributions from the employer.

I look forward to seeing if employers start to adopt this!"

McDonald’s is spending nearly $1 billion in 2019 to add ordering kiosks and other tech to stores.,"IMO the money here is the ability for the kiosks to upsell compared to humans taking your order. I'm sure they have data showing the average order size is larger through a kiosk than human.

Kiosks let you browse the menu better and with photos of all items, they can try to upsell you to make it a meal, upsize, etc 100% of the time, they can push promotions and specials, they encourage browsing more of the menu as there's less of a time crunch to complete your order.

"True or False: If you have income without working, someone somewhere else is working for it","I have never heard of this YouTube channel. You make the relevant points at the end of your own post....

&gt; One could argue that the owners of assets are taking on a) risk, b) require capital to buy assets in the first place and c) circulate their income investing in ventures and buying goods and services (but only if the economy is growing).

I agree with you about your points (a) and (b) here. Someone like a passive asset owner or a landlord takes on risk. This is one of the main reasons why their assets produce a return. They also provide capital. I won't go into point (c) here.

It's worth starting with (b).... In some ways it's incorrect to say that investors provide capital. What they provide is related to time. All goods are produced using labour and capital. That includes all capital goods. So, in the end everything is produced using only labour and natural resources. Since every piece of capital is produced using those things if you look back far enough.

When we say that there's a return to capital, we mean that there's a return to owning it for a period of time. That's because of *time-preference*. The owner of capital could sell that capital and spend the money at any time. Every person who chooses to hold on to capital has decided not to do that. There must be some return for them to motivate them to make that decision. For example, suppose that you are given the choice between $100 now and $100 in a year's time. I suspect that you would choose $100 now. After all, even if it turns out that you have no use for the $100 then you could keep it until the next year anyway. Assets pay a return in the future. So, any asset holder must be happy to wait for that return. This narrows down the number of people willing to hold assets. That means that assets must provide a return or they would not be produced in the first place. Suppose that John is offered a risk-free investment that will pay $103 next year if he puts in $100 now. He decides to invest. Terry is given the same offer, but decides not to invest because he values $100 now higher than $103 next year.

What I've written above applies to *risk-free* assets. Moving to your (a), in practice, assets include risk. Just as there is *time-preference* there is also *risk-tolerance*. Some people are prepared to take more risk than others. Those people can trade their higher risk tolerance for higher returns. They do so at the risk of sharply lower returns and even zero returns. We see this in the stock market. With risk comes extra return.

These are the forces that drive capital incomes, they're different from those creating labour income. It's not that capital owners are earning from workers. It's a separate type of income. All are related to *disutility* though. Labour income comes from the disutility of working. Risk-free capital income comes from the disutility of waiting. Risky capital income comes from the disutility of taking risk. Without people in the economy willing to bear all these forms of disutility production could not occur."
What are the most valuable community college degrees?,"Please do not listen to reddit on this kind of thing. People here ***wildly*** overestimate/overvalue any sort skilled or semi-skilled trade pay. I think people on reddit have a fetish with ""manly"" careers, or at least are blissfully unaware of little most of them pay.

For example, the most highly rated comment in this thread claims you can make $100k driving a truck. The ***median pay*** for truck drivers is ***41k a year***, and the top 10% make ***$63k***. I'm sure someone makes $100k driving a truck, but its gotta be the top 0.1%.

Inevitably, when someone points out the data to debunk these wildly inflated salaries people on reddit throw out for trade skills, we get a lot of people commenting about how they know person X who is in a trade and makes a ton of money. That is called an ***argument by exception***. Medians and percentile rankings represent a large number of people. You can still know someone who makes $100k in a trade while the median is $40k. It is sort of like arguing that because Bill Gates dropped out of college and made billions, it is a good idea to drop out of college. 

***Edit 1:*** I am getting a lot of people responding to me trying to qualify their claims by saying that you have to move to make these huge dollar figures. The numbers I am looking at cover the entire United States, your local market may pay $60k+ for truck driving but that just means your market is on the right side of the income distribution. 

***Edit 2:*** I am also seeing a lot of people replying and claiming that these $100k figures are real, but only if you drive your own truck and work for yourself. The great thing is the BLS also has data on self-employed individuals in this profession.  Self employed individuals in the following occupations do ***not*** make much more than traditional employees: Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers, Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers, and Industrial Truck and Tractor Operators.

"Bought a hotel, converted to apartments $0 down","There’s been a few comments that were surprised we can charge $850 per month. So just to lay out the housing situation in my area, it’s bad. There’s a few trailer parks that are charging between 1000 and 1200 per month, for single wide trailers that take an additional 5 to 800 per month in electric to heat and cool. Over the winter three different homes have burnt down because they are poorly maintained, built in the 70s, roughly 900 square-foot. A single-family home starts at 1600 per month to rent. There are a few 2 bed apartments that are in the $1100 per month range, and they were waiting list of over 100 people. They also don’t take vouchers :-/

The Housing Authority and nonprofits currently spend $85 per night on rooms at a few hotels. So over $2,500 a month for similar housing. They were thrilled to be paying $850 for a year solution.

The people who are on disability and also receiving a voucher are also thrilled to be spending $50 out of pocket, and have all of their utilities covered. We are paying for the electric, gas, Internet, TV, septic, water, and trash. It keeps their cost-of-living low, So they’re no longer choosing between heating the house medicine and food."

[Serious] This Subreddit has such recency bias that goldfish look like they have photographic memory.,"Since covid began, the personal finance portion of Reddit has been filled with first time investors that are investing based on their emotions and what everyone else is doing.

The biggest mistake I made when I started was: “I’M DOWN 5%! I MUST SELL!” If you believe in what you’re buying (for me S&amp;P 500 because stock picking isn’t in my nature), this is the time you put together a strategy and stick to it.

Weekend GME Thread + Homework for all: Let's stop using brokerages that halted trading,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

 8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

 9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

ADVICE for NEW and SERIOUS TRADERS,"This is exceptional advice.  A few additional things I have found:

- For every great buy you will find on here, you have to go through 20-50 others that either are not that good or you are too late for.  I always first look at a stock chart on each stock.  If a stock has already made a huge jump from say $.05 to $.85... I say, “Crap, missed my chance there.  How could I have caught that before it shot up?”  But jumping into a stock after a huge jump turn out to be a bad move more often than a good one.  But overall, I gather up 20-30 interesting stocks, that I will sort through hoping to find 1 or 2 that I may actually throw money at.

- When I put money at anything under $2, I always put in a sell order right away for one half my shares if it doubles.  So, if I buy 1,000 shares of something for $.45, I will put add a sell limit order of 500 shares at $.90.  That is a hedge that allows me to get my entire investment back while still having a stake.  By cashing my initial investment, I can be more aggressive or patient with my remaining shares - it is basically house money at that point.  It is crazy how many times doing this paid off way quicker than I expected.  I can’t watch the market all day during work hours.

- Ask questions in the DD threads.  I have seen lots of people in this sub say that they don’t understand the financials and other tools evaluation.  Most every one here will go out of their way to teach you whatever you don’t know.  If you learn it, you can then help do your own DD and let us move through more prospects more quickly.  

- I try to limit my new investments to about one new stock a week.  I honestly don’t know how you could do enough DD on much more than a couple a week - which I find it is helpful to ask which one is best than just throwing money at everything that looks promising.   Say you have three EV stocks you are looking at.  I find it is best to force myself to pick the best.  Also, if you jump on the daily thread and pick 20 tickers to throw money at, you would be well served to slow down and get more judicious about your targets.  

Anyways, great OP!"
"If you think CryptoKitties is about cats, you're missing the entire point...","Unfortunately, the truth is that we cannot currently sustain this ideology.

Now imagine this frustration wasn't over kitties but it was over loot in WoW, rare collectibles, plots of land all over the world or stocks.... You'd be furious.

The concept is incredible, but let's focus on the fundamentals of blockchain technology first. Ethereum is currently SEVERELY limited in transaction capacity.

Yes, these solutions are coming, but it might be smart to slow the train until they are tested and proven before people get so fed up with the sluggishness of the blockchain that Ethereum ends up being discredited in the meantime.

Also, if you can ever identify someone misrepresenting themselves as one of you, they can issue C&amp;D letters to those bad actors.  I've already had one of them look at the potential liability of WSB both from my own perspective but also that of the random members and even the runners of the sub, and he said it was clear that there were no legal concerns there, other than the weight of a hedge fund or an entity trying to lean their chipstack into it and hoping the other side will buckle for lack of resources.

The Incan Empire was the most successful centrally planned economy in history. My understanding of economics led me to believe that Centrally Planned Economies are fundamentally untenable. So why was the Incan economy so successful? Why did the Incans succeed where the Soviets failed?,"We have only limited information about how the Incan economy worked - some contemporary accounts by the Spanish conquerors and some posthumous accounts by Incan descendants, plus what archaeology can dig up. Then the surviving data has gone through various ideological filters. There is some evidence of markets in the Andean economy. Hirth &amp; Pillsbury (2013) note that there's some evidence of Inka goods appearing in these markets, implying some unofficial trade, and that the view of John Murra that there wasn't market activity was deeply influenced by Karl Polanyi, and evolved over time. 

The Soviet Union wasn't a simple centrally planned economy either. There were varying degrees of legal market activity, such as collective farms being able to sell food they produced above their quotas. And we do know there can be differences between the official accounts and the day-to-day reality, for example while state-owned enterprises in the Soviet Union were officially centrally planned, they'd employ buyers to trade with other such enterprises to get their needed inputs. For all we know, the Incans similarly had flexibility like that, both de jure and de facto.

TL;DR: we don't have the data to answer.

"Historically it's way better to invest at market close than at market open, most gains occur overnight","It's NOT TRUE to say ""it's better to invest at market open than at market close."" The red line on your graph shows that during daytime trading, prices have essentially averaged out to flat (0%). That means if you bought in the morning, you would do just as well as if you bought at close, as long as you're not selling your whole portfolio EVERY NIGHT and re-buying it every morning. In other words, someone who buys in the morning and holds gets to enjoy the overnight growth just as much as someone who bought right before close. So, you don't get any advantage by placing orders at the end of the day instead of the beginning.

Also, while this statistic is surprising, it's not as crazy as it sounds. There are only 6.5 trading hours per business day. Adjusting for holidays, there are 253 trading days per year, so 1644 trading hours. There are 8760 total hours in a year, so only 19% of total time is during trading hours. Thus, we'd expect 80% of the gains would happen outside trading hours anyway. It's surprising that it's ""100%"", but still not as crazy as it sounds at first glance."

My Dad just figured out he's been paying $30/month for AOL dial-up internet he hasn't used for at least the last ten years.,"True story- my mom died rather suddenly a bit less than a decade ago, and my dad and I had to go through all her subscriptions etc and discontinue them. This usually involved sending people copies of her death certificate so they would believe us that she had died.

AOL was the only company that wouldn't accept her death certificate. They demanded that we give them her account password or they refused to shut down her account. Since we didn't have the password, they kept billing her credit card.

I'll skip all the letters and phone calls my dad used to try and end the madness - eventually, he called the credit card company. They said they couldn't simply block one company from charging, but they Could create a new credit card and transfer any Other charges over to the new card (car insurance etc) while leaving AOL to charge the defunct number. We readily agreed. Soon, AOL was sending us angry letters and collection notices with late fees and penalties applied. Because they wanted money from my dead mother for the Internet she wasn't using.

When AOL finally gave up, they forwarded our account to a debt collector... who contacted us once and then stopped upon realizing mom was dead and we didn't even want the service.

I will never forget the final letter AOL sent us, after more than a year of fighting....

Is planned obsolescence necessary in a capitalist economy?,"&gt;Is planned obsolescence necessary in a capitalist economy?

No.

&gt;In my US History class in high school we learned that one factor that lead to the Great Depression was items that were ""too good."" The explanation was that in the beginning of the 1920's people bought many appliances and other stuffs. However, since the products were built-to-last, products were being bought less and less over time leading to a less stimulated economy.

That.. was a terrible history class then. That's not even really in the ballpark of remotely correct explanations.

A lot of things happened, for a decent relatively detailed account, see here:

https://eh.net/encyclopedia/an-overview-of-the-great-depression/

But by and large the cause of the great depression was bad monetary policy.

Also, no, planned obsolescence is not necessary for a capitalist economy. The thing is, individual companies are of course interested in people spending their money on their products, but as far as the economy as a whole is concerned, this doesn't matter. If people would buy longer lasting products, they wouldn't just have more money they would never touch, they would simply spend it on something else."

Is trading easy like this??!!,"As someone who has been trading now for over six years, I have learnt a few things over my time and can offer some great advise that I'm sure everyone else will agree on. So with that being said, here it is! (If you learn something from this UPVOTE so others can read and learn from it!)

Risk Management - Before you even thing about placing a trade using real funds ensure you are implementing good Risk Management, now what do I mean by that? Well set a risk % and stick to it throughout, personally I risk no more than 2% of my entire equity per trade. This means it would take 50 consecutive losses to blow my account. If you don't know how to calculate the correct Lot Size for a 2% risk I can share my formula. 

Risk to Reward Ratios (RR) - This also falls under Risk Management, but when you look at placing a position, ensure that you have a good RR ratio. Again I personally make sure I have at least a 1:2 RR meaning im looking to make back at least double my initial risk on the trade, with me risking 2% being 1 in the RR ratio im looking to make back at least 4% being 2 in the ratio. You don't ever want to risking more than your potential return that just doesn't make sense. So when you look to place a position ensure that your TP can always be at least double your SL obviously making sure that your TP is achievable and your SL is placed accordingly. 

Psychology - This is probably the most difficult thing to master and can only be mastered in time. my advise is ensure that you have as much confluence/confirmation with your trade setup as possible, alleviate all doubt in your analysis and position. Once you have set your parameters with your trade, there will be places within the market that if price surpasses it would invalid your analysis and therefore you would look to exit the market or have SL's set there. Once you place a position, leave it don't STARE. Set your alerts and wait for them to ping, the worst thing you can do if your not mentally strong is stare at a running position.

Back Testing &amp; Trialing your Strat - Before you go straight to real funds, ensure you have taken the time to practice, make sure your strategy works and make sure you stick to it. I personally have a checklist of things I need to see in order for me to place a position, without every step being ticked I won't place it, you should do the same! You don't ride a bike on two wheel before you've learnt how to, you use stabilisers the same applies to trading, practice first before your confident in your ability. 

Now with all that being said if you follow just some of that advice you'll notice a drastic change in your trading experience and for the better! Ensuring you implement risk management is one of the biggest, you don't want to over leverage or over expose yourself on positions. More than anything though, have fun enjoy the process and don't trade with money you can't afford to lose! If you learnt something from this UPVOTE so others can read and learn from it!"

If we can band together over something like this that can &amp; will be how we actually make positive change happen!
Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,"Nobody here gives a fuck about you or your family. Most everybody in the crypto space is only here to make money. In that way Elon Musk is very similar to everyone else here. 

The only reason you say any of this is because Elon Musk is a celebrity. You hold him to a higher standard because he is a public figure. You wouldn't expect u/glasswallet to exercise the same level of activism as you do from Elon Musk. Even though there's plenty more I could do to for the crypto movement. 
Its ironic because he's probably done more for crypto than any one individual. (Other than Satoshi or Vitalik) I honestly don't think theres anything he could do to ever satisfy you. 

the fact is he doesn't owe you anything. Just because he has more reach than the average Joe doesn't mean he is obligated to dedicate his entire life to crypto. He's living his life as he personally sees fit just as everyone else here is. 

It should be enough for you that one of the most famous people in the world is discussing his interest in crypto and making moves. This post just comes off as salty. He's in the news because he's interesting, opinionated, and is a celebrity talking about crypto. Not because he's some crypto idol who's word is gospel."

Is OnlyFans Marxist?,"While “is X Marxism” usually earns a response of “there is no one definition of Marxism,” I feel fairly confident saying that entrepreneurship through a private non-governmental platform is not Marxism.

Also, *renting* the means of production is very different from *owning* them. Eg OnlyFans can kick you off the platform at their whim."
"Is it true that ""if the minimum wage had risen in step with productivity growth since 1968, it would be over $24 an hour today.""","A key (and misleading) assumption in that assertion is its implicit assumption that minimum wage ought track along with productivity; if that's the only basis, it would be about $24 or so I guess. In years past this was previously regarded as being appropriate by some economic thinkers like Marx, but is not widely believed by modern economists today.

An alternate method of calculation might be to take the [federal minimum wage for 1968](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart) ($1.60) and adjust purely for inflation using something like the [Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), which would indicate that it should be about $12.27.  In this sense, the Politifact checker cited is pretty much on track.

This gets problematic though, since it doesn't take into account whether $12.27 would really be sufficient to provide a comparable relative standard of living in the current era, when things like housing, cars, and healthcare are much more expensive if for no other reason than they're much safer and more advanced now. Something like broadband internet access would have been a fantastically unimaginable luxury in 1968, but now is often considered essential or nearly so. In this sense, just pegging wages to any one metric might not be answering the wider social questions well enough.

Another popular method of selecting minimum wage target is 150% of the [federal poverty level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines) for a family of 4; the idea being that any person working full-time ought to be able to provide such a standard of living to her/his family at a minimum. In 2021 for the lower 48 this would amount to $39,750/yr, or about $19.40/hr assuming 51 weeks/yr and 40 hrs/week. And while this method might seem intuitive, it is not without criticisms, if for no other reason than this 150% target is arbitrarily selected and based on a multiple of a figure that is almost as arbitrarily selected.

REN has a pretty nice [FAQ about minimum wage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage) that you might look over too.

Edit 1: wrong year for comparison, sorry for confusion

Edit 2: added 150% poverty target, some other cleanup"

Jim Cramer Gave an Interview in 2006 on how the Hedge Funds Manipulate the Markets,"If you're curious to understand what this looks like in real time, take a look at the GME this Thursday 1/28/2021 when it went artificially from \~$390/share to a low of around \~$125 in \~50 minutes despite a ridiculously low volume of shares being traded. It's a play called a ""short ladder"" (I'm new to all of this but hell if I'm not learning a ton these last few weeks!)I'm still baffled at how disgusting these moves are... and I'd wager it's far from over.

Edit to add what short ladder attack is:

Say price of XYZ stock is $400/share.

Hedge A sells shares of XYZ stock to Hedge B for $390. Hedge B sells shares of XYZ stock back to Hedge A for $380. They ping pong back and forth on an extremely rapid pace, making it appear that the new price per share is far lower than the market value previously was. This spooks the hell out of people who are worried about losing their entire investment and they sell (probably at a loss), Hedges scoop up shares they've shaken out and the price rises back to it's regular level when they're done."
What’s the point of “rigorous” math in Economics?,"It's really easy to claim in blocks of text that certain things cause certain economic phenomena and obfuscate it with the English language to hide any logical fallacies/inconsistencies. However, it is really difficult to do this with mathematics, so when writing a proof of something, it's really easy to pick up where a person's model is actually false. But yes, the more you pursue economics, things like Data Analysis and all, I won't say you would need all of it, and it's certainly a futile exercise to persist with multi-variate calculus and all, but one of those things that are 'just there'. It's a lot better once you're out of college. I survived my time. :p You can too. And it's just as investing when you see it later. Good luck."

Is poverty largely due to corruption and authoritarianism?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index

Research papers published in 2007 and 2008 examined the economic consequences of corruption perception, as defined by the CPI.

I've been in crypto for over a year and I understand the basics about many of the projects and I get why some of the projects will be used in the future.

"Apparently McDonalds pays 2-3x in Denmark what they do in the US, but prices are only slightly higher. How does the math work for it to still be worth running a franchise?","So [this Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-mcdonalds-franchises/) has a [table](https://i.imgur.com/ZoLFd0w.jpg) that breaks down the finances for McDonald's franchises in the US (credit to /u/uptons_bjs for finding it). Based on this table, we can try and estimate the price/quantity change needed to support higher wages in the US. Specifically, let's see what needs to happen in order to keep the profit quantity constant. 


**Case 1: Growing Sales**

Suppose that McDonalds was able to grow net sales by keeping prices constant. Furthermore, suppose that the composition of new sales was such that the composition of increased expenses did not change. In other words, assume that sales growing by 10% caused all other expenses to grow by the same amount. We don't have enough data to figure out what to assume otherwise, hence this is the simplest assumption. But, this will *overestimate* the quantity growth required to raise profit. 

[This table](https://i.imgur.com/CiXSUJ5.png) shows the necessary growth in sales in order to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. Basically, if net sales and the cost of goods go up by 77.5% along with other expenses, we can hit about the same level of total operating income as before. 


**Case 2: Raising Prices**

This time, suppose McDonalds just raised prices. We will also assume complete inelasticity of demand (very wrong assumption!). We don't have enough data to figure out the true elasticity, so this is a generous assumption. Then, a Y% increase in prices will increase net sales by Y%, since we're assuming quantity sold doesn't change. At the same time, we can assume that all other costs and expenses are constant, since quantity sold is constant. 


Here's [the table](https://i.imgur.com/mbPC28O.png) but it now also shows how much of a price increase we need to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. As you can see, it's 37.5% which is a lot less than the quantity increase needed. 


**Case 3: Both**

There's multiple possible solutions here. Note that a 10% sales growth and 10% price growth will raise net sales by 1.1^2 = 1.21. So, the math is a little bit different from before. However, we are again assuming inelastic prices and that quantity growth causes an equivalent percentage change in each row. 

The last part of [this table](https://i.imgur.com/9iF9yR1.png) shows that 15% price growth and 12% sales growth is enough to ensure profit stays the same. 

----

So, basically, with  a moderate increase in price and sales, US franchises could face double the payroll expenses without losing much operating income. 

But, take this all with a big grain of salt, because I've made some major simplifying assumptions to do the math here."
Don’t take your small gains for granted. $600 profit a week is the same as a $15/hr full time job,"Without providing context of capital invested this isnt helpful to people. Consistent, % based gains is all that matters. So if you're doing this with a 300k port thats 10% and totally doable.

"Homes are selling insanely fast, with some going $1-200k over asking price. What does that mean for the future?","I wouldn't speak to much to the macro effects but I work in real estate so I'll lay out a few concepts. Sorry I'm on mobile. 

The prices are high right now for at least three reasons. The lowering of interest rates means people can spend more and keep the same monthly payment they would have 2 years ago. Sellers have seen this and began raising prices last year as more people were shopping for homes then previously.

Building materials have gone up in cost across the nation. From my understanding this is partly due to the forest fires in California, and partly due to covid restrictions on staffing at lumber mills. I believe tariffs have also had an effect. This has led to showing production. I've known a few builders that have just stopped production entirely last year.

More jobs going online and work from home have given people the freedom to live further away from their work and to live where they've wanted to move. This includes people from HCOL areas moving to cheaper markets and beyond and to offer cash on top of what a bank would be able to loan on a property. 

This has all compounded to a lack of supply on a national scale. Some states have been hit worse then others.

Our system of typical home loans requiring appraisals has at least slowed down the raise in pricing, but hasn't stopped the people with extra resources from offering over the appraised value. Appraiser's can only use comparable past sales to bracket appraised value with similar homes. As more homes are sold for inflated values, this become less of a hindrance on the values appraisers can reach.

Common perception in my corner of the real estate corner is that values will lower as interest rates raise. The speed for both would depend on the federal reserve. Im personally not sure how much they'll lower, since production is in no way close to making up for the lack of supply. Even when production rates were at full capacity two years ago, some markets still had signs of lack of supply, so I'm not sure how they would catch up. 

How many jobs will continue to support remote workers? When will building material production raise enough to lower supply cost? Will we struggle with finding labor for the needed housing supply? Will interest rates raise too sharply force home values to crash? Stay tuned for the next episode"

AMA: I am a wealth advisor to high net worth individuals and institutions ($5M-$1B+),"[This classic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s9u0s/what_do_insanely_wealthy_people_buy_that_ordinary/cnnmca8/) from 6 years ago breaks down different levels of wealth and what people at each level are like. Does this summary match what you see today? If not, how is it different?

As a summary, it states:

* **$10mm-$30mm liquid (exclusive of value of primary residence):** At this level, your needs are met. You can live very comfortably at a 4-star/5-star level. You can book a $2000 suite for a special occasion.
* **$30mm-$100mm:** At this point, you start playing with the big boys. You can travel ANYWHERE in any style. You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as 'rich people stuff'
* **$100mm-$1billion:** I know its a wide range, but life doesn't change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm. At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars/politicians/rock stars/corporate elite/aristocracy.
* **$1billion:** I am going to exclude the $10b+ crowd, because they live a head-of-state life. But at $1b, life changes. You can buy anything. ANYTHING."

"I'll give $1,000 to anyone who can disprove the thesis","I've been searching for similar answers as you for months, and I don't think they exist, to the point I'm seriously considering offering to add additional cash to your proposals to up the ante on those who think they can prove your thesis wrong. 

In my opinion this is one of the best posts to hit Reddit recently. The theories in question are clear and concise, and offer ways to disprove them that have yet to be disproven. These are the questions that need to be answered for me to ever have a single ounce of faith in the US stock market. 

The thing is, if someone out there has solid undeniable proof that the GME thesis is incorrect, then the inaccessibility for transparent information on that proof is directly impacting the investment decisions of millions of individual investors, and allows the traders with the knowledge of the proof to make unfair, advantageous, and just down right predatory decisions based around the stock.

The extremely ineffective US finance regulatory systems which allow reported information to be diluted, wrong, unnecessarily confusing, and/or just straight up hidden behind paywalls can't continue, it just simply can't. It's been 9 fucking months and still no one has answers on what really happened on Jan 28th? Let alone everyday since? Every transaction on the stock market leaves a paper trail, the apes have showcased a lot of possible scenarios of manipulation, HF/Media/SEC/etc have shown absolutely 0 possible scenarios of hedgies not being fuk'd.

The cool thing though is that even if someone did show me that the GME squeeze is not a possibility using math and facts, it's still a great fucking value play. It's a shame that the credibility of the US stock market has so much potential right now to completely crash and burn before GME even has the chance to really show us what it's worth.

FYI - This time last year BTC was $801 USD,"You're not wrong, but I think a direct correlation to Bitcoin is unwise. Not even considering total supply, remember that Bitcoin has years in development.

That being said I have 0 btc, and hold around 70% of my stake in eth. It is far superior and could definitely take over btc as the face of crypto but it'll take some time. The fact that we still compare it towards btc means that btc is still the poster child of the cypto market.

I found three physical copies of a Walt Disney share under my name,"""Disney stock has split seven times: in 1956, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1986, 1992 and 1998. The 1998 split was a 3-for-1 split. The splits in 1986 and 1992 were 4-for-1. The others were all 2-for-1. ""

&amp;#x200B;

1 share of Disney from 1956 would be 768 shares. I'm assuming OP isn't that old. Let's say they were bought prior to the 1986 split - that would be  48 shares x 3 = 144 shares @ $139/share would be just over $20,000."

"Looks like the recent RobinHood Class Action SI Report just proved /u/broccaaa's data. That the shorts haven't covered, that they hid SI% through Deep ITM CALLs, and SI% is a minimum of 226.42%.","For r/all;

Anything over 40% Short Interest (SI) is heavily shorted compared to other stocks.

100% SI means that a company is shorted by 100% of it's entire float, which just shouldn't ever happen.

140% SI is the maximum amount that would generally ever be reported, as 140% is the maximum legal amount shares can be rehypothecated, so claiming a SI% above that is openly admitting to crime.

226.42% means there has been a fucktonne of crime, and more counterfeit shares exist than real shares. They all have to be bought back, and when they the price will literally go parabolic.

EDIT
--------

Had a lot of people asking things like 'So what will actually force them to cover? Why can't they just keep conspiring?'

Listen, the worlds whack and no one can know anything for sure, but heres MY personal understanding, copied from my reply to someone else


ok here we go, bare in mind this is all my personal opinion again, not financial advice.

I'm not very good at essay writing, so forgive me if this is hard to read.

1) The shorts aren't going away unless they cover. If they truly plan to never cover, then they will be permanently be bleeding out fees, and banks who have lent them money will eventually want their money back.

Now you might propose, what if they conspire even more egregiously, and artificially force cover (without paying) the shares, well..

2) It isn't only retail investors invested in GME. One of GMEs top holders is Blackrock, who has 9,175,737 shares in GME, or 12.965% ownership. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/ Who is Blackrock?

risk management and fixed income institutional asset manager, BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with over $8 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock

They are the single largest company in the world by Assets Under Management, with a huge 12.9% ownership of GME, and as of 5/7/2021 their investment was valued at $1.74B. It's worth understanding that it wouldn't just be retail that they are fucking over if they try anything, how do you think a multi-trillion dollar company would react if a billion dollar investment of theirs was artificially devalued?

3) Trying anything funky would jeoporadise trust in the entire US markets. There are eyes and journalists all over the world paying attention to how this situation is handled. Imagine if they turn off the buy button again. Foreign investors would never want to invest in US markets again, it would be clear as day to the common man that the stock markets are rigged. The government doesn't want this.

4) SEC, DTCC, NSCC, aka the financial regulators, have been unleashing a SLURRY of new rules these past 6 months, most of which seem aimed at containing a fallout and what to do incase a member (bank) fails, limiting short hedge fund practices, faster margin calls, and generally 'tightening the noose' so to speak. Please read this post for more detailed information https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhh0f1/update_go_nogo_for_launch_the_checklist_keeping/ but basically why would they be preparing for a fallout so dilligently if they planned to pull the rug on retail investors and bail out sHFs and banks.

5) It doesn't have to be GME which ignites it's own fuse. There are a lot of theories that we are imminent for a market crash. I'm sure you've seen this on r/all recently; https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o4rfnu/the_fed_is_pinned_into_a_corner_from_the_2008/

In the event of a market crash, there will be lots of margin calls. Everyone is overleveraged as is, if assets market-wide drop 10, 20, 30%+ you can bet lots of places will have to liquidate, which will involve covering their short positions. Even if the top sHFs like citadel don't immediately have to, once someone smaller does, they will cover and rise the price a bit, which will make someone medium sized margin called and have to cover rising the price moderately, and these dominos will eventually reach citadel.

6) I'm sure there's some other stuff that I could mention but you're getting the picture, like the possibility of a crypto dividend.

Anyway, please keep asking questions, it's how we bolster our own understanding and strengthen any holes in our thesis.

About the deadlines, yeah there's a bit of a mix on this sub, some people like them because it gets us hype but others don't because if a date comes and goes it can be demoralising, and it's clear this is a patience game. I say get excited for dates but don't TRULY start believing any given date is the MOASS until it happens. One way to think of it is there is no dates, just times when the noose gets tigher and tighter, although I will say gosh it's looking pretty tight right now.

Hope this helped, is there anything else you want me to try to explain? This is good for me too because I understand things better when I explain it to someone else.

Why do we need to redistribute wealth?,"I would say that for the most part this is in practice rooted in human notions of ""fairness"", we strive to redistribute because we want to and because we want to shift the burden from those who in absolute terms have less to those who have more because we believe that's the right thing to do.

That doesn't mean there aren't any ""economic"" reasons to do so. We know empirically that (too much) inequality, be that in wealth or income (which after all, are related) can have adverse effects.

There's evidence that inequality hampers economic growth.

I hope you can see that the list of things negatively affected by inequality where there is either a direct impact on the economy or at the very least a conceivable connection to it is pretty long.

Why are so many Americans living above their means?,"I’m old and it has been this way as long as I can remember. What I do know for sure now that I’ve lived this long is how stressful these people’s lives become as their more frugal peers begin to retire early or buy second homes, etc. Some are temporarily bailed out by inheritances at some point and some actually end up with high paying positions where they can make up for their prior choices.

&gt;First, very high earners should be subject to high and rising marginal tax rates on earnings. Second, low-income families should be encouraged to work with earnings subsidies, which should then be phased-out with high implicit marginal tax rates. Third, capital income should be taxed.

Where exactly the top marginal rate should be set is a matter of dispute. A 2014 [paper](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saez-stantchevaAEJ14.pdf) in the *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,* authored by Piketty, Saez, and  Stantcheva, recommends a top rate of 71%, while Christina and David Romer from UC Berkeley have [recommended](http://ceg.berkeley.edu/research_117_2123314150.pdf) a top rate of over 80%. 

In addition, we have to think about taxing wealth. In a [paper](https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/progressive-wealth-taxation/) for the Brookings Institution, Saez and Zucman (both from UC Berkeley) talk about the best way to implement a wealth tax in the US, which could potentially raise a great deal of revenue and substantially reduce inequality. Of course, we then have to deal with issues like avoidance, which has been an issue with previous wealth taxes in other countries.

As for the question of justice, that's more of a moral and philosophical question than an economic one. Many people see reducing inequality as more just, and so would advocate those policies. You may advocate different ones."

"How can we prove if companies are raising prices disproportionately, but blaming it on inflation?","Not very easily.

What does it mean to raise prices higher than ""needed""?

If you just assume ""inflation"" is rising costs of inputs, it's relatively straightforward, given the data. Let's assume a company wants 2% profit, you just look at all the inputs, factor in the profit, and then you land at the ""correct"" price.

But that's not really how any of this works, or at best half of it.

Inflation happens primarily for two reasons, lower supply, or higher demand. Everything else being equal, higher demand means higher prices. That's just as ""valid"" as higher producer prices leading to higher consumer prices, and you can't figure that out from plain financial statements."

Today is a dark day for traders,"I put the following on the other sub, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today."
"Navi Loans: Uninstalling Navi app, even accidentally is considered fraud according to the T&amp;C","Navi app developer here, obviously from throwaway account. 

We collect all source of data from sms. Salary credited, account balance, savings percentage from initial salary credit at end of month, where is money going, using what heads, is it being saved or used as luxury or necessities.

This data helps us to create a profile for user to offer rate of interest, charges and poach that user data to other company for loan takeover at slightly better roi but a little higher one time charges. 

Removing app leaves control over data. Ofcourse we don't actively track it and not sure if we have ever enforce it legally but this is why it is set as best practices to keep app. 

Infact FB post and news articles are pushed from marketing team only so people get aware that they are not supposed to  remove app, if it comes from us, it looks scary. If it's coming from news article, people who take loan will not dare to remove. People who are too smart about privacy, roi, their charges anyways won't take loan from such companies. 

Am i proud of it? No. But it pays the bill.

Edit - we also used to collect data on contact and most used contact so we can ping them in case of default. But it was waste as we realise most of people most contacted no are not relatives or family. We concluded that now people mostly use whatsapp messaging and calling features to stay in touch with close one. So we stopped collecting that data."

Why don’t we just let major airlines collapse?,"I think I tend to agree with you! The only issue is that many employees would be hurt by this, and commerce throughout the country would be slowed without air travel for the near future. This is why others might not share your sentiment. 

Depending on the nature of this “bailout” I could see why it’s justified. If the airlines will pay the sum back to the federal govt with interest I don’t necessarily see the problem. Airlines operate on razor thin profit margins as it is. It’s an industry that is particularly vulnerable to crisis like this, despite an airlines best effort to prepare.

There is something to be said about moral hazard though. If industry expects to be bailed out when a crisis hits, why should they save money to weather crisis on their own?

A potential solution would be for them to take the bailout to pay salaries, and then shut down and cut costs to be as low possible until the demand for travel comes back."
Weeklies vs 30-45 DTE vs LEAPs - or how to pimp out your theta,"I have to disagree with this. The backtesting has been done and the win ratio for 45DTE 16-20delta options outperform. You mention 30 delta alot, but thats not the sweet spot. You also mention little risk on weeklies, but there is huge gamma risk so that couldn't be more false. Finally, you mention profit not being from theta decay on 45DTE which isn't accurate. Theta decay ramps up drastically from 45 to 21 days, but you fail to mention anything in your post about IV, IVR which is one of the most important indicators when selling options. 

You might on paper collect more selling 6 weeklies over one 45DTE, not by much, but the data clearly shows the success is in 45DTE with less risk than the success rate of weeklies which makes longer expiration superior"

The China hustle,"I think you shouldn’t invest in “emerging markets” unless you have a very good understanding of those markets, especially China. I lived in Beijing for nearly a decade, and the ignorance about China that I see from investors with positions in Chinese companies (or the closest thing you can get to such) is a bit shocking. Firstly, as a foreigner, you aren’t meant to have access to Chinese markets. They aren’t open to you, so all of the companies that you can buy into have gone against official directives and party narratives to open holding companies overseas in order to get some foreign money into the game. This doesn’t bode well for any of those companies. China seems like a capitalist, even a hypercapitalist country, but they aren’t. The central party is the arbiter of power. They maintain absolute control, and capitalist reforms are merely a tool for them to serve sociopolitical ends (development)."

what happens once everywhere in the US ends up too expensive for the working class?,"In the long run, the cost of housing will be determined by the marginal cost of building it. Unfortunately, [local land-use regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/g4bdb0/comment/fnwed99/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) are driving up production costs and/or preventing the construction of more affordable units. Over the long run, this is responsible for the increases we have seen in the cost of housing.

So what could happen as housing costs continue to increase? Well, a few things. Over time, the housing units we built have become nicer—larger square footage, more features (like A/C), etc. We could see an increase in more basic homes that cost a little less. However, as long as land-use regulations remain prevalent, the effect on the price of housing is likely to be limited.

But more broadly, we could see faster growth in the cities that have more relaxed regulations that allow the housing supply to expand. The increase in remote work could help facilitate this trend.

We could also see municipalities ease up land-use regulations to some degree, and there are a few places this appears to be happening already. This is likely more of a political science question though."
Why I gave up on active stock picking and sold every individual stock I own,"&gt;I eventually bought a few stocks and started tracking news about them regularly. I also followed discussions about these companies in forums and twitter so see if I had missed some important info.

Also, one doesn't need to monitor every stock every day or week or month. Just reviewing them quarterly is more than enough.

Also reading balance sheets should be enjoyable and exciting. If someone is reading it *just to make money*, they cannot last long.

And, the only to way to beat the index is to research and invest in your own set of stocks and treat them as if you own the company. If you're happy with just index returns then cheers, you have understood early and saved yourself the stress and also some time."

That drop from $344 was tactical.,"Honestly, I was rather bored by it. We all knew it was coming. There's something about $345 that makes them shit their pants. When it gets close again, expect another coordinated attack.

Are private landlords a drain on the economy?,"Separating property managers from landlords because I think it's pretty clear what value a property manager brings -- somebody has to fix the pipes, repair the AC, make sure the building passes fire inspection etc. These are all things that I as a tenant am paying money specifically so I do not have to think about them and were I a homeowner I would have to bother with them.

There are also obvious reasons why renting is good for an economy; taking myself as an example, I'm at a stage in my life where I'm moving a lot and if I couldn't rent I would be forced to buy and sell a house every time I wanted to move, which is obviously suboptimal for a lot of reasons.

But tackling the question of ""why private landlords"", the usual normative justification is that someone has to take on the risk of owning property. As a renter, if there's some property damage -- let's say a fire -- I can just move, but the landlord faces a much larger monetary loss. The landlord would likely be insured for that, but they wouldn't be insured for the pipes bursting or the AC failing, etc. So clearly there's risk in operating a rental unit and people need to be compensated for that risk in order for them to take the risk. And taking on this risk creates value. I've no interest in defending the many shitty landlords, but that's the general argument. 

But why private landlords as opposed to the government? Basically the same justification for why use markets and not to centrally plan things; it's really hard for a government to figure out where to build housing, how much to charge for it, etc (not withstanding that transitioning from private to public ownership is challenging). There are successful housing regimes with substantial government involvement ([the city of Vienna owns and operates about 25% of Vienna's housing stock](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_featd_article_011314.html), and this has had generally good outcomes for Austrian citizens), but there's a big jump from 25% to 100% of housing been owned and planned by the government."

Is there a conflict of interest between personal finance and the economy?,"The general idea that individual household prudence can be bad for the economy is absolutely correct - this is called the Paradox of Thrift, and while it was heavily popularised by Keynes (1936), it's been part of mainstream economics for a long time. Keynes himself notes that Adam Smith (1776) refers to it in The Wealth of Nations, saying ""*What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom*"", and John M. Robertson (1892) wrote a whole book called the Fallacy of Saving, saying ""*Had the whole population been alike bent on saving, the total saved would positively have been much less... industrial paralysis would have been reached sooner or oftener, profits would be less, interest much lower, and earnings smaller and more precarious. This ... is no idle paradox, but the strictest economic truth*.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The formalised version is essentially a prisoner's dilemma. There is some intertemporal balance of savings and consumption in each period which is optimal for the economy, and another one which is optimal for the individual. There is no requirement that the two are the same. Some economists bicker over how different they are, for example there are those who argue that savings represent investments and are also conducive to growth; which is not wrong, but from an intertemporal optimisation point of view, investment returns come with significant lag, so they are not optimal in each period. Consequently, no one really disputes that it would take a dramatic coincidence for the individual and collective optimums to be exactly the same even in one period for one individual, let alone in every period for every individual. This is made even worse in a recession, where greater economic uncertainty motivates higher precautionary savings, but higher savings would sink the economy into a larger hole.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the specific examples you choose to highlight though... some are more relevant than others. Overvaluation of the stock market isn't necessarily related to overinvestment, but rather inefficient allocation of investments. If the total value of investments increases dramatically, but the threshold for required returns remains the same, then there's really no change in valuations; instead, capital flows to underinvested companies, or to new opportunities. If there are no new opportunities but investment inflow continues to enter the market, that's not a problem in itself either, all it does is lower the expected market return and hence valuations continue to remain fair.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are actually a bunch more economic paradoxes; most kicking in when the economy is in a recession or otherwise impaired. The paradox of toil argues that an increase in willingness to work can have the effect of lowering wages, but if nominal interest rates are at a zero lower bound then total demand falls instead since people have lower spending power and no further available credit, workers just spend less and the economy shrinks. The paradox of flexibility argues a similar angle, but points to low wage stickiness (perhaps from having good-natured and understanding workers) making it easier for wages to fall, also causing the economy to shrink. The paradox of deleveraging focuses on banks, who when faced with economic recession, tend to reduce the risk on their balance sheet; but in so doing, tighten credit and magnify distress to the economy."
Why did the economic fallout from the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic not cause Depression-level economic devastation?,"The economy looked very different in 1918. Our modern economy has a much larger share of consumer driven activity, which is directly impacted by social distancing. 1918 had not yet mechanized nearly as much, farming was a much larger share of the economy, where social distancing has less impact on productivity."

Will taxing the rich actually cost us more?,"The question you’re asking has to do with something called “tax incidence,” if you’d like to read more. In general, it means that the tax gets passed along to whoever is least willing to change their behavior to avoid it. Cigarette sellers, for instance, may pass along taxes on them to the buyer, because addicts will buy cigarettes at any price. If an apple seller, however, hiked her prices, then perhaps people would buy oranges instead, so she pays the tax herself.

The idea that a business owner will have pass her income taxes along to you, however, seems unlikely to me for several reasons. Firstly because business income does not always, or even typically, face the same taxes as wages. Jeff Bezos, for instance, would not pay any additional taxes if income taxes over 400k were raised, since he famously pays himself 80k a year in wages.

Second, many economists believe that the super highly paid owe their incomes, in part, to economic “rents”—that is, money they make from market power rather than productive activity. If so, removing the incentives for rent-seeking, by taxing ill-gotten profits away, could actually benefit consumers. This second point is one of active research in modern economics, and more controversial, but needless to say, this Facebook post does not even begin to tackle the complex problem of tax incidence. It takes for granted one particular model of incidence, and does not even reflect the way that business taxes work in the US."

Is it possible to have a shortage of low-skilled workers resulting from everyone being educated?,"In the short run there could be a shortage of low skilled workers, but then wages rise to compensate for the low supply. 

More people in higher skilled work may decide they would prefer to work in a lower skilled profession if it means they could earn the same amount or slightly lower without the stress that can come with a more demanding profession. 

Additionally less people may be inclined to take up further education pursuing a more skilled profession if low skilled work wages rise. Same goes for those already in low skilled professions (leaving low skilled work in pursuit of higher skilled work) 

There’ll also be higher immigration into countries that see a rise in wages for low skilled work where their home countries have lower wages, improving the trade off of moving abroad for work to send funds back home."
You do not have to give your employer 2 weeks notice.,"Yeah, it's important to be aware of what the management culture is like at your company, and plan appropriately.

At a different company that was doing well, and I had a good relationship with my manager, I gave three weeks' notice. They paid me for those three weeks, plus an extra week of separation pay."

300K = 35.2%

400K = 37.7%

Don’t keep looking at price,"User civgarth who used to be a trader, had a good story:

&gt; You will always win in the long term if you just buy the broad market because it's designed to win. 

&gt; That said, if you're all in with the money you need tomorrow and you're riding out a correction, then that's on you.

&gt; Prices are by definition, 'manipulated' because traders make money on price action in **both** directions. 

&gt; A trader's job is to force the highest possible trade before changing direction, hoping to create bagholders and then generate sentiment in the opposite direction to buy back at a lower price. 

&gt; That's what they are paid to do. Algorithms are constantly learning herd behavior so they can trade ahead of it.

&gt; Investment funds exist to aggregate user money to make bets on the collective results of the world's traders, who are now mostly lines of code coded by mathematicians and statisticians. They trade on inside information and they all front-run the herd with misleading information or selective omission. As the investing public, we've all agreed that it's ok for them to cheat because they are cheating on our behalf in the form of investment savings, and pensions. We just ride the whale. For non-institutional traders like myself, we don't trade with a particular ideology. We just follow the whale. 

&gt; The funds are not 'smart' money as the media often claim. They are huge pools of money and their moves create their own gravity which affects the algos they own and benefit from. 

&gt; I apologize. They are 'smart' in the sense that they will always have information ahead of the rest of us.

&gt; I would hope that the few actively traded funds who display their trades each day have demonstrated they are not particularly 'better' at this than you. They just have more money and can keep buying the dips or calling the top until it actually happens. As I said in another post, you're not necessarily worst than someone else, you just don't have a big enough account to offset your mistakes as they do theirs.

&gt; The market will always go up because if it didn't, these folks would not be able to attract investor money. Over the decades, the market has collectively decided 7% - 12% is a good return because it's enough to attract new money into the hands of money managers and yet not high enough to discourage randos to try to beat it on their own - thus maintaining the illusion of a market. The price is the last trade, whether 100 shares or 1,000.

&gt; You will always win in the long term if you just buy the broad market because it's designed to win. That said, if you're all in with the money you need tomorrow and you're riding out a correction, then that's on you.

"Since demand for gym memberships is way down from last year, why hasn't the cost come down at all?","Because they have probably still been receiving monthly dues even though no one is going.

Dark time to be a crypto investor,This is not a hard time my friend. This is why they say only invest what your can afford to lose. The crash in 2014 was 90% almost overnight. This is a just a healthy correction for most projects. Keep DCAing into the market and bring your average cost down. You'll get through it.
Why is the news so negative about house prices dropping when this is great news for minimum wage workers like me trying to get a foot in the door?,"Part of the reason for all the negativity is the wealth effect being hit when house prices drop. People who may have no intention or interest in selling love to hear their house appreciated by $100K or so. Some may use that to refinance, draw down on equity to pay for an IP or buy a new car, or go on an overseas trip.

So when they hear their house has dropped in value by $100K, they feel poorer. Now, to go on that trip to Bali or Bermuda, they may not have enough equity to draw down. So they either have to save (many may not be doing that actively so it feels hard), or they have to pull back on their expectations- the new Porsche Cayenne will have to wait, so the old Pajero will have to keep going for a few more years.

So even though people may not be looking to sell, their lives are impacted because their options for increased consumption have been pared back.

Besides, we have a culture where home ownership is worshipped and some of the media networks have ownership in the real estate portals."
Warren Buffett Quantitative Checklist - 5000+ Stocks Rated,"I like the thinking and the list.  To differentiate a little more, it would be great to see what it would look like adding Benjamin Graham's rules from The Intelligent Investor.  I am thinking specifically of Chapter 5 ""The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks"".  The ones I would like to see are:

* Limit price over average earnings from the last 7 years to be not more than 25 times those average earnings.
* Price to Earnings not over 20 for the last 12 months earnings
* Conservatively Financed - defined by Graham as ""common stock (at book value) represents at least half of the total capitalization, including all bank debt.""
* Prominent - defined by Graham as ""company should rank among the first quarter or first third in size within its industry group"""
What is the contrarian argument for why a recession is not coming?,"Corporate earnings are very strong. There is still a shortage of people to fill jobs. The dollar has strengthened, which will drive down inflation and increase purchasing power. Banks are still in good shape and are still lending. If consumers keep on spending, and banks and corporations are still doing well, the economy may not go into recession.

Note: I personally think we will have a mild, but relatively long recession.

Also note: mild recessions are not pleasant."
Deliveroo IPO Ahoy. £50 million of shares available for Deliveroo customers.,"I thought about, and I am leaning to not investing in it. 

[On revenue of £770 million in 2019, they couldn't turn a profit.](https://www.ft.com/content/a882d2dc-fa43-4d98-a42e-c7270ddf9b44) They ended up losing £310 million on that. In other words, to break even in 2019, they would've needed revenue of £1bn+ - _to break even_.

I don't know of any other business Deliveroo is involved in bar food &amp; grocery delivery. I don't know their plans for vertical or horizontal expansion either, but nothing looks obvious.

They expect the Deliveroo app to be sticky in a lockdown-free world, because users have been trained to use the app. I think there's an argument that will happen, but not to the extent Deliveroo expect. Which brings me back to my main point: On £770 million, they couldn't turn a profit. 

I just don't feel the buzz or hype about this one.

He may be a bit out of touch with how much 1k actually is to people.

Edit: I think I'm being misinterpreted here.  I was actually saying that 1k IS a lot of money to people. To force them to spend it in 10 days seems a little absurd.  I'm sure Cuban drops 1k at dinner.

Also, yes, 100% agree 2k a month is poverty wages.  This is not a comparison to a living wage, this is extra money Cuban wants the government to send to people to just go out and spend, and force them to do it in a very limited amount of time."

You are doing the opposite of the upper class if you are panicking right now,"This is exactly where DCA implementation has it's biggest benefit,

Steady and regular investments (fixed dollar amount every month) or slight increases as your income allows means you acquire more shares for the same amount.  Over time your lower priced purchases outpace your higher priced purchases and your average cost basis per share drops."
Explain like I’m 5: how does real estate investing beat the stock market?,"Here's the math. 

The term cap rate refers to the net operating income divided by the price of the property. 

Net operating income ignores any mortgage, as that cost can fluctuate greatly based on how big of a loan is taken out. The cap rate is essentially the return you would achieve if you bought the property outright without a mortgage. I'll explain why you wouldnt do that. 

In today's market where values are high cap rates are lower, but typically still higher than the cost of a mortgage.

Let's use 8% cap rate (return) for example as that's around where I bought my last property.

 Let's see how leverage enhances those returns with a fictional example of a 100K property where we put 20K down and borrow 80K @ a 4% interest rate. 

A 100k property with an 8% cap rate will return 8k in NOI annually, and the interest on the loan will cost $3,200, for a net income of $4,800

A $4,800 net income on a 20k investment is a 24% leveraged return in your first year. If rent income increases or property value increases, so does you return. 

And that's how leverage takes an investment which produces an 8% return and turns it into a 24% return. 

US Real Estste allows you to apply a lot of leverage in a way that's not overly risky (dont get me wrong, more leverage always means more risk).

Did I succeed in ELI5? My first attempt."
Why the hell do we have rent control in various cities when economists mostly agree it’s not good?,"You are correct, rent control is widely discouraged by economists. I think the simplest answer is that policy is not set by economists, it's set by politicians and the voters that elect them. In *many* instances, politicians enact policies that most economists would advise against.

It's likely worth noting that while rent control is negative in aggregate, it can produce some winners in the process. Particularly, if you're a resident in a rent-controlled apartment, the policy may benefit you even if it's at the expense of many others. So it's entirely possible that the beneficiaries (who are current residents) may be a powerful voting group."
"Should my retired father put $2000000 all in SCHD and just collect 3%, $60000 yearly in dividends?","He definitely shouldn't sell his house in order to do this. Rent will almost certainly be more expensive than mortgage if he bought 15 years ago, and in another 15 years his living expenses will drop a ton of he keeps it.

Also, even if it's a good dividend security, putting all your eggs in one basket is only good for growth, not stability. He would need to split it up at least a little bit between some ETFs in different sectors to be safe."

"Are State Owned Companies really bad for the economy, or is it more of a problem of administration?","State-owned enterprises tend to be less profitable than private enterprises (due a variety of factors, such as their habit of over-employing workers).

One [study](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/006/1995/00000022/00000003/art00002) looked at public enterprises in the OECD, finding that ""the evidence fails to support the hypothesis of a negative relationship between [public enterprises] and economic growth.""

Similarly, a more recent [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898677) looked at SOEs in China, and found that while they are less profitable, they also generate positive spillover effects that benefit the overall economy. To quote:

&gt; Since these two effects offset each other, the contribution of SOEs to economic growth in China during our sample time frame was not significantly different from that of non-state enterprises.

There is also some evidence that SOEs can [improve health](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020731419833530) and [reduce inequality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062940818303681), while privatization is associated with [lower wages](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3278753#:~:text=Following%20privatization%2C%20wages%20for%20incumbent,to%20within-establishment%20wage%20changes.) (an effect which spills over throughout the labor market). One [meta-analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apce.12092?casa_token=L-2VjCbz21MAAAAA%3Aj6AElLw46DgBTn3bd3Ld2LGxvdwGPmg2e53zOSD4rSsPvjxOxoG_rdLokLoz2NfocsXZ_K6ONaPvgQHn9Q) from 2015 found that, when these other factors (such as social externalities) are taken into account, ""there is no support for the claim that private enterprises have better performance ceteris paribus than public enterprises.""

As such, determining whether they are ""bad for the economy"" is a bit more ambiguous than the issue of mere profitability; there are other factors to take into account. Applying market logic and competition to them will likely improve their overall profitability, however. Competition does tend to spur greater efficiency, as a general rule."

"Wikipedia has a section arguing that supply and demand isn't real, or no longer applies. Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?","&gt;Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?

No. But we can expand on that a bit.

Supply and demand is a model. Models are approximations of reality. Whether a model is a good approximation of realty in any specific application depends on how well the particular market you're studying lines up with the assumptions of the model. For example, S&amp;D assumes that (a) everyone knows what they're buying, (b) every firm in the market is selling basically the same good, and (c) there are many buyers and sellers, so that no one customer or firm has outsized influence on the good's price. Some markets satisfy those conditions; others do not.

Supply and demand is a general framework that can be used to study a wide variety of market phenomena. However, if you are studying a specific market at a specific time in a specific place, then you might want to use a more detailed model that better conforms to the application under investigation.

There is an entire field of economics, *industrial organization,* that studies the behavior of supply in situations where the assumptions of supply and demand are not a good approximation for reality. This includes situations in which there are few competitors (monopoly, oligopoly); situations in which competitors compete on brand (monopolistic competition), situations in which one firm's actions depend on the actions of others (game theory), etc. All of these models allow for a more detailed analysis than simple S&amp;D. 

Usually S&amp;D should be the first place you go to solve your problem, but not necessarily the last place. You can use S&amp;D to get coarse answers to most questions, and more detailed models to get richer answers. 

-----

Regarding the two criticisms you mentioned:

1. S&amp;D is not a tautology; classical consumer and producer theory produces implications that can be tested against data. However, S&amp;D *is* a very general framework (by design), so it can accommodate a rather wide range of behavior.

2. Under supply and demand, firms set price equal to marginal cost. There is no markup, and no profit. This is an extreme prediction. In most richer industrial organization models, firms set price equal to a markup over marginal cost. The size of the markup is a key object of interest in IO, and usually can be linked to demand parameters or other such primitives. But it's not necessarily ""fixed."" Furthermore, in many IO models, the size of the markup falls as the number of competitors grows large -- so S&amp;D is the ""limit"" as the number of competitors grows.

  You can even use these richer models to put bounds on how good the S&amp;D approximation is; for example, some models allow claims such as ""for any industry with more than 10 competitors, the S&amp;D-predicted price will be within 10% of the more complicated model's predicted price."" Such bounds can be helpful, and put S&amp;D in its proper context. I wouldn't say these results ""invalidate"" S&amp;D, they just provide a richer model of the price-setting environment.

So, again, S&amp;D is usually a good first stab at most problems at a high level, and the answers one obtains can be refined by using more advanced models. There are famous cases where the S&amp;D answer and the more complicated model's answer are totally different (such as the case of price controls), but those are famous in part because they're rare.

Think of models less in terms of, ""is the model right or wrong,"" and more, ""is it more or less useful in this particular situation?"" or, ""is it more or less useful in giving reasonable answers in a broad range of situations?"""

Do the billionaires actually have the money?,"We'll take your Jeff Bezos example. The majority of Bezos's fortune is held in Amazon stock. If Bezos wanted to turn his stock into cash, he would simply sell his Amazon stock. However, because he owns such a large amount of Amazon stock, if he decided to dump all of it at once, it would hurt Amazon's share price and lower his net worth in the process. So he'd have to sell it very slowly over time to realise it's full value, assuming the stock price held stable over this time period which is a big assumption. If you taxed his wealth highly enough, then you'd see him have to devalue Amazon stock by selling off enough shares to cover the tax burden."
"Homes are selling insanely fast, with some going $1-200k over asking price. What does that mean for the future?","So when you say another ""major bust"" I suspect that you might be thinking of another 2008 style crash. It's important to note that there can be a decrease in home values without the broader economic effects that we saw in 2008.

In 2008 there essentially was a lot of things that in one way or another were relying on the fact that home values could only go up. There were a lot of risky mortgages being given out to people who could only afford them by cashing in on rising home prices. Securitization of these loans along with very poor credit ratings led a lot of the financial industry to be exposed to these loans without realizing the risk involved, and the entire economy is very exposed to the financial industry. Eventually new construction responded to the boom in the housing market, which leveled out prices and then the house of cards described above started to collapse.

Contrast that with now. There are many causes and it's hard to pinpoint the exact magnitude but they appear to be different than what we saw then.

First is low inventory. While the housing market appears to be booming, there's actually not many people selling their home right now. This is most likely because people don't want to move during a pandemic. 

Then there's higher savings rates. While the pandemic hit many people hard economically, many others are able to (and almost forced to) save more now than ever. Many of the things people normally spend on (travel, entertainment, commuting costs) are no longer there. Add some government assistance like stimulus checks as a bonus and many people are racking up savings. This is very different than 2008 where [savings was very low](https://web.archive.org/web/20071217193831/http://www.bea.gov/briefrm/saving.htm) and it was fueled by lending. There's a lot of cash offers being thrown around and no indication that banks are loosening their lending requirements.

Another factor is the pandemic changing what markets are desirable. Many people can now work from anywhere, and cities have many aspects shut down or limited so people want to move to places further from their office where they can have more space. This leads to excess demand in places that never had this level of demand before.

The point of all this is to say that there's not much of an indication of systemic risk in any of these explanations we see. This is a short term trend currently, and the low volume means not many people actually paid these prices. Furthermore, people seem to be able to afford these prices and have a sufficient amount of equity in these houses, banks don't seem to be overly exposed. 

If the housing market corrected tomorrow back to 2019 levels, we would likely see a small minority of homeowners underwater (those who bought at the peak 2020 levels) and they would likely take the losses themselves rather than us seeing 2008 levels of foreclosures. For everyone else, they would be in the same place as before the pandemic (with regard to their home value). The trend could also continue as several of the reasons listed above could be lasting changes.

There could be a systemic risk exposed with a sudden correction in housing prices, but that's not readily apparent in the time being. I know this rambled quite a bit but the main point I was trying to get at is that the housing market can go up and down -- even quite dramatically -- and it doesn't mean there has to be giant rippling effects across the economy."

They brought me here at age 5.    So I am an immigrant too.

America is the greatest country in the world -- not perfect but better than any other.  Find another country as vigorously supportive of free speech as the USA.  None, my friend.  None.

My journey included Ivy league education and top 10 MBA program.  Was a very good student but not the best -- they are truly geniuses around.  I was single minded though and intellectually curious enough to achieve and honor my parents -- they sacrificed so much for me and my sibling. I could not let them down.  It is the way for all children of motivated immigrants, regardless of skin color, etc.

This thinking suggests impostor syndrome or some other self conscience thoughts that you are not worthy because RACE.

You are more than your skin color.   Escape non-productive introspection.  Open and embrace the world you live in and the neighbors/coworkers/bosses who value you.  If it doesn't work out, move!  i am not saying racism or cultural ignorance does not exist but it's a lot better society than decades ago.  Share yourself more too in this society.

"""$15 minimum wage would reduce poverty but cost jobs, CBO says."" My question is, are fewer jobs necessarily a bad thing?","It isn't necessarily bad, no. But it depends. I do not think many labor economists would endorse the story you describe, however.

It's more like this. It turns out, people who take minimum wage jobs tend to have high employment churn rates, meaning they may hold a number of jobs throughout the year, but not holding any job for very long. Think being employees at job A for 3 months, then being unemployed for a month, then having job B for 4 months, then having no job for 2 months, etc.

Given the above, what happens if unemployment goes up a little bit? Well, rather then a specific set of full time employed workers losing their jobs and staying unemployed throughout the year, a more typical result would be for people going from 9mo employed throughout the year to 8mo (or however many months) employed throughout the year. And in that case, so long as the wage increase is large enough, it can offset the reduction in unemployment for each person such that they come out ahead in terms of annual earnings.

Of course, for a large enough increase in unemployment, this math doesn't come out favorably for workers. And for large unemployment increases, like during the great recession, you do see people become long term unemployed - that's basically the case where you go from working however much to not working at all all year long.

As for your initial theory, that people may simply be choosing to work less because their incomes are higher. This is a phenomenon to some extent, but it is offset by the phenomenon that people may wish to work more when higher wages are offered. My recollection is that there isn't any good evidence that income effects (the labor econ phrase for the effect of having more money on your willingness to work) are substantially negative in this income range.

As a final note, I would mention that the cbo report has an idiosyncratically large estimate of the impact of minimum wages on employment that is larger than the largest negative estimates promoted by the minority of labor economists who think that minimum wages increases have a notable negative effect on employment. It's a bit hard to explain how they got to it as well. They seem to have done a mini lit review, gotten to an unusually large estimate, and then multiplied it by one and a half for no particular good reason."

What the hell to do with 10M€,"I'd spend a few thousand to speak to 3-4 different financial advisers, with a focus on (1) tax and (2) ensuring returns that fit your risk appetite and goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd stay away from financial advisers who manage your money or refer you to specific companies, money managers or friends. I'd get their advice (it's usually by the book, good stuff), but I'd avoid paying them annual fees to manage your stuff. If you do wish this, specifically seek out a fiduciary in Spain (or elsewhere you may have a domicile of some sort, some countries like the US where a fiduciary is legally bound to represent your best  interests take it quite seriously).

&amp;#x200B;

The important thing is to consider what your goals are. If it's wealth preservation, wealth building, inheritance, donations etc, you have to find some.

&amp;#x200B;

The easiest bet is to just put everything on an all-world stock ETF in my opinion. You can expect about 8% a year, or 800k on 10 million. At your age of 45 and given your earnings and wealth are so much larger than what you need, you can easily manage the volatility of the market without being impacted, and stocks remain the highest returning asset class. You could keep spending 200k (2%) a year and never see the money run out, especially not if you're going to be making that in earnings from your salary. Then decide on donating and writing a will, a little later in the next few years as you get more comfortable and knowledgeable."

"Are high taxation policies in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden (or just Sweden) causing rich people to leave Scandinavia, if they are leaving?","No, the primary reaction to a wealth tax is not to leave a country. While some people might move within a country's states, it's less convenient to move internationally. Slemrod's (1990) hierarchy shows the primary reaction of the wealthy is to evade and avoid taxes. This recent study by Sleim (2017) [with almost 51 million observations in a seven-year panel of taxpayers finds that this is what seems to be happening in Sweden](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150290). The study concludes: ""The findings are consistent with the hierarchy of behavioral tax responses proposed by Slemrod (1990, 1995), conjecturing that households will respond in real terms only as a measure of last resort, should avoidance or evasion opportunities prove limited."" The article also argues about how the wealthy expose Sweden's loopholes to remain inside Sweden. 

If these loopholes didn't exist, Slemrod (2001) argues the wealthy are likely to use offshore resources : ""[To the extent that the cost of shifting reported income is reduced by having real operations in a low-tax country, the shifting opportunity proves an implicit subsidy to real investment in that low-tax country.](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/46124/10797_2004_Article_325226.pdf?sequence=1)"" 

To answer your question more directly, think about the Panama papers. Was the issue that wealthy people were physically leaving their country to live in Panama? The wealthy in high-tax countries could go and live in any low-tax country right now but **choose** to live in high-tax countries. For the wealthy to pay their share of taxes, the governments can and should continue closing loopholes by enforcing and regulating new policies."

The stock market is roughly at the same place it was pre-Covid. Isn't that a huge red flag?,"I am not going to argue you on what will happen. In other words, I am not saying you are wrong, but you aren't right either. Truely, we don't know.


As a counter point:


&gt;The lost economic activity is directly from people not being able to work. It isn't value being lost on a balance sheet when investments fail. 


How do you think this makes it better or worse? I could phrase this point differently making the now look much less worse than 2008; ""Now we have a temporary reduction of value, whilst in 2008 investors found out value they assumed to be there for years *really wasn't there*""


&gt; Those problems seem solvable by pumping extra money into the system to get through the temporary disturbances. This seems different. This is people literally not producing value and that lost value is never going to come back.


Why do you think those problems are more easily solved than these? Right now, the question is whether it is just a liquidity problem, or its more than that.


&gt; This is people literally not producing value and that lost value is never going to come back.

I am not going to speculate on the market, and I have data for neither, but I agree that this is a problem which colloquially is underestimated.


Let us get back to the question of what the problem exactly is here. Indeed, value has been lost which does not return -- but the question is *where* this productivity was lost. 


Let us imagine a situation where we have perfect information, as a lawmaker. You may agree that the magnitude of damage will differ per sector. The damage will be largest where close-contact is inevitable but the sector is not vital (restaurants, concerts, sports). Damage will be smaller in retail, further smaller in manufacturing, even smaller in food production, etc.


Then, what in a positive scenario will be the consequences? For restaurants and the likes, either many will go bankrupt or they will be provided temporary liquidity. If they get provided liquidity, they should be grand -- labour/rent costs could be lowered (as this is a sector-wide problem) and profits will be high when the economy opens (people have more savings and may be more inclined to go out for dinner, but there will not suddenly be more supply).


If many go bankrupt, those remaining will have abnormal profits afterwards (due to the same reasons), and may expand, or new companies will be introduced by investors. Still, this is much less optimal, as the job losses there may cause a wrinkle effect (waiters lose jobs, order less, lower wages/more unemployment other sectors, less demand for restaurants - you get the drift).  As a lawmaker, if we have this information, we may be inclined to provide incentives to make sure that these firms receive loans or capital (or do so yourself) as these loans can probably be repaid and it will severely limit the damage. This suggests that the damage may be largely negated.


Furthermore, we will, partially, see a shift. Not just a crash. If you keep earning the same, you may just change consumption patterns, or consume similar products in a different manner. Think of sports. Those who visit their team every week will not be able to do so, but will be inclined to watch from home, and may even spend more on merchandise or upgrading their TV and the likes. If one sector suffers and the other increases (where jobs will be created) this may reduce economic loss.


If we simplify it very much (obviously, it is not a binary but a spectrum), we can either envision a spiral (as in the waiters example) or a bump (as in, everything will return back to normal). Then, if we think of the second, do the losses not matter? Well, obviously, they do. The question then again is, however, where did we see the losses? The sectors I just mentioned, if we assume those will be most affected, are less crucial to the long-term growth path. This is logical as well; let us assume for a second that factories randomly start collapsing globally - that has a larger effect, as, once everything is over, you can not just go back to work. Right now, the idea is that, as long as we keep a relatively OK amount of firms alive, the infrastructure is there and we can just begin producing again at some point. So yes, its value which is not coming back, but its one-off value which is not coming back. This is also how it is different from the 2008 crisis; investors had investments which were expected to grant certain ROI's over the course of many years, which were suddenly valueless. The drop may be larger now, but is assumed to be short term.


Last, stock is always a relative, both on a micro and a macro scale. Sure, Apple may experience set-backs in their R&amp;D as they have to close their physical locations, but if this loss is the same for all competitors, there may not be a large effect on long-term profitability. On a macro scale, yields on bonds and other investments in general are low, so even if parties do not assume huge booms, they may be rational in making investments.


Now, I am not saying that the market is right or wrong in this. If you are a 100% certain either way, enjoy your retirement in the Bahama's. That said, the movement of the stock market is not that unexpected. We would expect one big shock in which the market first prices in their first bet of how big the losses will be + their uncertainty, and then we see slow adaptation on the basis of new information. Apparently the market now thinks that these shocks will be relatively short-run, and see it as a valuable investment as returns everywhere else are low as well."

U.S. population barely grows; annual housing construction is 1.5 million. So how did we end up in a housing shortage? Is the market distorted by tax code?,"I'm not an economist but already can see some math questions/corrections:

1. U.S. population grew by 1,912,422. Which is obviously greater than 1,500,000 in housing construction
2. granted, some of that population growth likely happened in existing families/homes
3. but, you can't also assume that old homes weren't destroyed or unusable for whatever reason (e.g. natural disasters, etc.), so there's likely a net increase of less than 1,500,000 new homes.

And if people aren't many people looking to move (due to pandemic, poor job prospects, etc.), then the amount of \*sellable\* homes may have decreased, thus increasing the price of existing homes."

The Prisoner's Dilemma shattered: Why I think the MOASS will happen,"You have it the wrong way around: for apes it isn't the *prisoner's dilemma* but more like a *stag hunt* or *prisoner's delight*, two lesser known problems from the scientific field of game theory: Our odds are much, much better than in the prisoners dilemma.

**The truth is that  the shorties are in a prisoner's dilemma, because only the first one to cover has a chance of survival.**


Edit: there are some posts that explain it better, but here's how I understand the *stag hunt* (copied from my other comment) 

In the *stag hunt*, the participants can either agree to a common strategy and catch the stag (i.e. the squeeze) or they can choose to individually just catch a squirrel instead (i.e wait for the long term success of gamestop).

The US spends 23% budget on healthcare but U.K. spends 20% so how can the latter afford universal healthcare but the US can’t ?,"This discussion is not meaningful without also including R&amp;D and expenditures on prescription drugs. The US leads spending in both categories. I suspect there is significant free rider issues between the US and the rest of the world. The question I have is whether the world’s health care degrades as a consequence of the US moving to a Medicare for all model. 

There are clear and distinct problems with the incentive structures for healthcare in the US. They are difficult to solve but there should be a ton of effort to resolve them. Because they exist there are a ton of inefficiencies that exacerbate cost without adding value. 

I think the best thing the US could do is fix these issues to get the most efficient prices, allow insurance companies to offer discreet insurance products related to the direct cost to insure and individual (i.e. a rider if you smoke, a discount if you can run an 8 minute mile), and subsidize those individuals that need help getting insured. That would result in a more efficient model than a medicare for all solution. I would expect total healthcare costs to fall and outcomes to be better. 

One thing that you don’t want to impact by healthcare reform, is the fact that, in terms of quality of care, the US is the undisputed leader. If you have a difficult condition, you’re best off being treated in the US unless you need an experimental treatment that’s banned by the FDA."

The Fallacy of taking bigger risks when you are young,"I think you are misunderstanding the meaning of ""take bigger risks when you are young"".

* **Hot Take** – *Holy Shit!* There be whales here. If the Ethereal summit is about the possibilities and the applications of blockchain, this is about the investing, the money, the economics, and even more money. It costs $1700 to attend this shindig, which is a drop in the hat considering people here are major players. With notable names representing bitcoin, ripple, and other blockchain technologies, I believe this is event can separate the men from the boys, and demonstrate how Ethereum can out-perform its competition. Expect buyers if this goes well.


# **Next Week 05/25/2017 – [Token Summit]( http://tokensummit.com/)**

* **Notable Speakers** – Muneeb Ali (Blockstack), Erik Voorhees (ShapeShift), Our boy Fred Wilson (Union Square Ventures), Shawn Wilkinson (Storj)

* **Notable Sponsors** – ShapeShift, ICONOMI

* **Conference Brief** - Token Summit is the first event that will explore the economics, regulation and best practices around blockchain-based tokens, protocols, and crypto-assets. If you are an entrepreneur, investor, finance professional, lawyer, fund manager, regulator, or business executive, you should start paying attention to the emerging token-based economy, one that might rival the web in terms of potential innovation, new business models and entrepreneurial ideas that are yet to be deployed. Join us at this exclusive, intellectually-driven gathering, grouping the best minds in this space.

* **Hot Take** – After all the big names earlier in the week at Consensus, this may seem like a drop in the bucket. Plus, Brian Armstrong is going to be exhausted too after pushing Token at his 3rd Summit in 6 days. But this seems to be mostly for the developers and entrepreneurs who are going to build off of the big names in blockchain. It aims at those who are innovating with lessons how to launch an ICO, comply with future laws, and connect with the landscape of investment funds. This is knowledge sharing and I hope ETH is at the center of it all. 
"
And now we wait,"&gt; Sometimes it feels like the movie Click where I just want to hit fast forward 10-15 years to get the destination where I’ll feel like I truly have control over my life without money dictating where I live and how I spend 10+ hours a day.

To be blunt, this is one of the most depressing statements I’ve seen in this subreddit lately. 

If your life has become such that you’re having fantasies about skipping the next decade and a half, that should be a huge red flag.

You can’t get these years back. If you’re semi-miserable (or even fully miserable) up until age 45-50, you’re not going to suddenly flip the retirement switch and become a happy, fulfilled person with a rich personal life. The trajectories you set for yourself now are going to become entrenched in your life, your habits, your relationships, and your social circle.

You already have a great financial foundation. It sounds like what you need now is to work on fixing (yes, fixing) your lifestyle and work/life balance. Even if it means giving up some of that HHI. You won’t regret making life changes such that decades of your prime, healthy years are enjoyable rather than so dreadful that you wish you could be sedated through them.

Also, I’d you’re in your 30s and plan on having kids, it’s probably time to start moving on that ASAP. I started having kids mid 30s with good health and fitness at the time but it was still more taxing than if I had been in my early 30s or late 20s. If I had been in worse physical shape or waited until 40, it would have meaningfully detracted from the experience for myself and my kids. I haven’t known anyone who had kids later than about mid-20s who regretted having kids too early, but I’ve seen a lot of professional peers lament waiting too long to have kids for reasons that seem illogical in retrospect."
Why do doctors and nurses have such terrible work-life balance when they have such a high skill set and are in-demand in the healthcare labor market?,"A lot of the work-life balance complaints are from residents/fellows, who are not really full doctors yet in some sense, they are still in training.

These residents make far less than your average doctor. They work long shifts to, I think, reduce the shift handover rate.

What dictates this behavior are higher ups, who rely on their relatively cheap labor. The residents must stay in this system because without completing a residency or fellowship or what have you, they will not get the stamp of approval to practice on their own/make the proverbial Big Bucks, etc."
[ETH Daily Discussion] - 21/May/2017,"I am never going to be able to invest in equities again. Look at it this way.  when Snapchat was offered by investment bankers this year to the public, It was after  angel investors bought in way way cheaper and are cashing out to sell to the public.  This has always been one of my biggest beefs in investment banking. Only the ultra rich get to invest in the top companies. It is a monopoly, yet the average man does not realize it. On ipo investments, if you are offered an ipo it is because the top 1% did not want it. With that said the average man does not know how to properly value risk on startups.

* **On the peak all time high $GME FTD day, Oct 13th** (wasn't a Friday but bring on the ""feels like Spooktober in July""-memes?): when $GME was trading at $11, the people selling $GME collectively had to deal with a $38 million problem of needing $GME shares to fulfill sales that had already been completed.

"Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved.","* WallStreetBets has never been anything but the megaphone on this.  There are certainly retail investors buying, but they're not what's moving the stock.  That's hedge funds and other institutional investors throwing their money behind the megaphone.

* Don't discount emotional investing in the short-term.  At the end of the day, stock price is a supply and demand issue.  There's a supply of shares.  There's a demand for shares.  Where those two intersect you find the price.  Typically, demand for a stock is based upon the perceived fundamentals of the company.  But that's not the only thing that can affect demand.  And you can make a lot of money identifying those other sources of demand.

* I don't know what percentage it is, but there are certainly *some* retail investors in GME that look at it *only* as an emotional investment.  They honestly don't care about the money.  They think they're making some kind of Occupy Wall Street political statement and will basically not sell at any price."

Are billionaires actually a problem,"&gt; What am I missing or is there no fundamental problem with billionaires?

From an income distribution perspective billionaires are pretty irrelevant representing an extreme outlier that politicians like using as an excuse for tax policy (in both directions). Depending on the level of corruption (NB - corruption doesn't just mean bribes, its policy influence in general) in a country they can be created due to extractive policies but these tend to be fairly obvious.

While the $1t in income more than $1m earned each year would certainly be a useful source of revenue to combat deficits and the demographic wall facing us its not enough. For the broad based social welfare systems we have, and want to increase, we need broad based tax increases so we look like the rest of the world (the US has low rates of income tax but currently extremely progressive, they need to be higher rates and less progressive). 63% of filers are between $50k and $500k but tax increases for most of those are out of the question politically.

&gt; On the consumer side I wouldn’t think they would trigger much inflation outside of stocks since their consumption for food, cars etc. are similar to a working class consumer.

Inflation occurring because people have excess income which they are spending instead of saving is a good thing, its generally not harmful to other consumers as an increase in demand for goods also increases demand for labor (higher wages). This is also why immigration is a net positive across most income groups.

One good tax policy for the wealthy is smarter &amp; better estate tax design to avoid large inheritances which would have an outsized effect on intergenerational mobility (if you are concerned with inequality this is primarily where policy should be focused). You want to encourage them to spend as much as they can while alive, tax as much as you can after they die (estate taxes are in a fairly unique part of tax policy of having extremely low distortionary costs if designed correctly) but avoid taxing in a way that causes privately owned businesses to break up.

On the last point this has been one of the most significant challenges of design to date. If someone dies and they own a private corporation if the estate tax is high enough those inheriting the business would have to sell or dissolve the business to pay estate taxes which is not a desirable outcome. Creating a loophole for private businesses would just mean the wealthy would move their capital in to a private business to avoid the taxes but large privately owned businesses dissolving is extremely disruptive."

Can someone explain this cottage industry of buying/selling cheap raw desert land?,"&gt;Sucker born every minute.

That's the attitude which drives this kind of sale. Let me explain how this all works, it's very simple.

* Owner lists the land under a land contract. Common prices are like $300-$500 down, payments over 5 years  30 years, blah blah blah.
* A desperate individual online is up late at night looking t properties they cannot afford, until they find these lots. $2,000 for a sunny spot in California?? I could put solar out there and grow food! BOOM, purchase is made sight unseen.
* Payments are set up. Scenario 1 is that the seller has good docs and sent it all to the county, and has an escrow account set up between the two of them. Scenario 2, the good ole boy way, with a handshake and nod, and wry smile. No protection for the buyer, nd many have been screwed this way.
* Buyer goes out to the land, and ""tries"". This means they will take a long road trip with some supplies, and no experience. They will usually go out there to camp. 99  times out 100, there will be no building out there once they see the land.
* They go home with major doubts. It starts to sink in that running electric will cost ten thousand dollar. The soil is only 1"" thick with lava beds underneath. The water is poisoned with bromine, and you need to drill through granite for 500'. There's no chance of cell service or and data...
* So they default.
* Owner seizes their property from the buyer who just wants the nightmare to be over at this point.
* Owner rinses and repeats.

There are whole subdivisions like this across the US, but mostly in the Western half. Look up the San Luis Valley in S. Colorado, or some subdivisions in southern Arizona, as well as Northern California. You can literally buy a few acres of worthless land for $2-$15k. 

I was interested in buying up a few hundred acres and putting wind towers out there. There was no grid within 20 miles. The ""soil"" was loose gravel over lava. You would need to blast rock, just to put ground anchors in for a tower! 

There's one out by me. The ground is basically bedrock, and slopes down to a river. So there is no chance of septic out there, but buyers have no idea until they go and take a shit..."

Hello to the people from r/all! DO NOT use Robinhood!!,"Currently, Robinhood is under the magnifying glass of regulatory entities for their actions in January, and their heavy reliance on Payment For Order Flow (PFOF), which is the practice of having other institutions pay them for your data. Even PFOF is being questioned on it's ethicacy.

Furthermore, Robinhood is not a large broker, and will likely not be able to stay up and running through the entirety of a volatile market event. Brokers such as Fidelity, manage trillions of dollars in assets, and have enough cash to tank such an event. A simple Google search will show you that Robinhood frequently has trouble staying live during high volatility. Recently with dog coins, and previously with other securities like Tesla. 

Computershare is a transfer agent that operates similarly to a broker. You are able to buy, sell, and hold securities here. The difference is that the shares are in your name rather than your brokers name. This means you have more autonomy over your ability to purchase and sell securities. Computershare is also the transfer agent for GameStop, which means that if there is a dividend, NFT or cash, you will receive said dividend through them. Brokers cannot guarantee the distribution of non-cash dividends."
Can people in rich countries really be told to be grateful because they are rich by global standards?,"[Anand and Segal (2017)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/Assets/Documents/Working-Papers/Working-Paper-8-Who-are-the-Global-Top-1.pdf) find that the threshold to be in the top 1 percent (edit: as of 2012) is $50,600 *per person in a household*, so around $150,000 for a family of three. This puts only 7.7% of the US population in the global top 1%. The figure of $32,400 was based on different data with less coverage of the richest people in the world, and so is probably an underestimate. But that figure was also per person in a household, so $97,200 for a family of 3 would be the threshold.

On the other hand, 60.7% of Americans are in the top *ten* percent of income according to the same figures. The threshold for that is only $15,300 per person, $46,000 for a family of three. And that is adjusted for cost of living, because it uses [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rates. The fact is that there are billions of people in the world who are poorer than the median American, or even Americans below the poverty line. 

That doesn't mean it's not justified for Americans to complain about their wages. Poor or middle-class Americans might have more income than most other people in the world, but if they're not earning as much as they could be with different government policy or employer behavior, there's no reason why they shouldn't complain about that."

Aside from the formal channel, the Discord server on the back end (now branded ""The Capitalists"" last I checked) has routinely been cited by Discord as problematic for TOS breaking content, and is similarly run by heterodox individuals.

What do 1% people owning 90% of the wealth spend it on? How do they use it?,"I manage investments for mega wealthy guy. Majority of the capital goes to build out the portfolio in a traditional sense… cash/currency, commodities, equity, real estate, private co investments, funds, special investments, etc. This is not spend as much as deployment.

A lot of “normal” spend goes to maintaining these assets, like injections, maintenance, tax, lawyers/advisors, staff (our team/building).

There are more personal bits like: pet projects, “emotional” real estate, charity, lifestyle (cars, boats, aircraft), needs of extended family, hobbies, kids endeavors. 

We use a lot of the dividend income to support the spend, whilst using capital appreciation (growing and realizing investments) to invest and build it up. 

Pretty sure that’s a routine approach, my guy is actually very down to earth and pretty clinical in keeping his wealth like a business. Nothing overly complex, just cool head."

What exactly is Capitalism?,"&gt; I know this sounds like a stupid question....

No it doesn't, not at all.

&gt; A quick search leads you to some simple answers like private ownership of goods and properties along with Individual trade and commerce. But hasn't this by and large always been the case in human society? Ancient Romans owned land and goods. You could go up to an apple seller and haggle a price for apples. What exactly about Capitalism makes it relatively new and different?

This is the problem. The term ""Capitalism"" was created by people who declared themselves to be critics of Capitalism. They also tried to define it as something fairly new. At least something that happened after ~1600. But, as you point out trade and ownership are ancient in origin (as is money). It is remarkably hard to come up with a definition of Capitalism that's really satisfactory.

Let's think about what's necessary to make Capitalism something modern, something that happened after the year 1600. That rules-out lots of things. Trade can't be the defining factor, that's ancient. Money can't be the defining factor either, that's also ancient. The same is true of private property. The inequality of private property is also ancient. In many past societies there was landowners and merchants who owned lots of property, while the common people owned very little.

Some would reach for slavery or serfdom. The idea here is that Capitalism is defined by markets and private property, but also by the *lack* of slavery. This also doesn't really work. Nearly always, in ancient societies there was slavery. Similarly, there was something like serfdom in most Manorial societies (as far as I know). But, sometimes it wasn't commonplace. So, if only a tiny population of slaves exist in a place how can that mean that it's not Capitalist?

Another criteria that people advocate is wage labour. The idea here is that there's Capitalism if workers are paid wages. Payment through wages is an old idea and the Romans had salaries. Also, places without market economies still had wages, such as the USSR. We can imagine a world much like our own with no wages. Businesses pay people for specific acts of work, not by the hour. Each person is a small business (a sole-trader). In such a world there would still be markets and money. Rich people could still be rich because they could rent out things to others (e.g. property and machinery).

Economists tend not to use the word Capitalism so much because of the problems of defining it."

"$245,000~ is SCHD","Doesn't sound realistic to me... If you bought SCHD at inception (2012) and held during a strong bull market with low rates, your dividend income would have grown at a 15.6% CAGR. This is factoring in DRIP, no taxes, and 0 additional contributions.

$250k invested into SCHD at inception would have paid $33.4k worth of dividends in 2022. If we project out 10 years into the future and simply say that dividend income will keep growing 15% per year, we finish with $135k/year over a 20 year period. (still pretty good)

But even if we assume favorable market conditions for the next 20 years, can we really expect that dividend income to keep compounding at 15% per year? And even if it does, that's still nowhere near $900k... 

You'd need about a 26% CAGR for 20 years to turn today's SCHD dividend into $900k."
Anyone looking to sell their Bitcoin read this first,"Contrarian opinion, I guess? Don't put all your eggs in one basket. We know that there isn't enough bitcoin for everyone, and we also know that bitcoin is not designed to scale for everyone, and the people that run bitcoin have no interest in fixing that. Diversify.

All I'm saying is, what goes up must come down, and if you think that Bitcoin as you know it today is the financial system foundation of 200 years from now, I've got some waterfront property in Kansas you might be interested in. Lots of people are making money right now, and I've been through lots of boom and bust cycles in a few short years since Bitcoin was born.

My biggest regret isn't failing to hodl. My biggest regret is failing to recognize when it is time to cash out, time and time again. Don't forget to save something for the buffet! If you keep enough cash on hand, you can even try to buy the dip once in a while. Panic buying at all time high is not a winning strategy (except when it is.)"

If your looking for somewhere to get trade/investment ideas, personally I find the LSE a great resource. Usually I go through one of two routes:

Ethereum &amp; the Hodlors that love them,"Some thoughts:


- on ZK-Snarks: Implementation of some prerequisite features to enable ZK-snarks was planned. But do we have confirmation that actually everything will be implemented? Also, private transactions will not be as straightforward as it sounds. Creation of custom tokens for that purpose is required, as far as I understand it. So even if all the groundwork is laid, I have severe doubt that upon release there will be convenient privacy features available to the average end user.

- ice age: Afaik it will be reset with the metropolis release because Casper will take more time.


- staking: Depending on how much Eth is staked, the rewards may be significantly lower than suggested here. Also, people talk about staking pools like they they are a sure thing. While being a logical consequence on the surface, there may be quite some hurdles to overcome, imho. Would you trust all your Ether to some third party or smart contract that you didn't write or are able to verify?

- raiden/payment channels: This will provide some/lots of scaling in the case of frequent/recurring payments between to parties. However, I can see no benefit for one-off transactions.

So...How Do We Prepare for WW3?,"I have some stupid suggestions...

Make sure your bicycle is in good condition. Tires, chain, bearings, seat, and brakes. It's an easily fixed, low maintenance, inexpensive way to get around that doesn't use fuel. 

Get some trash cans, grow potatoes in them. Potatoes are easy to grow, and they're energy-dense. 

Canned goods are a good idea. This may seem obvious, but make sure you have a non-electric can opener. 

Water filters might not be a bad idea. 

This is a weird one, but consider buying or making a metal box that is large enough to put your phone, computer, etc into. This box should have a ground strap that can be attached to a metal grounding rod that can be driven into the ground. On the same note, you can purchase solar panels that will trickle charge a car battery, which can be used to charge phones/laptops/flashlights/cordless tools.

Learn to make soap. Stock up on lye. Soap is something people expect to just *have*, and it might be good to trade. Soapmaking is cheap to get into."

Are developed countries 'exporting' pollution to poor countries?,"Yes, in theory this makes a lot of sense.

Why would Musk buy more than 51%?,"Control over a company isn't binary, but exists on a spectrum. References to ownership here are by voting power, not economic interest, because lots of companies have dual-class shares. While 51% ownership guarantees a significant amount of control, a much smaller ownership, even under 5% at times, allows disproportionate influence, whereas other decisions need to be passed by a supermajority of 2/3 or 3/4 of votes, depending on the company's articles.

However, I believe the general facts aren't as pertinent here as the specific history of Elon Musk, who has been at loggerheads with the SEC, the regulator of listed securities in the US. Even if he were to own 90% of the shares, if the remaining 10% were listed on a US stock exchange, he'd be bound by their regulations in a way that he wouldn't if the company were to go private. This would apply to any company going private, but I think it is of disproportionate importance to Musk. 

As for the second part, shares don't get “on the market” unless the owner gives the specific order to the broker to sell. What happens most of the time is that these transactions, for tiny fractions of a company's shareholding, are conveyed to the stock exchange. However, when you want to buy a massive chunk of the shareholding, up to and including all of it, it becomes a lot easier and cheaper (edit: and sometimes necessary; see below) to make a tender offer, wherein you announce the number of shares and price per share you're soliciting (kind of similar to regular trades via the exchange, but much more formal and involved). Shareholders then subscribe to your offer if they want to sell at your price, rather than placing a sell order on the exchange. If he were just to buy shares off the market, he would be restricted to buying the shares that shareholders wanted to sell (at prevailing prices) anyway, rather than specifically informing them of his intention.

It becomes necessary to make a tender offer because there are regulations in place regarding a minimum proportion of the company's shares (here, by economic interest, not voting power, I think) to be owned by shareholders not affiliated with or able to directly influence the management. Called ‘free float’, this minimum is 20% in the US, which means that Musk would not be able to perform what's known as a creeping acquisition, buying up shares on the open market, because he would eventually hit that 80% theoretical maximum before he had to make a tender offer, assuming other insiders and active investors agreed to sell to him. Most of the time, investors looking to exert their influence don't need to acquire nearly as many shares. Note how he was already the largest shareholder with a 9% stake, and had been invited to the board."
With 125k to invest is it realistic to make 1k a day with being a conservative day trader?,"&gt;But how realistic is it? Especially someone who is fairly new to day trading.

It will take you a few years to achieve consistent results; trading is like any other skill in life. The key is surviving the learning curve and not falling for the get-rich-quick mentality. Most traders blow up their account while learning the cliché lessons along their journey. It doesn't have to be that way, however.

Run the numbers to see how many Risk Units (R's) you need to return to average $21k per month. Here is the math assuming you risk 1% of your account per trade.

|Capital|Risk Unit (%)|Risk Unit ($)|Monthly Goal ($)|Monthly Goal (R's)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$125,000|1.00%|$1,250|$21,000|16.8|

**17R a month is actually not that difficult to achieve—it's less than 1R per day.** Let's call it 20R before commissions, fees, expenses, etc.

How do you go about returning 20R per month? Do the math again. Here's an example comparing the win-rate and return-to-risk (R2R) combination that leads to 20R profit after **50 trades.**

|Accuracy|Reward-to-risk|Return in Rs|
|:-|:-|:-|
|40%|2.5:1|20|
|50%|2:1|25|
|60%|1.5:1|25|
|70%|1:1|20|
|80%|0.75:1|20|

The above table is just one way to achieve 20-25R. You might end up taking less trades or more per month. But there is some balance between accuracy and R2R which will allow you to hit your goal based on your trading style.

A Risk Unit is simply a function of your account size; the consistent trader continues doing the same thing up to a certain dollar-risk level which is feasible given constraints such as liquidity, volume, mental ceiling, etc.

If you can consistently make $10/day, all you need to do is scale up to achieve $100 per day, and eventually $1,000.

Cheers and best of luck."
Large GME Delta Sensitivity Spike Ever Happening Now!,"This might be gamma girl's most important post of the year, thank you.

For the smooths: big green line appeared around this time in Dec 2020, following RC's buy-in. We know what resulted in Jan 2021, and that spikes of this magnitude result in repeatable actions on any stock. When the stock is as illiquid as GME though, and the spike is the highest ever recorded, then holy shit. A fart can drive up the price far, far faster than downward shorting pressure can cope with - I believe right now it's roughly 200k volume to drive the price down $1, but it only takes about 20k to go up $1.

Big green line has appeared once again, but bigger. This month truly could be your very last shot at owning GME under $160, because everything is screaming that this is artificially underpriced. Whether it be shares or long dated options, if you've got cash to deploy the next few weeks look great."
As a veteran investor,"&gt; TA is good at interpreting the past, but if it was able to actually predict the future then somebody already wrote a script that can suck the value out of that play faster than any of our monkey brains can.

CDC announces new 60-day moratorium on evictions to 'allow additional time for rent relief to reach renters and to further increase vaccination rates',"So here is how it’s going to play out in my dystopian future. Small time landlords - which constitutes close to 50% of all landlords - can’t keep up with taxes/insurance/mortgage payments which all remain due and they start to be forced to sell. Big companies/hedge funds like Blackstone gobble up said properties at well over asking knowing they can take short term losses. However they jack up rents nonetheless to offset their losses. Properties values and rents go thru the roof. Soon the average Joe can’t afford to buy property and renters are essentially slaves to the hedge funds due to most of their monthly income going to rent. Then the Great Reset will be complete. We will all have nothing and be happy. You know, in my dystopian future

Edit: they can take the short term losses knowing that the govt is going to print money into oblivion and their property values will ultimately skyrocket"

"I just won 20k, is there any meaningful investment I can make with 5k?","A really common trap that people fall into when getting a windfall like this, is to spend it immediately. I would recommend holding onto it and just psychologically getting used to having that amount of money under your control. People tend to want to 'get rid' of money because they aren't used to having it. Take some time, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, to just acclimatise to having that cash. You'll have many nights to sleep on it, to think about the best uses, and to not do anything rash with it. Being poor your entire life and then coming into a significant amount of money like this is going to mess with your head a bit.   


Solve the urgent things that can be solved with your money, but for everything else, push it back for the next 3 months and work through the shock and panic that you'll be going through. 

I would also say, now that you've won at the Races you're going to be tempted to get that hit again. Do your very best to not give into that temptation. There's a common saying - no one leaves Vegas a winner: the losers lose their money, and the winners stick around chasing the thrill until they give back all their gains."

The Nordic countries seem to be among the most highly developed nations in the world. What are the economic reasons for this?,"What metrics do you mean specifically?

[Looking at GDP per capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true), Nordic countries aren't particular standouts on the list (Norway at 11, Denmark at 14, Sweden at 19, Finland at 22).

[Household disposable income](https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-disposable-income.htm) shows that they're doing well but also not particular standouts.

One thing these countries are notable for, and something that you're likely more curious about, [is how well they've been able to keep people out of poverty compared to other developed nations](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) where we're able to keep measurements.

There's a number of policies that have helped to accomplish this while still performing well in overall wealth metrics. One thing these countries have in common is [an interesting tax structure](https://taxfoundation.org/scandinavian-countries-taxes-2021/) compared to the US and other EU nations. Businesses pay lower taxes, and the very wealthy pay lower taxes, but the middle-upper class and moderately wealthy pay significantly more in income taxes and social security payments. Businesses also play a much larger role in subsidizing social security in Nordic countries (minus Denmark), and the sectoral bargaining agreements mean that firms have much less monopsony power to keep wages below equilibrium levels. The document I've linked here goes much further in depth regarding tax policy.

On the welfare side of the equation, Scandinavian countries have some of the most generous child benefits, parental leave, and unemployment protection programs in the developed world, as well as universal education and healthcare. [One thing to note is that Nordic countries also have fairly stringent work requirements](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/7084/in-work-benefits-and-the-nordic-model) for someone to have access to these programs

One thing to also note is that while these countries have traditionally done a good job of reducing poverty, [it is difficult for unskilled laborers to find work with the collective bargaining agreements that are in place and with how educated the rest of the work force is.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-unemployment-pandemic/new-swedes-left-out-as-economy-powers-through-pandemic-idUSKBN2B91MO) Unskilled work mostly goes to people who have an education and can be promoted to more specialized work when available."
Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto,"Update: Have done some of the initial research to see what all happened.

They also logged into one of my personal banking accounts and an old business account that basically just has enough for a last year of autopays, but didn't get anything accomplished.

I have six months to figure out how to make $3000 a month for the next three years,"Your best bet is to apply for grants and scholarships. There are so many random companies and programs that would love to give someone a couple thousand for college. Otherwise you need to generate just over 6 figures within the next 42 months. That's going to be very tough. Even a decent paying full time job won't cover this. You're going to need to either take out student loans or push back the start date and earn money beforehand. If you worked for a year and grinded. Maybe a full time job and pick up shifts somewhere else. You could probably save ~$50,000. That would allow you to have a lot more flexibility while in school. You'd still have to work to make the other $50,000 over those three years."
Kelly's criterion for gamblers,"Ok heres my strategy. Gather up all my cash, take out the biggest loan possible, HELOC on my house, borrow money from people I dont care about and then bet once.

"How Michael Burry figured out the 2007 crash, simple (own repost from Burryology)","Great post.

So banks no longer have a 10% reserve requirement?? How can this possibly be 'ok' or work?,"I'll only touch on your question about reserve requirements.

The basic story is that they've changed their monetary policy regime to an ample reserves one, where reserve requirements aren't a useful tool for controlling the money supply. This was in 2019, and for many years before that reserve requirements weren't a limiting factor for banks to make loans.

Edit: Also, the Fed isn't private in any meaningful sense ;)"
Reminder about US stocks in TFSA,"Honestly I think people tend to spend too much time worrying about stuff like this. A 15% tax on dividends means a US stock that pays a 4% dividend will instead give you a 3.40% dividend in your TFSA. Sure, if you want to optimize, aim to have US dividend stocks in your RRSP and US growth stocks in your TFSA, but on the list of decisions that affect people's wealth, this is pretty low down on the list."
Thetagang Does NOT Mean You Aren't Taking a Massive Risk,"The premium received from the put is the downside protection. As a believer in a company you're still etting paid to enter the position.

So all in all you can be upset that people are still taking on risk,  or you can accept they've calculated the risk and have still chosen to enter the position rather than buy 10x yolo weekly calls that expires worthless in 5 days.

Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity Pt 3 - WTF edition,"If y’all haven’t seen it the Andrew Ross Sorkin interview with Vlad is fucking hilarious.

The basics are that Vlad is claiming DTC collateral spiked pretty aggressively, and they made the choice to stop carrying these tickers because of that.  Basically in so many words he said the collateral requirements were too high and to protect RH they made the decision to block trades.  He literally says “protect the firm”, which is well and fine - but it means that the firm was at risk if they continued to offer these shares which has some implications.

ARS: “it sounds to me like you’re suggesting there was a liquidity problem at the firm

Vlad: (blank face) No, there was no liquidity problem 

Then Vlad goes on to repeat a bunch of marketing bullshit

https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-cnbcs-andrew-ross-sorkin-grills-robinhood-ceo-amid-massive-uproar-over-trading-freeze-in-gamestop-other-skyrocketing-stocks/amp/


The math don’t check out here- DTC requirements for sure fluctuate with volatility, and I’m sure they rose substantially with GME, but normal brokers just met the higher requirements and moved on with their day.  One of the following has to be true:

-	RH has liquidity concerns, and stopped trading because of that. This checks out with the news of them seeking an immediate 1B infusion from investors, and them drawing credit lines down yesterday. 
-	RH doesn’t have a liquidity issue, and just decided it didn’t want to meet capital requirements on those stocks because fuck you
-	RH doesn’t have a liquidity problem and chose to stop trading due to pressure from some external source. 

Vlad says it wasn’t the first or last, but that only leaves the middle which doesn’t make sense.  I know there’s a lot of conspiracy theories floating about but in my mind the easiest explanation is that RH has a liquidity problem, I mean we know they can’t get as much for PFOF as they were, and we know they can’t get much revenue from NIM, it’s not hard for me to believe they’re short on cash."

ELI5: what is the economic value of landlords?,"Generally they bear risks so renters don't have to. Usually a home owner is responsible for maintenance and repair of appliances and utilities, which requires some amount of budgeting for that. They also have to deal with the investment risks. If the local housing market goes badly they are on the hook, or if the HOA mismanages something they are on the hook not renters, etc. Same for structural insurance and the like. A renter has to insure her own stuff, but the owner insures the property from fires, floods, etc. or in some cases simply self insures with savings. 

It's a trade off, risk for price. To bear the risk responsibly you need savings, some people don't have large savings.

You could also make an argument that landlords make moving easier. There are lots of hurdles involved in home sale/purchases, but very little to be done when renting. In this way they can be seen as a way to help increase the 'efficiency' of the housing distribution -- making it easy for people to move closer to work etc.

As for your question about landlords vs innovative ideas, I'm quite sure they're not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of innovative property management ideas out there."
Anyone else disappointed in this sub?,"Completely agree. Someone posted recently asking if they found a deep value company because they were trading below book value.

I responded saying there was nothing that indicated value, they had a small market cap around 450m, had lost over $200m over the past 3 years and that number was growing with each year. The company was also in biotech which isn't the most stable industry, especially for such a small market cap. I argued with no proven track record, no dividend, and never turning a profit once and a small cap, the fact that it was trading below book value didn't make it a ""value"" stock, based on what I've read from Ben Grahams book.

His response was that we must have a different definitions because he thought they could eventually turn a profit one day. There was no analysis, nothing.

Why hasn't Economics become completely behavioural Economics/qualitative? Why does it continue to be mathematical and follow old classical Economics?,"I really despise these questions, not because they're ""wrong"" to ask, but because most often, they only inspire answers from non-economists that like to look down their noses at other fields. 

&gt; with so many sub-branches but an overall R-squared of 0.05! So, probably the mathematics used in Economics are either not updated (1870) and false

This guy is straight-up talking out his ass. Which is pretty sad, given that he appears to actually have a PhD with some concentration in economics. Statistical analysis is wayyy more nuanced than R^2 in this day and age. I generally do not give a fuck about R^2 . Also, economics did not really become ""mathematical"" in the way that it is now until sometime around the 1950s or 1960s. Quant analysis has been around for quite some time, but for many decades it was rather limited in scope, due to the lack of really good data, sophisticated methods, and computing power. Many of the old papers are quite... limited. If you read some of the then-popular theoretical papers on firm or consumer behavior from fifty years ago, they're very rudimentary compared to what we have today, because economic decisions are much more complicated than we thought they were.

I like to re-frame economics as really being a study of *incentives* and *optimization*. We are concerned with why people make choices in a given system (the incentive), and how they determine those choices (the optimization). A mathematical framework is convenient since this allows us to quantify how choices are made under a given set of conditions. For example, how we might substitute between spending on healthcare and other expenses when the cost of insurance is decreased or increased. A policy-maker would be very interested in quantifying exactly how much people tend to do this.

I'd also like to mention how economics research is actually done. For example, we may be interested in studying a policy change aimed towards giving assistance to specific neighborhoods in a city, as in [Busso, Gregory, and Kline (2013)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w16096). You may think that we're simply wondering ""okay, so let's conduct an RCT and see how people respond,"" and that is certainly one way to do that. [Banerjee et. al (2021)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/16594) could be an example. But the authors of many papers are also often concerned with picking apart the specific factors that impact these systems and outcomes. The model in the BGK paper is quite neat, and does rely on comparison of the communities that received funds to those that didn't, but it's not quite as granular as a conventional RCT that studies people on an individual level. These are both also ultimately behavioral studies, but the authors in both examples have different motivations for conducting their research and modeling in the way they do.

There are also plenty of things in the field of economics that are not about *specific* humans making choices and are more about the market itself. In antitrust policy, we are not only concerned with firms exercising monopoly power, we also need to be able to quantify potential negative effects of a merger to a judge. If we're looking at firm behavior, it's quite useful to do things like consider market demand and supply in a rather quantitative fashion, no? What about understanding the impact of monetary policy on the global economy? What about the [climate impact of tariffs in developing countries](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2w8uwabw7fuxcxq/Hsiao_palmoil.pdf?dl=0)? Psych-style methods would not do us much good if we are looking at how palm oil production impacts carbon emissions. 

The field of marketing might interest you. Many business schools accept both ""quant"" students, who are ultimately concerned with applying quantitative methods to data on sales of goods and services, and ""consumer behavior"" students, who look more at the psychology behind peoples' purchasing decisions. There is a lot of value to being able to listen to both sides if you are concerned with understanding how consumers choose products in the marketplace."
"Why should getting a health insurance ever be a profitable decision for the consumer, when the profitability of all insurance companies depends on paying less on claims than whatever they bill in premiums?","Consumers are assumed to be loss-averse, so their utility from losses and gains are assymetric, as such they're willing to pay a premium to avoid the possibility of a loss.

Let's say the expected value of your annual health-care costs are $1,000, but could be zero or could be $100,000. Depending on the shape of your individual utility function, it could be reasonable to pay $1,200 per year to avoid the possibility being bankrupted by the $100,000 bill.

The problem with health insurance though, is you have asymmetric information, leading to adverse selection i.e. if you're healthy and unlikely to claim, you're less likely to buy insurance than someone who knows they're sick. Insurance companies respond by pricing the insurance to cover the claims of sick people, which makes insurance even less attractive for healthy people, setting off a vicious cycle.

In order to function effectively, insurance markets need the probability of buying insurance to be independent from the probability of a claim. Hence, auto insurance works fairly efficiently, as it’s mandatory, as does property insurance, where there isn’t the same degree of asymmetric information."

"Does ""Why nations Fail"" contradict ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" ?","Apologies for the wall of text, but Acemoglu and Robinson discuss this issue (and Diamond's works specifically) in the second chapter of Why Nations Fail:

&gt;Another influential version of the geography hypothesis is
advanced by the ecologist and evolutionary biologist Jared
Diamond. He argues that the origins of intercontinental
inequality at the start of the modern period, five hundred
years ago, rested in different historical endowments of
plant and animal species, which subsequently influenced
agricultural productivity. In some places, such as the Fertile Crescent in the modern Middle East, there were a large
number of species that could be domesticated by humans. Elsewhere, such as the Americas, there were not. Having many species capable of being domesticated made it very
attractive for societies to make the transition from a huntergatherer to a farming lifestyle. As a consequence, farming
developed earlier in the Fertile Crescent than in the Americas. Population density grew, allowing specialization
of labor, trade, urbanization, and political development. Crucially, in places where farming dominated, technological
innovation took place much more rapidly than in other parts
of the world. Thus, according to Diamond, the differential
availability of animal and plant species created differential
intensities of farming, which led to different paths of
technological change and prosperity across different
continents.


&gt;Though Diamond’s thesis is a powerful approach to the
puzzle on which he focuses, it cannot be extended to
explain modern world inequality. For example, Diamond
argues that the Spanish were able to dominate the
civilizations of the Americas because of their longer history
of farming and consequent superior technology. But we
now need to explain why the Mexicans and Peruvians
inhabiting the former lands of the Aztecs and Incas are
poor. While having access to wheat, barley, and horses might have made the Spanish richer than the Incas, the gap
in incomes between the two was not very large. The
average income of a Spaniard was probably less than
double that of a citizen of the Inca Empire. Diamond’s
thesis implies that once the Incas had been exposed to all
the species and resulting technologies that they had not
been able to develop themselves, they ought quickly to
have attained the living standards of the Spanish. Yet
nothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a much larger gap in
incomes between Spain and Peru emerged. Today the
average Spaniard is more than six times richer than the
average Peruvian. This gap in incomes is closely
connected to the uneven dissemination of modern industrial
technologies, but this has little to do either with the potential
for animal and plant domestication or with intrinsic
agricultural productivity differences between Spain and
Peru. 

&gt;While Spain, albeit with a lag, adopted the technologies
of steam power, railroads, electricity, mechanization, and
factory production, Peru did not, or at best did so very
slowly and imperfectly. This technological gap persists
today and reproduces itself on a bigger scale as new
technologies, in particular those related to information
technology, fuel further growth in many developed and
some rapidly developing nations. Diamond’s thesis does
not tell us why these crucial technologies are not diffusing
and equalizing incomes across the world and does not
explain why the northern half of Nogales is so much richer
than its twin just to the south of the fence, even though both were part of the same civilization five hundred years ago.
The story of Nogales highlights another major problem in
adapting Diamond’s thesis: as we have already seen, whatever the drawbacks of the Inca and Aztec empires were in 1532, Peru and Mexico were undoubtedly more
prosperous than those parts of the Americas that went on
to become the United States and Canada. North America
became more prosperous precisely because it
enthusiastically adopted the technologies and advances of
the Industrial Revolution. The population became educated
and railways spread out across the Great Plains in stark
contrast to what happened in South America. This cannot
be explained by pointing to differential geographic
endowments of North and South America, which, if
anything, favored South America.


&gt;Inequality in the modern world largely results from the
uneven dissemination and adoption of technologies, and
Diamond’s thesis does include important arguments about
this. For instance, he argues, following the historian William
McNeill, that the east–west orientation of Eurasia enabled
crops, animals, and innovations to spread from the Fertile Crescent into Western Europe, while the north–south
orientation of the Americas accounts for why writing
systems, which were created in Mexico, did not spread to
the Andes or North America. Yet the orientation of
continents cannot provide an explanation for today’s world
inequality. Consider Africa. Though the Sahara Desert did
present a significant barrier to the movement of goods and
ideas from the north to sub-Saharan Africa, this was not
insurmountable. The Portuguese, and then other Europeans, sailed around the coast and eliminated
differences in knowledge at a time when gaps in incomes were very small compared with what they are today. Since
then, Africa has not caught up with Europe; on the contrary,
there is now a much larger income gap between most
African and European countries.

&gt;It should also be clear that Diamond’s argument, which is
about continental inequality, is not well equipped to explain
variation within continents—an essential part of modern world inequality. For example, while the orientation of the Eurasian landmass might explain how England managed to
benefit from the innovations of the Middle East without
having to reinvent them, it doesn’t explain why the Industrial
Revolution happened in England rather than, say, Moldova.
In addition, as Diamond himself points out, China and India
benefited greatly from very rich suites of animals and
plants, and from the orientation of Eurasia. But most of the
poor people of the world today are in those two countries.


&gt;In fact, the best way to see the scope of Diamond’s
thesis is in terms of his own explanatory variables. Map 4
shows data on the distribution of Sus scrofa, the ancestor
of the modern pig, and the aurochs, ancestor of the modern
cow. Both species were widely distributed throughout
Eurasia and even North Africa. Map 5 (this page) shows
the distribution of some of the wild ancestors of modern
domesticated crops, such as Oryza sativa, the ancestor of
Asian cultivated rice, and the ancestors of modern wheat
and barley. It demonstrates that the wild ancestor of rice was distributed widely across south and southeast Asia, while the ancestors of barley and wheat were distributed
along a long arc from the Levant, reaching through Iran and
into Afghanistan and the cluster of “stans” (Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, and Krgyzistan). These ancestral species are
present in much of Eurasia. But their wide distribution
suggests that inequality within Eurasia cannot be explained
by a theory based on the incidence of the species.


&gt;The geography hypothesis is not only unhelpful for
explaining the origins of prosperity throughout history, and mostly incorrect in its emphasis, but also unable to account
for the lay of the land we started this chapter with. One might argue that any persistent pattern, such as the
hierarchy of incomes within the Americas or the sharp and
long-ranging differences between Europe and the Middle East, can be explained by unchanging geography. But this
is not so. We have already seen that the patterns within the Americas are highly unlikely to have been driven by
geographical factors. Before 1492 it was the civilizations in
the central valley of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes that had superior technology and living standards to North America or places such as Argentina and Chile. While the geography stayed the same, the institutions
imposed by European colonists created a “reversal of
fortune.” Geography is also unlikely to explain the poverty of
the Middle East for similar reasons. After all, the Middle East led the world in the Neolithic Revolution, and the first
towns developed in modern Iraq. Iron was first smelted in
Turkey, and as late as the Middle Ages the Middle East was technologically dynamic. It was not the geography of
the Middle East that made the Neolithic Revolution flourish
in that part of the world, as we will see in chapter 5, and it was, again, not geography that made the Middle East poor.
Instead, it was the expansion and consolidation of the Ottoman Empire, and it is the institutional legacy of this
empire that keeps the Middle East poor today.


&gt;Finally, geographic factors are unhelpful for explaining
not only the differences we see across various parts of the world today but also why many nations such as Japan or China stagnate for long periods and then start a rapid
growth process. We need another, better theory."

\- They go to a bank and ask for $100 million dollars in exchange for 1 billion shares (i.e sacrificing shareholder control of the company).

\- The bank (called a ""Market maker"") sells those shares to the public on IPO day for $10  a share.

\- Joe public says ""I love dicks! Lem'me buy 20,000 shares at said said price of $10!""

\- Gary shows up and goes ""Well I hate dicks, and I don't believe in this company, so I'll buy your shares for $5/share""

\- ""Fuck you Gary, I ain't selling you shit!""

\- ""Fine Joe, then will you sell me your shares for $12?""

\- ""Yes"". Sale-transaction occurs.

Learnings from dealing in real estate,"After doing a few real estate transactions, the things I have noticed are:

1)There is way too much overhead in the form of registration fees, stamp duty, lawyer fees, bribes etc. In any deal, 10% of the price of the property be it land or house goes in covering these overheads. 2-5% brokerage fees are extra. So you could end up paying up to 15% extra in total. If this is an investment for you, your land price must increase by 15% before you breakeven.

Earlier circles rates were very low, so people didn't care as much about these fees but now in many places, circle rates are actually more than the market rates. This can burn a massive hole in your pocket because all fees are a percentage of this.

2) Following up on the previous point....buying below circle rate is problematic even if it's legitimitate. I had to cough up a huge amount of money in advance tax this year because of section 56(2)(X) as I bought a parcel of land 20% below circle rate last year. This is just adding salt to the wound because I already paid all the fees and duties based on circle rate.

3) Real estate brokers will vehemently request you to pay money in cash. Don't pay the circle rate amount in cash no matter what. It's illegal to purchase any immovable property with more than 20k in cash. Sub-registrar should ideally refuse to register the property but they don't check anything and you will get notice from IT dept later. The sale deed itself may be nullified and invalidated in such cases.

4) Check if there is any lien on the land. It's possible the owner may have taken a loan on this. Do not buy this unless and until the land owner clears the loan and gets an NOC for it. The land owner may request you to foot the money required to clear the loan outstanding. If you agree to do this, write down everything in a sale agreement along with the cheque number and get the sale agreement registered with the sub-registrar. Broker may insist on a notarized sale agreement to fool you but you must register it to get legal protection. Since the legal system in India is slow as molasses and agreements can often not be enforced, it's best if you avoid giving any money altogether before registration is done.

5) Once you have paid the token money, ask the seller to produce the original title deed. He should have no objection to it. Do not be satisfied with a Xerox copy. If he has taken a loan on the land from the informal sector such as a local moneylender, there won't be any encumbrance on the land that will show up on official records but he won't be able to produce the original deed.

6) Always verify the plot number of the plot you are being sold. Get the plot map from the tehsil or municipality and either verify it yourself if you know how to read maps or pay some money to the tehsildar or patwari or some other competent authority and take him to the site to get it verified in person. If you are shown one land by broker and then another land is registered in your name, you are done for and there is very little recourse later on.

7) Always check for clear title of the land. Inherited land often has multiple stakeholders. Each stakeholder can individually sell off their share in the land without permission of the other stakeholders. Often the seller will show the best portion of the land to you to make the sale attractive and then the other stakeholders will raise a dispute after sale. Now you are screwed. You can't just take that juicy corner plot with road access and build your house as per your fancy and leave the crappy plots behind for others.

It should be kept in mind that you will become a joint tenant with all the stakeholders after sale and you will NOT have the right to claim any part of that land as exclusively your own. To mitigate this, there should be a written deed on stamp paper that mentions which portion of the land belongs to which stakeholder and it should be signed by all. Without this document, every stakeholder has equal rights to use all parts of the land equally. In addition, on the day of registration, all stakeholders must be present in the sub-registrar's office so that they don't raise a hue and cry after all is said and done.

8) Get your property mutated as soon as registration is done. Don't dilly dally. Real estate sector in India is a mess as is the record keeping. Sale deeds can easily be falsified and it's not uncommon to find the same land sold to multiple people. Sub-registrar checks nothing before registering a deed. Later you find that multiple people are laying claim to the same piece of land. Indian judiciary will take 30 years to sort out that mess. Unless the property records show your name, the deed is of little value. So get your name mutated into the land records as fast as possible. Pay a little here if you have to in order to fast track it.

9) Always hire a lawyer to do some basic due diligence. It will cost you not more than 5k and he will not only verify the title but also prepare the deed and help with the registration formalities. However, since land records are also available online in most places, you should do your own due diligence too. Whatever you see online is what the lawyer will see too. If the property is not in the seller's name, it should immediately raise a red flag. If it's in his ancestor's name, he should provide you with the succession certificate to proof that he has claim over the property.

10) It's very tough to do a proper title verification when it comes to inherited land. So sit with the seller and try to draw the entire family tree in a visual manner on a plain piece of paper. The family tree should start with the original owner and then branch on to the inheritors. Verify this information with the other inheritors who are still alive (stakeholders). This is to make sure the seller didn't miss out on a brother or sister who may have a claim on that land. Now sit with the lawyer and figure out what percentage share of the land the seller actually has as per the family tree and whether it matches with the seller's claim. If seller claims that some stakeholders have sold their stake to him, ask him to produce the sale deeds and mutation certificates for the same. This is a long and arduous process. Take your time.

11) Before registering and paying for any land, go to the tehsil office and request the ameen (land surveyor) to come to the site and measure the land in his official capacity. Some places may require you to fill up a form for this and submit the requisite fee. It's important you get this done. This is to make sure you are getting the exact measurements and land area seller promised you. Then buy some angles and barbed wires and ring fence the entire plot. Wait for a couple of weeks while you carry out the legal due diligence. If nobody shows up and creates a ruckus, then it's probably all good and you can proceed.

12) Before finalizing a deal, be sure to ask the broker how much he is going to charge. 1-2% is the norm in most places but for small deals, the rate can go up to 4-6%. I got a rude shock when my broker asked for 5% after the registration was done for one of my deals. In another deal, broker didn't take any money, probably because he got his cut from the seller.

13) Last but not the least, check if all land taxes have been paid for and all dues are cleared. Land tax is usually very little in most places, so that's not something you need to be worried about. But still why fork out an extra 10k or 20k later on because the previous owner didn't pay his dues?

Buying land anywhere in India, especially in rural area is tough because the record keeping is so poor. Do as much due diligence as possible and leave the rest to fate."
Is this true or bull? The nature of money.,"It is true that banking is fractional reserve. However, there are many problems with this account of it:

&gt; For example, when a new mortgage is originated, that money does not come out of a bank vault. Instead, the money is created as a result of the loan. The bank supplies it to the borrower as a bank credit, with the borrower promising to repay the principal plus interest at a future date. This new debt is registered with a federal reserve or a central bank to the commercial bank’s account, allowing it to now loan out more money based on a multiple of that new loan—usually at a ratio of ten or more to one. So the more money the bank lends, the more it has available to lend.”

This is more definitely *not* how it works. Let's say that you take out a mortgage. Now, the bank simply enters a number in your account. That's because your account is simply a piece of book-keeping between yourself and them. Let's say that they enter in $90K.

Now, there is no registering of this *debt* with the federal reserve. That's not how it works. Deposits are registered with the federal reserve, not debts. Nor does this enable the bank to loan out more based on a multiple of your loan. That's wrong, it's a confusion of how the money multiplier works.

You then spend your $90K. That creates a bank transfer. That means that your bank must transfer $90K of funds to another bank. That is effectively the same as a transfer of cash. Bank reserves are akin to coins and notes. They're created by the Central Bank. They can be exchanged for coins and notes. So, you bank needs to have $90K of reserves when you make that transfer. That usually means in practice that it must have the reserves when it grants you the mortgage. Though it may be able to hold off until the last minute to obtain them. (This is why some banks require you to spend your mortgage at a particular time they set).

Now, ""money multiplication"" certainly happens, but not in the way this story portrays it. It happens *amongst many banks* not *inside one bank*. The key to this is that after your bank have lent to you then the reserves have gone back into circulation. The bank that you have paid can then use the reserve to make another loan. As a result another bank deposit is created at another bank. So, the same reserves make many loans.

In the past this multiplication process was limited by required reserves. This was a regulation. Each bank must keep a little back of each deposit they receive and only lend out a fraction. That means that the amount of money created overall would peter-out. So, it starts with someone putting in $100K. The old 10% reserve requirement would mean that the bank would have to sit on $10K of those reserves. They would then use $90K to grant a mortgage to you. That creates a transfer to another bank. That second bank then must put $9K aside and can loan $89K. It does that at those reserves come into the hands of another bank who do the same again. Required reserves were invented to limit the process of money creation. Recently, the US abolished required reserves and replaced them with different regulations. Other countries did that same a few years ago.

The money multiplier does *not* happen all at once. If I put $100K into a bank then that does not mean that the bank can lend out $1M. Oh no, it can loan out $100K at the most.

Notice there is nothing particularly special about this. Think about people making loans to each other in a cafe or bar. One $50 bill can make several loans as it passes from hand to hand. But that cannot create money simply because those small time interpersonal debts can't be used to trade with. I can't, say, pay for my meal in a restaurant by handing over an IOU from Phil who I lent $50 to in a bar the previous night. But I can pay for my meal in a restaurant by handing over an electronic IOU from my bank, like a debit card. That's because my bank is widely trusted and Phil isn't.

There are several other problems with this account of the process. I can describe them if you're interested."
How complex is your algo?,"I run an quant firm in Toronto and have been deploying successful trading strategies for about 15 years. Every single one of my strategies can be fully explained in simple English in about 2-3 minutes, every single one of them. In fact as a matter of principle if a strategy can't be explained in simple English then I am distrustful of it and simply refuse to give it much further consideration.

There is nothing complicated about them and the math that we use is there strictly as a tool to validate and optimize what are otherwise a simple set of intuitive and creative assumptions. Now that math can and does become very sophisticated over time, but the premise of the strategy is never mathematical, the math is only introduced afterwards to give the idea a rigorous formulation. This formulation is absolutely critical in order to properly validate a trading strategy. In other words, once you have an idea, you need to come up with a system to try to disprove it and the only way to disprove an idea is to give it a firm mathematical foundation and test against that.

I kid you not when I say if I told you our strategies you'd probably just look at us and think ""No way... really? It's that simple?"" Furthermore all of our strategies are arbitrage, we never speculate on the future direction of a stock and only execute a trade when we identify an arbitrage opportunity.

The overwhelming majority of our challenge comes not from the ideas but in the execution of those strategies; having high quality well written software (that we develop entirely in-house), a robust environment that allows us to quickly identify new opportunities, iterate on them, test them and get quick feedback.

What makes a firm or even an individual trader successful isn't the sophistication of a handful of ideas, but rather an environment and culture that can quickly identify an opportunity, subject it to scrutiny, and transform that idea into a simple and straight forward algorithm."

Hopefully you have decent equity in your homes, if not, you may need to consider bankruptcy if he can't quickly find a new job.

Edit 2: I don't want to be mean, but you don't even seem to know how to really run a real estate business. You should be registered as a business and have business loans to finance remodeling. Using high interest credit cards that you don't plan to pay off for several years is insane. You also don't seem to know how to adequately price and market your rentals given the amount of vacancies you seem to have, despite the tightest housing market in recent history. I'd recommend just selling all 5 and getting out, and investing in passive index funds...there's no way your current strategy is making you more money than that given all the sub-optimal strategies you've been doing."
anyone else tired of meme stock talk?,"If your point on Twitter was “AMC price is out of line with traditional measures of fundamentals. Therefore you should sell”, then I’m not surprised you got flack because that’s not addressing their main thesis. Hodlers of AMC (and GME) aren’t betting on current measures of traditional fundamentals (“last 12 month PE ratio”, “book value”, etc.) They’re betting on value of a different kind (and it’s not just FOMO buying, though that doesn’t hurt). It’s like if you went long on an undervalued company for the long term and someone told you to sell because the Fibonacci resistance levels on the hourly chart are against you. They might not be wrong per say (assuming Fibonacci resistance levels are valid), but it’s simply not relevant to your strategy. If instead you provided concrete evidence that all shorts had covered, then you would have had a much better reaction because that’s useful to the main thesis (granted, it probably still would be a controversial post, and you almost certainly can’t produce such evidence because the regulatory systems in place have loopholes to let financial institutions fake short interest numbers).

To be frank, I’m pretty surprised that many value investors (probably including the great Buffet himself) view AMC/GME with such disdain. Back in the day, Buffet himself found “financial stupidities” in the market where a company was trading for less than just the assets the company owned. He would invest in these stocks even though people thought he was crazy for investing in a “failing company”. I won’t speak for AMC in particular (I haven’t done as much research on AMC), but GME is very much in this vein: the market heavily over-shorted the company, the company is making a turnaround, and now the price needs to adjust back upwards.

At the end of the day, you can play your strategy while others play theirs. Just don’t expect them to agree with you when you tell them their strategy is wrong without addressing their actual thesis ;)"

The Economy’s Fundamental Problem Has Changed,"I'm not disputing the writer's assertion, but it doesn't match up with my personal experience, and where there have been some shortages the reason is varied.

For example, the shortage of infant formula had a lot to do with a major supplier that was shut down due to safety concern occurring at the same time as we experienced COVID supply chain issues.

The shortage of coins is really a shortage of coins circulating, not a shortage of actual coins. This was due to fewer people spending cash.

The shortage of child care workers is the same issue we are seeing with other high- stress / low-pay jobs. No one wants these jobs right now, especially if the work involves dealing with the public.

I hadn't heard of the vet shortage, but looked it up and it's pretty much the same - dissatisfaction with salary and working conditions, especially the expectations and attitudes of clients.

People are increasingly rude and hostile towards others, sometimes physically. Veterinarians, child care workers, health care workers, teachers, fast food workers, airline attendants, retail associates, you name it. Everyone is fed up with the public."

This may sound reductive but at the end of the day, you can develop as complex of a model as you want and extrapolate on its properties with economic theory for as many pages as you want, but i think it’s good practice that if you’re doing policy analysis, you should try to empirically validate your model by comparing its output to a dataset of some kind.

Illinois Governor calls out Ken Griffin for lying during Bloomberg interview and also for lying to Congress!,"The thing that pisses in my trumpet about Ken Griffin and any other stock market billionaires is that they haven't actually produced anything. Ken and Citadel haven't made a damn thing, all they've done is successfully siphoned off money from other people, who are actually doing and making things for the benefit of society.

The only thing he can argue that he has 'produced' is liquidity. But liquidity comes at the dilution of value. When a share can be easily traded due to liquidity, it loses it's scarcity, and thus it's inherent value. And liquidity doesn't put food on the table, or invent new technology, or solve life's problems.

Every penny he has, has effectively been legally embezzled from society. He produces nothing, but he takes everything with exponential severity.

Violence on the street? That comes from poverty. Violence increasing? That's because poverty increasing. Where is the money you ask? Ken and his cronies are taking it for themselves, then complaining about the effects it's having on society.

The median wage for economists is above what the median person with a masters degree earns and of course way above the general median wage.

Career outlooks and unemployment numbers look really good as well.

This will look roughly the same for most other countries as well. Economists usually earn good money and don't have any trouble finding jobs.

It's also a very versatile degree, since a lot of economics is basically learning how to handle and interpret data, and that can be applied to a wide range of fields.

It's a good degree both career and content wise, everybody who thinks otherwise is simply uninformed."

So you’ve literally gifted free education, free grad school, and free retirement.

"ETH Killer, Solana, Attempts Suicide","I am prepared for the downvotes, but let's speak TRUTH to what happened.

Solana was NOT SHUTDOWN on a WHIM. It was overloaded! Very similar to a DoS attack. What is a DoS attack? It is when a server is bombarded by requests so that it cannot function. This happens because servers are limited by their hardware. (think of what happens when you try to run a computer game on max graphics on a crappy computer, it becomes so laggy and your computer might even crash.)

The reasons why SOLANA stopped working is because of some DeFi project that was spamming transactions on the main chain. Solana has a max TPS of 46,000. But this DeFi project triggered a bug that was creating transactions past that limit. All the validators failed because of their inability to process the sheer amount of transactions that was occurring because of this bug.

Also think about this logically, why would SOLANA shut down their own network on a whim? That's a nightmare. Also how would that even work? The blockchain has open source code, if this was true, please point to the code that allows this functionality.

I'm not saying this was a NOT a bad event. But SOLANA is in Beta. The dev team of SOLANA has owned up to the bug in their code. It is what it is. Shit goes wrong. People have every reason to sell their SOL because of this issue, it looks bad. It is bad. But they found the bug and they are fixing it."
Would the economy be better off if we had not addressed covid-19 and let the virus run rampant?,"This is, unfortunately, very much so going to be speculation. Of course, the Imperial College study is already a long time ago in the quickly moving news cycle, and whilst other studies also estimate the [effects of a lockdown](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/09/872441984/modelers-suggest-pandemic-lockdowns-saved-millions-from-dying-of-covid-19), it is difficult to estimate how many lives it would've cost. The important notion here is that mortality rates aren't linear. The study above estimates the amount of cases in april to be 14 times as high if no measures were taken. Seeing that many hospitals and ICU are already overloaded, mortality rates would've spiked. Plus, many choices would've needed to be made on who gets to be treated, and those choices as well affect everything else.



As such, I don't think I'm qualified to give you actual numbers. But I do think you underestimate the long-term effect of a shock to population numbers. The reasoning now is that, whilst people may not be visiting your restaurant now, at least there will be people left to visit your restaurant after the pandemic. You have to realize that the people who have ''no more earning potential'' do have spending potential, and inflate the value of assets. Much of the economy, for example, is tied to the housing market. If many younger citizens inheret land and houses relatively suddenly in areas in which they do not wish to live, they will sell these assets causing a housing crash, for example. In that case, those receiving inheretance will in fact not receive much, whilst those who passed away kept the economy partially running with their expenses. 


The thing is, there are many ways in which such a scenario could play out. For example, people may even change their behavior to an extent by which it simulates a lockdown. If many people around you are starting to pass, you will be less likely to visit a restaurant and demand working from home if possible. The thing is that *if* you are going to go through a lockdown, you may as well start early - this gives healthcare the chance to find a cure and/or improve treatment (ICU care has for example dropped from on average a few weeks to a few days).


Edit: A wise thing to do would be to look at counterfactuals. [Sweden](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53664354) for example, has had much less strict regulations. They do see a smaller shrinkage than the EU average, but still, -8.6% compared to -11.9% is not that big of an improvement, and, if recovery is larger in the countries hit worse, the long-term effects may be minimal. Also very important when doing a comparison is to think of the contextual differences; many expected, for example, Africa to be hit very badly by COVID - but this is not the case. This makes complete sense as many African populations have a) more experience with the regulations (due to e.g. Ebola) b) generally live in much more secluded and rural communities (a big reason why contagious diseases have historically plagued Africa less) and c) have an, on average, much younger population. Comparing apples to apples is really difficult here."

Why do many people still talk about stock trading when index funds exist?,"There is a small, but nonzero chance of your stocks doing better than index funds. If you do your research into a firm and have an understanding of the industry it's operating in, you may identify smaller firms that will grow significantly more than indices. Investing in a stock index is basically the ultimate in diversifying in the stock market: Your chances of making huge money go down, but your chances of losing money also goes down.

Then the videos themselves can be useful tools to understanding how the stock market works and getting some grasp of economics. So even those who do not participate might watch and come out better. 

On the flipside, the romanticization of the first paragraph's concept, where you could make more money by betting on individual firms rather than on indices brings in viewers as well. The potential rewards of having first put money into Facebook and come out 5 years later with millions of dollars is attractive, if incredibly unlikely. Despite the unlikelihood of this, it is still powerfully attractive to some people, enough to keep a few Youtubers making guides on how to invest, despite them possibly giving advice that would cost their viewers money in the long run.

Further, some people find it fun to manage their own stocks. In this case, making money may not be the primary goal, but instead finding successful businesses and rooting for them, as a hobby is. Like most hobbies, this may cost money but it can be fun."

Betty is the worst market timer in history. From 1980-2020, she invested her money at all of the market peaks.

Joe is the best market timer in history, he always waited and invested his money at market lows.

Carol doesn’t pay attention to that noise, she invested her money consistently and regularly. Adding $1000 each month.

Betty had just under $1 million dollars at retirement.

Joe had $1.4 million.

Carol had $1.7 million.

"Apparently McDonalds pays 2-3x in Denmark what they do in the US, but prices are only slightly higher. How does the math work for it to still be worth running a franchise?","I was curious about this question so looked into it. First, based on research done by [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/sep/03/other-98/can-you-make-45000year-mcdonalds-denmark/), it looks like the average wage is about 2x in Denmark compared to the US, so let's put aside 3x.

Note that relative prices (and wages) are tricky to determine, because of fluctuating exchange rates. Actually today a Big Mac in Denmark costs [less](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274326/big-mac-index-global-prices-for-a-big-mac/) than a Big Mac in the US. About 7 years ago, though, the Euro was up to 20% higher and so was the cost of McDonald's food in Denmark. If we take a rough estimate of around 5% higher price under a ""normal"" exchange rate, we still have a lot of explaining to do to show how Denmark does it profitably.

For a fast food restaurant, labor costs are much less than half of total expenses. [This](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/common-food-labor-cost-percentages-14700.html) industry publication says it is around 25-30% of total expenses (so does [this](https://www.7shifts.com/blog/restaurant-costs/) one). Food cost is also around 30%. Other costs include real estate, equipment, management, marketing and utilities. The rest is profit (to oversimplify).

So, if labor cost goes up by 100% and revenue goes up by 5%, that creates a 20-25% pressure on the profit margin that has to be addressed. Apparently average margin for a franchise is 5-6% in the US.

I think part of the problem here is the assumption that labor costs actually go up 100% in Denmark. With a middle-class wage, there is definitely a lot less turnover in Denmark and that reduces cost. Turnover is a huge problem in fast food restaurants, where [130% turnover](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/fast-food-restaurants-in-america-are-losing-100percent-of-workers-every-year.html) in a year is common. Turnover creates costs in hiring, training, and lost productivity. Just using the first web [source](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee) I found on this, the average cost per instance of turnover is around $3,000, so at a rate of 130% that's around $4,000 per employee per year, which would raise the cost from around $20,000 annual labor cost for staff to $24,000. That doesn't count lost productivity, so Denmark restaurants can also probably make do with fewer employees on a shift, on average, for a given volume of orders.

Now I'm spitballing, but if front line management is also paid better in Denmark and has a higher retention rate, then it too is likely to be more competent and efficient. This can translate into all sorts of other relevant changes, like lower presenteeism and less wasted food. While I haven't dug deep enough to put numbers to it, perhaps half of the total cost difference can be attributed to a higher quality, lower turnover workforce.

The only other thing that occurs to me is that McDonald's in Europe has a much higher volume per location than in the US (see annual [report](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/investors-relations/financial-information/annual-reports.html) for US vs International data, which consists mostly of Europe). The revenue per restaurant is roughly double, so that also suggests greater efficiencies are possible in Europe, which probably shaves several more percentage points off the cost of operations."
My Broker (Questrade) called the police on me after I refused to take down posts criticizing them,"OP, take this to the media. Go right to CBC and all other media outlets.

"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","I'll address one point:

&gt;Medium/long-term, we would realise either a) we don't need this/that industry or b) this industry needs to be more efficient. It would provide a huge opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship as people try to fill the vacuum left by collapsed companies.

The problem is that whole industries are collapsing, not because they are badly run, but because they're faced with an extremely serious natural disaster disaster, an act of god. These companies would be essential to the coming recovery. Case in points is the airline industry. All airlines are going to have practically zero flights for the next few months, but they are still going to incur significant costs. Any business operating in such a situation will collapse- it isn't about efficiency. A random shock has fallen from the sky. It's like allowing all local businesses and companies to collapse after hurricane Katrina.

When the virus eases up and we're trying to rebuild the economy, if the airlines are all out of business, it will take time- for new entrants to set up businesses etc- that will take months, even years. Do you think the American economy can function without airlines for a few months, and recover quickly? Probably not.

The coronavirus isn't some terrible moral failing of capitalism, it's a very very very serious natural disaster that affects just about everyone- if you let the businesses collapse, your recovery is going to be very slow."
Financial Reality Check,"Completely agree. I think the nature of this forum lends itself to people with either more savings than they know what do with (in a literal sense - not trying to put anyone down!) or those who are really struggling.

"How is the USA's Unemployment Rate only 13.3% and not 24%, when there are 40M unemployed people out of a workforce of 164M people?","First of all, unemployment benefits only count one side--people who have lost jobs. They don't count people who got jobs over that period of time. Second, the workforce no longer consists of 164M people. As you can see in the link you posted, it did consist of \~164.5 million people in February, but as of May (the most recent figure), it includes about \~158.2M people. This suggests that as some people lost their jobs, they simply chose not to look for work.

The most recent [Employment Situation report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) includes some more details:

&gt; Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 2.5 million in May, and the unemployment rate  declined to 13.3 percent  
&gt;  
&gt; The unemployment rate declined by 1.4 percentage points to 13.3 percent in May, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million  
&gt;  
&gt; The labor force participation rate increased by 0.6 percentage point in May to 60.8 percent, following a decrease of 2.5 percentage points in April 

So TL;DR, there isn't 40 million people unemployed, there is 21 million. And there isn't 164 million people in the labor force, there is 158.22 million. 21/158.227 = 13.3% unemployment"

What did Buffett mean?,"Not completely sure without the context, but here’s what I think he meant. Let’s say your company has a net worth of $1 billion. If you retain earnings equal to 10% of net worth every year, by year 10, your company’s net worth compounds to $1*(1.1)^10= $2.594 billion. Of that amount, $1 billion is attributable to allocation decisions made prior to those 10 years (since that’s what the company was worth at the beginning). Then, $2.594-$1=$1.594 billion dollars of worth was created by the allocation decision made by the CEO in the last 10 years. It happens that $1.594/$2.594=61.45%."

What exactly happens when taxes are “too high”?,"**TL;DR Earning more money is a significant incentive for working harder, longer and producing more outputs. Increasing income taxes reduces this incentive, and, all else being equal, we would expect people to work less hard, for less time and produce less. Because 'the economy' is just the aggregate of what people produce, less production means a smaller, slower-growing (or even contracting), economy.**  


First, a caveat: the economics of tax policy is tricky! Why? Because understanding a given proposal often involves understanding how that policy might operate at the individual level ('how would introducing this tax affect my decision making?') and then aggregating this up to the whole-of-economy level. Even in isolation this is difficult, but introduce the complications of the actual real-world tax system, with different rates, deductions, types of income and types of earner, and it gets very complex indeed.

Luckily the question you've asked is fairly straightforward, but i'm going to make some assumptions so I can give you a clearer answer (assumptions in brackets): how does increasing the (personal income) tax rate affect economic growth (all else being equal)?

**Note**: the effect of higher rates of \*other\* taxes, like the corporate tax rate or consumption taxes, is different again!

**Ok with that said, Incentives!**

A lot of tax policy is about trying to understand how different types and rates of taxes affect people's incentives to save, work and spend. Let's start with a very simplified case study. 

Economists tend to assume (there are exceptions) that we can expect people to be rational actors who attempt to maximise their utility subject to a set of constraints. People derive utility from having money (because it allows them to buy things), and they also derive utility from not working (because it allows them to have leisure time). We also assume that people make their decisions \*at the margin\*. For example, you might be willing to work 4 hours in a row for $20 an hour, but after 4 hours you're tired and cranky and ready for a break, so $20 is not enough to work the 5th hour. If the pay got upped to $40 an hour, however, you would be willing to work through your tiredness for hour number 5. 

To pre-emptively address a common critique of economics by non-economists: yes, not everyone is rational or has the same incentives! But, on average across a whole economy, assumptions about people being rational actors *tends* to be true enough that it's predictive.

**A simple economy**

Using this trade off between work and leisure, and our marginal willingness to work, we imagine people making decisions about how much to work. For simplicity, let's imagine I own my own pie business. I make pies at a rate of 1 pie per hour, and I sell those pies (let's imagine there is infinite demand for my pies so they always sell) for $20 per pie. I live at home, and all my food and housing is paid for by my parents, so I just work to have money to spend on things I like, like travelling and model trains.

I might decide that 30 hours a week is the perfect balance between earnings and leisure time, and my contribution to the economy is 30 pies, in real terms, for which i'm payed $600. We could assume from this that, after 30 hours a week, the wage i would demand to work the 31st hour is more than $20!

**Tax policy (gone wrong!)**

Now let's imagine we increase income taxes. We want to be progressive, so we introduce a tax of 50% \*only\* on people earning more than $400 a week. This means that, after my first 20 pies, half of my marginal income is now paid in tax. 

Now, instead of being paid $20 for each extra hour that I work, after my first 20 hours i'm paid $10! I'm still pretty fresh after 20 hours of work a week, and I'd like a bit more than $400 in total, but i'm not going to work the full 30 hours - maybe I decide to work 25 hours. After 25 hours, i'm willing to keep working for $20 an hour, but $10 just seems too low.

What happens to my contribution to the economy? Well I used to make 30 pies a week and now I make 25. If everyone in the economy is like me, on average, the result would be a roughly 15% decline in Gross Domestic Product! 

**Ok, but like, there is more to the economy than pie?**

Our preceding example is very simple, but it demonstrates a basic mechanism behind the impact of higher income tax - by reducing the marginal returns to work, higher tax rates incentivise people to work less and hang out more. The higher the tax, the less the effective return for working an additional hour is, and the more likely people are to work less. 

You can see that it rests on a few assumptions. In addition to the assumptions we laid out at the start, in my case study I can choose how much to work, don't need a certain amount of money to survive and face no uncertainty - I get paid hourly. 

Much of the economy today is not like that - some people work jobs that are paid annual wages, others would work \*more\* if their wages went down in order to meet their minimum living requirements, and still others have salaries with large variable components like bonuses or performance targets. 

Some of these things reduce the effect of income taxes on work incentives, or even reverse them. But, on average: high income taxes mean lower incomes, lower incomes mean people face weaker incentives to work and produce. Even if the taxed income is redistributed by the government, the total pie ( ;) )  is still smaller than it would have been.

Does this mean we should have no taxes? Not at all - apart from anything else, the government uses tax revenue to provide many goods and services that are core to the modern economy, like infrastructure and education. Some trade-off of total GDP for equity is also totally reasonable. But we should understand what the trade-offs are, and how to reduce them. Some types of taxes are more distortionary than others, so we should decide on the level of redistribution that we want, and use the combination of taxes and spending to get there as efficiently as possible."
going out with friends to celebrate someone's birthday for dinner almost financially broke me this budgeting period,"Send a specific CashApp/Venmo request for the amount each “friend” owes you. 

It’s easier to ignore a receipt than a request to be repaid, and you may get most of it back, but not the friendship or trust they destroyed."

\&gt; How can you genuinely believe it is morally justified to charge people for the one place that provides them safety in a time like this?

Lets rephrase this slightly:

""How can you genuinely believe it is morally justified to charge people for the \*food and nutrients\* which provides them safety in a time like this?""

This feels like a silly question now, right? The grocery store shouldn't be responsible for giving everything away just because someone doesn't have money.

&amp;#x200B;

There seems to be a misconception that just because you have a property that you rent out, that you take 0 loses if you don't collect rent. If that was the case, I see your point. The person comes off as greedy, by taking everything from their poor tenant just so that they can grow their pile of cash. This is not the case. In the event that rent isn't collected, you still have to pay (among other costs, and assuming you fully own the property outright): property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, management, etc. When considering this, it really sounds like you're saying ""Do you feel guilty by not paying out of your own pocket for a stranger to have a place to stay? Don't you think you should be donating more money?""

&amp;#x200B;

Should there be stronger social safety nets to help people who fall on tough times, just like we have food banks for necessary food and nutrients? Yes, probably, but this responsibility should not fall solely on people who own a couple properties."

Why does the Ofgem price cap ‘have’ to go up?,"You seem to be confusing energy suppliers with energy producers. 

Energy suppliers like Octopus, Bulb and Scottish Power buy energy at the wholesale price and we pay for energy from these suppliers - in most cases they don’t produce the energy themselves.

Why isn’t everyone investing in Real Estate?,"Not trying to be mean, but did you become sentient after 2007/08?

Edit:
Someone else mentioned elsewhere in the thread, but it bears repeating.

Simple but helpful advice for beginners,"I’d also add that you should also identify your version of a blue chip (in my case it’s ETH).  The thing you’ve researched and know is sound, and would bet your entire trading stack on if someone put a gun to your head.

I have thought for cryptodecades (so like 1 year) that ETH was, and continues to be, undervalued relative to the market.  Hence it’s my personal blue chip.

Given that the first thing people want to do when panicking is to “sell back to fiat”, you’ll note that lots of your funds are usually only convertible to another crypto on most exchanges.  So regardless of what you want to do, you basically cannot make it home to fiat quickly.  What to do?

Instead of panicking - either hold fast in what you’ve got OR retreat but retreat to something YOUVE done research on and think is blue chip (for some it’s BTC, others it’s NEO, others it’s VeChain, others it’s some combo, etc etc).  That way even when “everything is going down”, if you took a few moonshots and they look terrible, you at least always KNOW where intermediate homebase is.  If you haven’t thought of this stuff yet, well you should have, but thankfully Reddit’s community has vetted certain names over and over again and for all the flack people here get, there actually ARE decent and great traders on this site.  If you’re invested and panicking and are a noob and don’t know the above names, get to work here and see which one of the names you like.

And, if you do do such a thing and retreat, I’d suggest just hanging on for a bit in that position. If your blue chip is getting hammered — well that’s just what sometimes happens in crypto, and a correction back up will occur because the underlying cryptofundamentals are, relatively speaking, good.  Also, note the overall marketcap - cryptoblues usually only get hammered when the ENTIRE marketcap is going down.  And if that’s happening, remember that history has recently shown that 100-200 billion dollar swings in the overall MC happen quite readily.  

Not rocket science but I feel today newbies might be nervous.  Keep your heads in the game.  As someone here once said, it takes balls of steel to create wealth - and those balls are only necessary when the market is going DOWN, not up."
Will China fail?,"Acemoglu’s work doesn’t describe a binary — there aren’t just failed or successful states — a country’s institutions can fall on a spectrum of more or less inclusive. 

Eg, maybe Sweden or wherever is extremely inclusive, Spain a little less so, Malaysia has serious flaws, and somewhere like Equatorial Guinea is a truly failed state. And each will reach some steady state economically — E. Guinea will have most people dirt poor until it has better institutions, Malaysia will be better off than most places but not truly rich, Spain will be rich but not as rich as it could be with better institutions, and Sweden will be somewhere near the top.

China went from having some of the worst institutions in the world, which caused mass famines, disease, suffering, and cultural destruction, to a place where most people can at least have a shot at an education, a modest wage, and can even maybe start their own business. Accordingly, they’ve gone from a dirt poor country to one that’s still fairly poor (gdp per capita is in the ballpark of Brazil or Mexico) but not destitute.

Maybe it will get better institutions, maybe worse, but one might expect it to stay about the same. And it could plausibly stay that way for a long time, and be quite stable. 

Maybe economic success has some link to stability, but that doesn’t mean somewhere economically unsuccessful can’t be politically stable for a very long time. It’s not a ticking time bomb.

Also, just because of Chinas sheer population, even reaching moderate success economically gives the CCP enough resources to be a superpower.

So, it’s complicated, but there’s no reason to expect an implosion just on economics alone."

I made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!,"&gt; I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. 
 
I was taught this as well. But it was because if I had money and didn't spend it, my parents would ""borrow"" it. 
 
And if I ever asked for them to pay me back, they'd say something like ""Well, if we're settling up who owes what, you owe us for food, board, your clothes, etc. etc. and you actually owe US $XYZ. Are you sure want to ask me for that money back?""
 
So I learned to: 
 
 a) spend it, b) hide it, c) lie about having it 
 
in that order. 
 
I had a weird moment of almost clarity when I did some work for my uncle and they paid me ~$300. And my aunt asked me how much of it I was going to save. And how my cousin saved almost everything but my other cousin spent most of what she earned.

Why is childcare so expensive when childcare workers get paid so little?,"It largely has to do with the staff to child ratio and how much people pay for childcare.  For example in preschool there are often 2 teachers for 20 children.  Take any price point and see just how much revenue such a class makes... Let's say it's $1,000 / month as a round number. This is [slightly above average](https://www.care.com/c/stories/2423/how-much-does-child-care-cost/) in the US, but costs vary regionally.

So, this is $20,000 in revenue per month if the 20-child class in at capacity. That's $240,000 per year in total revenue.  Two teachers means $120,000 in *revenue* for each teacher. If **all** the revenue went to the teachers that's the upper bound you'd expect.

Now, from that you have to account for many other costs: materials (toys, books, art supplies, furniture), facilities (rent / mortgage), utilities (electricity, water, garbage, heating), other staff (reception, administration), other business costs (marketing, accounting, insurance...).

So, it's reasonable to expect child care centers can only pay the actual care givers in the range $20,000 - $40,000."
Finally reached $50k in savings at 24 years old!,"Amazing work!

Not sure of your situation but I’m willing to bet that’s far more than 3-6 months pay.

What are the odds of getting scammed while buying a property?,"The banks have centralised catalogue of all the legal properties. If you go with SBI for your home loan then they BGC on the property/ builder/ scheme/ land for all legal documents &amp; approvals.
In addition to that you should demand the true copy of existing sales deed and run it through your lawyer. From safe guarding point, always go for agreement registration with all typical safe guards &amp; preconditions that need to be satisfied before the execution of sales deed.

From extra caution point, you should also investigate/ enquire about the history/ area of society about any issues ( noise, nasty neighbours, next door perpetually barking dog, problematic group accommodations with late night/ week end troubles, next door leased service apartment, safety/ crime rate, bad locality, health hazards / pollution, water logging, nearby hospital/ crematorium / wine shop/ school: all these good to have in the area but not next door!, legal status of internal open area of society/ any new DP road plan cutting through the society premises etc..) and do structural/ x_ray scanning from some engineer in case construction is old.
Also be very clear about additional stuff such as parking lot, water availability, any service &amp; maintenance dues from existing owner, issue getting NOC for sale from co- op society office/ builder: many times they demand black payments to issue one &amp; this need to be sorted out before hand with the current owner, any legal dispute involving the flat/society, any claims on same property by anyone else than the guy you are talking to, current name status of original electricity bill,  municipal  property tax receipt &amp; index II document( should be on current owner’s name)- also get it mentioned in agreement that owner will provide all required help and complete process of its transfer on your name with all dues paid beforehand. Also do demand and check original photo ID such as PAN, Passport, Aadhar etc. along with employment &amp; business details of owner at early stage. There is no need to be shy about these things as it’s a legal deal and it always pays to be assertive &amp; practical early than being sorry &amp; cheated later.

As a side concern, also do check if the property has any ‘vastu dosh ‘ e.g. main door facing south. Irrespective of whether you believe or not in these things, it makes reselling of such properties harder at right market price as many in India do believe in these things and avoid buying such homes. This may also be a good bargaining point if you are for long 15/20 year plan of staying in that home and don’t personally believe in such things. It’s all about doing cost- benefit analysis at personal level.

 Most important is don’t give a single penny as part of the transaction which is unaccounted for in any legal binding and each payment lot need to be legally traceable and mentioned in registered agreement before the final deed. Scammers rely on any such unaccountable payments/ advances to trap the buyers as no legal action can be taken for such cash/ black payments. There are certain sellers who purely buy the property for short term profiteering and such people rely on these dirty tactics to exploit buyers as in many cases they do not have all legal documents ready with them as the property is very new and/ or the owner wants to lock you down while he/ she hunts for other buyer quoting higher ticket price than agreed with you. Don’t fall for BS like ‘behen ki shaadi’, ‘hospital ka Kharcha ’ etc. used by these people to convince you in giving any unsecured advance money. Once any cash/DD/cheque is paid, they start demanding more money, time for delaying the sales deed or increase/ add black component for sale and refuse to return the paid advances/ token amount giving excuses like the money is spent. The agreement should also mention time bound repayment of any advance payments in case deed is not executed with all conditions satisfied in stipulated time period ( typically 2/3 months) post execution of an registered agreement.

To avoid most of these troubles, people hence prefer buying new flats (especially post RERA act) from reputed builders instead ( by giving due diligence to locality/ surrounding factors mentioned in 2nd para above.)

It goes without saying that all above points are general suggestions and you should involve legal expert/ lawyer during your transaction phase to be on a safer side."
Is it true that Argentina is a special case in economic studies?," The old saying is that there are four types of economies: Developed, Developing, Japan, and Argentina. 

I think this mostly has to do with the large amount of debt Argentina and Japan carry and for how long they've carried this relatively high leverage. In modern economics, it seems somewhat odd that this debt hasn't proven particularly unsustainable. The Japanese case mostly has to do with corporate and household savings rates (Japan being able to tax when they need to for revenue). Japan also uniquely seems to struggle with deflation because of these savings rates and currency speculation. 

I'm not as well read on Argentina, but one issue that has plagued Argentina for a long time is high inflation, although not hyperinflation like in Venezuela or Zimbabwe, just a relatively high inflation rate post-2000 (think 10%-50%). 

TLDR: Yes, Argentina (also Japan) are particularly interesting case studies in economics for a lot of economists."

What the heck is causing all of this inflation and recession news?,"We should almost have a FAQ about this...

Predictions of a recession / boom / anything else are rarely worth reading. If you want forward looking metrics search for leading indicators, but know they are not perfect: https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators

Anyone able to predict the future path of the economy could make a lot of money doing so. Anyone publicly publishing those predictions would be forgoing that benefit... See who is publishing these predictions, what track record they have, what incentives they may be hiding, and then decide if it's worth reacting to their predictions (it almost never is).

Most often the ""prediction"" that we are in a recession start to happen when we are already in one. This is because (by definition) we have need two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction... So whenever we have one quarter (note that 2022 Q1 real gdp was negative) then the predictions start flying fast and furiously (because what people are ""predicting"" is already half true) .

The reality is that the Fed started raising rates, so a deceleration in investment is expected. But this isn't news, it's something the Fed has announced publicly with a few months advance notice. *A slowdown is expected*. In fact, that's what the fed *wants*! But a slowdown and negative growth are different. Right now the best GDP predictors are all still positive for Q2. See for example: https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow

So things are slowing, which is what we expect because that's how we reduce inflation. By the way, are the same people predicting recession also deriding inflation? If so they likely have more of a political agenda than an economic one.

COVID threw almost every historic model for a loop (models not built on data that includes a pandemic won't predict accurately how a pandemic effects the economy). There are a significant number of one time events in the past two years meaning people can justify almost any prediction they want to. Not just Covid, but the resulting stimulus, the TCJA, supply chain disruptions, net zero / negative interest rates, and more...

Predicting macroeconomics is hard, and there's no punishment for getting it wrong. So it's safe to disregard the majority of what you read, they're more likely describing current conditions than future ones."
[ETH Daily Discussion] - 15/Jun/2017,"Hello Ethereum friends!
  
I just got back last night from a very long trip visiting family in a rural village in China. Suffice to say, I did not have internet for the past 1.5 months. So the last time I made a post here was around that time frame!
  
Let me just say: **WOW**
  
* This subreddit has EXPLODED in growth since I left ( ~16k hodlers)
  
* The last time I had internet, ETH price was in the $80-90s. I had dumped my savings into ETH when it was in the $50s, so I am **extremely happy** with what the price is right now.
  
* That flipper dolphin was around 30% when I left. The fact that it's like 80% now is insane. I wasn't expecting BTC parity until the end of the year to be honest!
  
* I've been slowly processing through all of the news that I've missed, and lets just say it has been nothing short of **overwhelmingly awesome**, especially the new EEA members last month. Chinese exchanges adding ETH is also pretty cool.
  
By the look of the charts, I understand we are undergoing a bit of a correction this week. I haven't really dug into the specific issues causing this retrace, but really... my expectations for the price coming back was **$150-200**. The fact that it has surged above $400 in such a short amount of time has annihilated my expectations. I am not surprised at all with this price drop. We can't expect prices to travel linearly upwards all the time after all.
  
So far from what I've read, there is absolutely nothing convincing me to jump ship from ETH. I am optimistic we will pull out of this correction and seek higher prices in the foreseeable future.
  
I still have a bunch of news to sift through, but wow, just wow. I am speechless at the growth of Ethereum just these past couple months!"
Argentina is going to freeze price of 1245 products for 90 days. What are the economic consequences we could expect and what are some successful examples of such policy?,"&gt;What are the economic consequences we could expect and what are some successful examples of such policy?

Shortages. And a black market where prices still go up *anyway*.

Price controls don't work, especially in a country where inflation is this high. It's a bandaid, and a useless one as well. Ending long running and substantial inflation as we see in Argentina generally requires drastic policy changes and is generally a result of gross mismanagement. Which is often why it survives, incompetent leadership isn't suddenly going to change their ways, and incompetent leadership is not ready to take the at times drastic steps to stop such a trend."

Daily Discussion,"Since I'm being criticized like I don't understand what a quality post here is supposed to look like, I'll give you an example:

Firstly, I always post charts. If you're confused at to what you're looking at, this is called ""Technical Analysis"", and a lot of people think it is the equivalent to asset astrology. They might not be totally wrong. 

The point is,  however, that these sort of charting principles are literally programmed into trading bots, and they perform *better than not having those factors included at all*.

If you'd like to learn more about TA, go to school at babypips.com, and understand it like it would be explained to a 5th grader. 

So first, let's look at a weekly chart of the ETH/USD price dating back to the first bubble.

[https://i.imgur.com/lfBars0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lfBars0.jpg)

This is how far back we have to go to find relevant *support* and *resistance* levels. These are prices that the asset tends to gravitate towards, based solely on historical levels. When the price approaches a former gravity point, it is considered **resistance**, until it breaks through this. When prices approach from below these levels, it is considered a ""sell"" or ""short"" signal, until it breaks through (with a reasonable error).

These sorts of price targets tend to be more meaningful when there arent **fundamental** factors (like news, economics, politics,etc) that are influencing the price. More on this later, but fundamentals *always* trump technicals.

Secondly, when a price breaks through resistance from below, that price point is now considered *support*. Based on that weekly chart. $850 was a frequent gravity point in what can be considered a giant head and shoulders pattern. That is your bottom ""long term"" support right now.

Resistance, here, is only the all time high. About $1450 depending on where you check. Expect there to be sell pressure here, based on nothing else except for the fact that it is the ATH. 

Now, for my *traders* on more frequent timeframes, let's take a look at the hourly chart:


 [https://i.imgur.com/xAaAWnM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xAaAWnM.jpg)

This sort of uptrend channel is very very typical. You see how it behaves within the bounds for the most part? Yeah, that's because the algos are charting this shit based on the same trendlines I'm drawing.

Typically, you get a ""sell"" or ""short"" signal when it breaks down out of this trendline pattern. Again, independent of fundamental factors, And youd start looking for temporary support/resistance levels the same way we did on the weekly (only now on a shorter timeframe). 

Doing so puts me around $970 with a downside target:****

[https://i.imgur.com/Wi8QeHZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Wi8QeHZ.jpg)

So all that being said, hilariously, I'm basically now going to tell you that although all of that charting is a worthwhile exercise, that is *NOT* what is primarily driving this market.

Ya'll need to be listening to CNBC in the morning, and hearing the hype crypto is starting to generate again. Bitcoin has basically been characterized as a ""store of value"" asset on the order of gold, and its anti-inflationary properties are being touted as ""unparalleled"" in a time where the fed is literally printing money out if their asses. This run was very well predicted this past summer, because of just that.

So why is Eth a laggard to bítcoin???? This shouldnt be surprising at all. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, the name recognition, and it's in the mouths of the pundits on CNBC. It IS the digital gold.

But that isnt where the crypto story ends, obviously. The utility of the blockchain is kind of the entire point of the tech, not as a store of value. The applications it has in so many industries (banking, credit, notaries, contracts, conditional wire transfers, wills, the list goes on and on)  is why this shit popped off in the first place (and why Eth nearly surpassed BTC in market cap). It's what drove the second wave of hype the last time. Expect it to happen again.

When the BTC market becomes saturated with exposure, expect Alts like Eth, OMG, LiteCoin, etc to dominate the ""Crypto talk"" news cycle, as investors who missed the BTC train scramble (again) to get exposure to the insane rally. 

The difference is, ETH now has ""Proof of stake"" and a million other actual applications on its resume from the past couple of years, and this will **very very** clearly separate it from the pack. Eth is a $2000 coin, and very soon. Just watch to see the conversation move towards the principles I've described. 

So the long and the short of this post. Buy and hold Eth now. This run is just getting started. If you want to trade on lower timeframes, go read up on TA and post charts/news. That is super fun and I love to see people doing that. It's a healthy market to have short sellers and traders. 

This is obviously a very long post, but the details I mentioned here is what comments should be based around here; not simply reaction to every little price move. 

Hope this can be an example of how to  make this forum a better place."
"If perpetually borrowing money is irresponsible and unsustainable at the level of the individual, why is it commonplace and orthodox policy at the macroeconomic level?","&gt;When it comes to policy at state and international level, however, this type of thing seems to be the norm. Nations behave like an individual maxing out credit cards to sustain a lifestyle they can't pay for, which eventually must come crashing down.

Countries aren't people.

&gt; I know that in theory, governments should take advantage of economic cycles, borrow money during bad times to stimulate the economy and keep the coffers full, then run a budget surplus when the good times are back and pay off all debts until the next economic downturn.

Countries should spend *more* during downturns and *less* during upswings. That doesn't mean they have to pay off all of their debt.

&gt;Are the governments of the world aware that economies running on borrowed money is unsustainable, and simply lack the political will to do anything about it because of how unpopular measures to correct this would be, so kick the can down the road for the next people in power or until the whole system collapses? Or do the rules that apply to individuals not apply to economies, and debt can continue forever sustainably? It is assumed you can continue to borrow perpetually if growth outstrips debt? Isn't this assumption irresponsible, then?

Countries aren't households and their debts don't work the same. If you spend money, it's most likely on consumption. That's good for you, but it's spending that doesn't generate income.

A balanced budget is often not even desirable for governments because the economy would be better off if the government spends more money. [Also, for some countries, the US for example, debt has had a *negative* cost for long periods of time.](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/11/how-expensive-is-it-to-service-the-national-debt/) Meaning it would actually ""cost"" more not to take on this debt.

Governments spending money *generally* leads to more growth in the future, thus higher government revenues, so servicing their debt is not an issue. Basically, if spending a dollar means getting &gt;$1 in return in the future, that's fine.

Doesn't mean government spending can't ever turn into a problem. Part of why this works is that debt is very cheap for governments to take on, but that's only cheap as long as the government is seen as stable and trustworthy. During the last recession, Greece was in a bad position because it was discovered that a lot of money was wasted, the government falsified reports, etc. And as trust goes down, risk and in turn interest rates go up, borrowing gets substantially more expensive and eventually no longer sustainable because the cost of servicing debt far exceeds the benefit of taking on that debt."
What's your day to day life as an economist like?,"I work for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and it really depends on the day. Today I have 5 meetings and almost no free time, but other days I have no scheduled meetings or due dates so I can freely work on my research (which is currently a methodological justification for using medians on the Consumer Expenditure Survey) Around certain times of the year when we release our data we are extremely busy checking the data, running the codes and preparing the releases for the public. I also work on other teams and divisions in BLS as our budget is pretty tight so many times supervisors will pull in other people from other branches or sections for extra help especially when time is a factor for certain things. I also help answer public comments on our website, update the website, and run our yearly public workshop. We also get to travel and present our research at economic conferences though since I started during covid they have all been done virtually."
How much are you down from you investment?,"I am still way up from my initial investment as I got into crypto early 2016 when prices were crazy low but definitely down a lot on potential profits. I mean at peak Jan valuations, I literally had fuck you money on paper but now it feels like a distant dream again. I did cash out quite a bit in late Dec which is probably why I am still sane. I should have cashed out everything but hindsight is a bitch.

I can only imagine how hard it would have been if I invested during the bubble and had to experience 95% of my money going down the drain. It takes a lot of character and strength to hold yourself together in these tough times, especially if you have invested significant sums like me. So hats off to the newbies who invested in Jan and are still here and holding strong despite the massacre. If you can make it through this bear, you can make it through anything in future.

I know wisdom says you should only invest what you are willing to lose but in my case, I didn't have much that I could lose. So I invested money that I couldn't afford to lose because I knew that you can only get rich by taking exceptional risk when you werem't born with a silver spoon. I was willing to tough it out for a few years and live like a beggar if things didn't work out. I mentally prepared myself for the hard life but thankfully it did work out."
How does money have value?,"Yes, for ""normal"" fiat money this is definitely true.

Basically, $10 have the value of $10 because you can buy $10 worth of goods with them. $10 worth of bananas, or screws, or Pokémon cards, or weed, or whatever. You could buy the same stuff for the same $10 tomorrow and you could have done the same yesterday.

People have faith in the USD being stable and reliable and that faith is verified every day because every day people go out and spend USD and get the value they expect.

While the USD isn't technically backed by anything, you could look at it in the sense of being ""backed"" by the entire US economy because all the USD out there can buy all the goods and services offered in the US.

Cryptocurrencies behave differently. Their value doesn't come from your ability to freely and reliably exchange them for goods and services.

There are basically two angles you can take.

First, you could say that *today*, no you can't purchase a lot with them, but you will be able to in the future, once they take hold in the economy and become widely used an accepted. They still have value because of their ability to purchase goods and services, it's just that the point where they have that ability lies in the future.

Or you could say, well it's a bubble. It has value because people think it does and think it will gain value over time. Of course if it never actually has any ""real"" value, the bubble will eventually collapse and cryptocurrencies will return to their ""real"" value, which is nothing.

The truth lies probably somewhere in between those two extremes. Really, we don't know yet. At least some cryptocurrencies certainly *could* become useful currencies in the future, we don't know yet."

Why should I take home loan?,"I don't think this is the right calculation. Let me know where I am wrong.

1. Do you have 50L outright to invest in mutual funds? If not, this calculation is just useless as even though you **could** get those returns, you **will not** as there are no investments made.
2. 20% over 5 years? Highly optimistic.
3. 20% on 50L is 10L if you are talking about the net return over 5 years. 20% CAGR on 50L over 5 years is \~74L (profit). Highly highly highly unlikely.
4. You will be saving 20k in rent each month, but you will also be paying **1L** in EMI each month (taking the same parameters, 8% interest and 5 years period). Albeit you will be gaining equity on the house, what is important to consider is, would this difference of 80k/month yield better returns in mutual funds as SIP or not. That is a better comparison IMO.
5. The maintenance costs of a house can make the ownership experience a sore point. Also, in India, especially in cities like Delhi and Mumbai where the market is highly inflated, 50L may not buy you the quality of the house that 20k/month would let you rent.
6. Another major factor to consider is liquidity. A house, while gives a permanent roof over your head, isn't liquid. In case of an emergency, you will have to sell the house below the market price for quick money. It can be tedious and time-consuming, in addition to incurring a potential loss.
7. Appreciation: Houses are not appreciating the way they were. The real estate market is inflated already, don't expect it to grow the way it has been so far.

Edit: Having said all that, it is as much of a psychological question as it is a financial decision. Peace of mind is important and it is up to the individual to put a price on that, after considering all the variables.

Edit 2: u/aragorn2308 shared a video that is aimed at the Canadian market but it gives a very valid point. Cost of Equity. This is the opportunity cost of locking the down payment, 12.5L in this case into an illiquid asset. That needs to be factored in too. [Video](https://youtu.be/Uwl3-jBNEd4)"

What is causing the price of so many goods and services to skyrocket?,"It's a complicated question. A short answer might includes things like:

1. Supply chain hiccups in various intermediate components and raw materials during the pandemic leading to shortages in finished goods, driving up prices
2. Poorly managed health risks in workplaces and reduced availability of things like suitable child care have reduced the available labor pool of people willing to work for lower wages; this hasn't seemed to raise wages yet but reduced labor availability can lead to reduced output and shortages
3. (controversial/dubious) stimulus payments and increased UI benefits may have reduced the opportunity cost of not working, further reducing labor supply
4. demand spikes from relaxed restrictions
5. aggregate effects of stimulus policies reaching markets for consumer goods
6. it just might *seem* like prices are skyrocketing now just because inflation has been so low for so long

And FWIW, most lumber is produced domestically or in Canada, and most to all of P&amp;G's diapers for the US market are produced domestically too. The recent gas spike is likely at least partially a result of the Colonial pipeline cyberattack causing supply shortfall and uncertainty."
Why are you investing in dividend stocks?,"Basically I have a monkey brain, and having a passive income stream makes me happier than the logical benefit of having growth stocks. Even selling a periodic amount of my growth stocks each month/quarter/year doesn't do it for me. I want hands off, hands free passive income straight to my dome.   


I feel like each person is pre-disposed to a certain type of investing, and as long as you aren't taking your savings to the casino, you can save and invest in many ways and still be successful."
Would universal basic income basically drive up the price of everything?,"It depends on how you finance it.

If you finance it via money creation, you get higher inflation.

If you finance it via redistribution, e.g. taxes, you don't necessarily end up with inflation. You will get higher demand for some goods and it's perfectly possible that goods bought by poor(er) people will go up in price. That doesn't mean you get a (significant) increase in the general price level."
2008 Housing Crash - Why not pay the mortgages instead?,"I can see a few reasons for not doing that, first the cost. Wether you pay everyone’s loans off or just some loans, the size would be higher than TARP anyway. Especially since you’re not getting back that money, the goal of TARP wasn’t to make money at all but it was at least repaid in nominal terms.

The biggest reasons against it would be that paying back a loan destroys money. It’s counterintuitive, I know, but when you repay a loan, the size of a bank balance sheet actually decreases : banks wouldn’t really be filled with money after loan repayments. (In short, you drastically reduced a banks ability to make loans or act as a primary dealer.) Also, destroying money during a crisis is the last thing you want to do.

As for moral hazard, while bank were bailed out and then repaid it. After that they were slapped by a ton of national and international regulation, hence avoiding moral hazard. The 2020 pandemic is a good example of that, we went from US Banks being the problem in 2008 to being the solution in 2020 with PPP loans, PDCF and other programs.

To conclude the big problem in 2008 was uncertainty, no one knew what they had and if everything was going to default. In hindsight we noticed that while tranches below AAA defaulted a lot, AAA tranches were very resilient. And AAA tranches represented about 80% of the MBS market. We probably would have ended up paying off much more loans that those who would have defaulted. We didn’t know what was going to happen, repaying loans implies that we had a lot of information (and time) about what was actually going on."
is recession the only way out of inflation in all history?,"The best example of something that causes downward pressure on prices without causing a recession and/or depressed growth would be a big technological shift in an economy, which is something the government can’t really plan on. 

In theory, the government could also invest in things that could lower the cost of production. This could be better general infrastructure or energy infrastructure."
Uber Fined $649 Million for Saying Drivers Aren’t Employees,"This is B.S.

"Any black people in here? If so, what was your story? Any unique challenges along the way?","I’m a fellow Black person. I’m not a millionaire but I’m under 30 and have more than a years salary invested... this is after paying off all of my student debt half a year ago. 

I have been privileged. My mother is a hard worker, smart and just received her PhD. She taught me to be independent from a young age in an unorthodox way that even surprised her when I mentioned it to her, but it helped shape who I became. 

My mom was also a very prudent person and always tried to save a buck with a coupon, or etc no matter how much money she made and that had an effect, as I’m similar although not as extreme. We also used to be poor as she was a single mom just trying to make ends meet, but we’ve never lived in a ghetto. At worst, from my memory as a kid, we slept on a mattress on a bedroom floor at a rented apartment where my little brother would continuously pee the mattress 😂

One thing she hasn’t taught me well however is personal finance. While she is doing excellent financially, now and even has a financial advisor/tax strategist that would make a simple man envy, I learned personal finance on my own... college was over, student loans kicked in, I was $45K in debt. I gave up, said I will live with this debt for the rest of my life.

About 2 years into my career, everyone was leaving my workplace for some reason... one person mentioned how someone who left was making double what I was making in half the timeframe while doing a travel position. I thought, if I could try that, I can live on a portion of money and use the rest to pay off my debt, and I did exactly that. 1 year later from that day, I paid off all of my debt

During that time I was very aggressive, and I mean very... I sent half of every paycheck to debt and had apps that took money from my bank account for investments/extra money I can throw at debt. I also watched a lot of personal finance videos, learned about FIRE, and how to be smart financially

I consider my Mom wealthy, but she says I was smarter about my money, and at a younger age 

I also have a hobby that have doubled in revenue year over year for the past 3 years. Doesn’t make as much as my main job but it has at least been in the 5 figures

I’m not rich but I’m now nearing a 6 figure net worth which in fatfire I’m sure isn’t much. I treat myself as if I’m paying off debt still, except I send the money to investments and I still live relatively comfortably while living below my means (major key 🔑)

After I hit the net worth mark, my next financial goal is to save for and own an investment property and go from there"
In 3 days I'll have the most money I've had in my life so far,"Step 1: pay off debt
step 2: make a monthly budget using whatever income you will be getting from your job. 
Step 3: put what ever remains of your inheritance in to the stock market. I would suggest Index funds. 
Step 4: do not let your lifestyle creep up. Meaning don’t go out buying cars, boats and RV or any other useless things.
Step 5: enjoy your new found financial freedom!"

Yeah right... the typical post over there is more like, ""My dad just passed away and left me on my own with nothing but a measly 8 million dollars. Should I invest it and live off the interest, or put it in savings for a rainy day? I need your help, or I'll be homeless by tomorrow. (Homeless means you can't afford a second home, right?)"""
Should I bail on crypto?,"Here’s an example to put this in perspective. 

Netflix generates 2.5 billion a month and bitcoin generates $0 per month yet Netflix has dropped 70%

All tech stocks with solid companies have plummeted. These companies generate billions a month and have thousands of employees. There’s no way they drop that hard and don’t bring bitcoin down with it. Moral of story is it’s not just bitcoin."
"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","First of all, companies aren't people, and they get treated differently. They also have different needs.

We are fairly generous with people. You can certainly argue about the extend of the stimulus and other measures, but the fact is that we are just talking about payments, more or less no strings attached.

We are typically *not* that generous with companies. The government is much more stringent about the actual needs and typically gives out loans, or pays cash in exchange for shares at rock bottom prices, things of that nature. The government turned a direct profit from the TARP bailouts from the last financial crisis for example. Yes, the government gives these companies huge amounts of cash, but loaning millions of dollars is obviously not quite the same as *handing out* millions of dollars.

Also, obviously these are stopgap measures, especially during a pandemic. If we're being optimistic, they will last a year or two.

Also, especially right now, we're talking about exogenous events, events ""outside"" of these businesses. Airlines don't fail because they didn't manage their business well or because people don't want to fly any more, airlines fail because people literally aren't *allowed* to use them. Restaurants don't fail because they don't make good food or their prices are too high, they fail because they are literally *told to shut down*.

Crises providing some good or ""necessary"" ""culling"" or weeding out of ""bad"" companies is by and large a myth that doesn't hold. Especially not right now.

Actually quite the opposite. For airlines for example, some people feared that without bailouts, bigger players that would be able to survive the pandemic in better shape, more or less just by virtue of being *bigger*, would just buy up smaller competitors, leading to higher market concentration, higher prices and ultimately a worse position for consumers.

Not to mention other costs. A business that fails and has to start over costs more and takes more time than a business that can survive the crisis relatively unscathed. You can retain more jobs during the crisis, and you can get back to pre-crisis levels much faster, which means a stronger economy and more jobs. We want to beat the pandemic and get back to normal, not beat the pandemic and spend the next couple of years rebuilding."
Just hit $3.2M in net worth today,"Great post man! I know you want a bigger stack of money but with $3.2M you can spend 128K a year and never run out of money! (4% rule... assuming you got your money invested and a 8% annual return). 

I'm curious, where are you from? How difficult was to migrate?
I'm a 23yo (male) from Mexico. I studied aeronautical engineering but currently unemployed. I have the opportunity to move to the US and work as a truck driver (the pay is not bad and it's easier and faster to start working in the trucking industry than in the aerospace industry). A good job in Mexico as an engineer would pay around 20k a year but there's no way I can get that type of job with no experience, it would take me at least 6 more years to star earning that. In the other hand, a truck driver earns around 52k in their first year and they can start earning a lot more with just 3 years of experience.

I want to be an engineer but the pandemic has affected greatly all types of jobs but specially the aeronautical industry. I feel I can achieve fatFIRE faster by working as a truck driver in the US, but I don't want to leave my family, it's so difficult for me. Was it also difficult for you?"

Why a diversified etf portfolio might perform worse than just one etf,"Okay. I see your point here. Keep it simple, Buy 1 ETF index covering the world. Input money over time into this single ETF and use dollar cost averaging over time to reduce volatility. Long term Buy and Hold strategy. 

Why chase after the latest ETFs with high performance?  Solar ETF TAN had a 234% return last year, ARKG ETF had 181% return last year. YOLO, cannabis ETF has return of 90% the last 13 weeks. 

* TAN ETF inception date is 4/15/2008 and **10 year return is 6.55%**
* ARKG ETF Inception date is 10/30/2014 and 5 year return is 36.7% and lifetime return is impressive 29.&amp;5. 
* YOLO is the latest high flyer with inception date of 4/17/19 and lifetime return of **minus -16.5%.** 

These high rates of return is not sustainable. Your chasing high performance which will most likely return to normal rates of return.  All this could be counterproductive. 

**Lets see if this works in the long run.** 

Let's go with Vanguard total world stock index, VT. This ETF inception date is 06/24/2008. Expense ratio expense very low at 0.08%. VT covers 98% of the domestic and emerging markets holding **8825 stocks.**

VT inception date is 6/24/2008 and returns are 12.5% over 5 years and 9.3% over 10 years.

But if you look at ARK funds their active strategy is  selecting companies with innovation in technology that should displace traditional company incumbents and gain market share.  

ARK funds focus on innovated disruptive technology. Next generation internet, cloud computing, robotics and other automation, genomic DNA sequencing for health treatment. 

I realize Vanguard world stock ETF will integrate these new innovational stocks into their overall blend, but is a low 3% of overall fund. 

But ARK funds avoids the slow dying big companies which places a drag on the overall portfolio performance.

Some of the Large CAP under performing companies dragging down the VT includes Ford, F, with 1.2% over 10 years and GM with 6.6% 10 year return.  Walgreens retailer, WBA, has had minus -6.6% return over past 5 years dropping from $97 in 2015 to $49 today. 

ARKK is an Active ETF and their research teams rebalance their ETF, so you don't have to look elsewhere for new opportunities.  They do the exploring work for you. 

The standard I am using is VT, Vanguard world stock ETF, 8825 stocks with very low expense ratio of 0.08% with returns are 12.5% over 5 years and 9.3% over 10 years. 

**Can we improve on the single world stock ETF of VT with 9.3% over 10 years and still keep it simple?**

Keep the Vanguard world stock fund but supplement this single fund to boost returns.  Use 10 year returns for postulating future returns.

New blend of 5 EFTs with 10 year returns if available, then not then use ETF lifetime returns.

* GO with **80% VT**  = 9.3% over 10 years. 

Then add 4 more ETFS at 5% each for the 20% leftover. Go with 4 ETFS in different fields of semi-conductors, technology, biotech and innovation.   

* Semi-conductors EFTs, SOXX 22.7% over10 years, inception date of 07/10/2001. started just right before stock market crash after 9/11/2001. 5 year return of 35%. 
* VGT, Vanguard Tech ETF Index, inception date 1/26/2004, lifetime return of 13% with 343 stocks long  = 20.5% over 10 years. 
* XBI, Biotech ETF, inception date 1/31/2006, lifetime return 15.8% and 21.3% over 10 years. 
* ARKK, active innovation ETF with 48 stocks long, inception date 10/30/2014, will use 36.1% return over lifetime ( &gt; 6 years) versus 45.5% return over 5 years. 

Vanguard VGT has no overlap to XBI, 5% overlap to ARKK and 17% overlap to SOXX.

New rate of return is calculated to be:

* 80% VT = 9.3%
* 5% SOXX= 22.7%
* 5% VGT  = 20.5%
* 5% XBI = 21.4%
* 5% ARKK = 36.1%

New rate of return is 12.47% with mix of 80% VT and 20% other. Improvement from 9.3% to 12.48%. 

Calculation:  \[ (8x9.3) +(0.5) (22.7+20.5+21.4+36.1) /10 \]  = 12.48%

**Lets improve and simplify even more and go with simple 2 fund mix of 80% VT and 20% ARKK.** This could be consider cherry picking. But sing a lifetime return rate over 6 years is all I got. 

* 80% VT = 9.3%
* 20% ARKK = 36.1%

***Postulated improvement of returns from 9.3% to 14.66% returns.*** 

The bottom line is instead of a single ETF covering entire world, go with a **ETF hybrid mix**  between slow and steady VT covering entire world and some ARKK to boost returns from 9% to 15%.  The overlap of VT to ARKK is only 3%. VT will only capture 3% of ARKK returns.  

**Don't have a portfolio of high flying ETFS without a CORE investment.**  Watch for extreme overlap and duplication of your investments. The website below calculates ETF stock duplication.  QQQ has 41% duplication to SPY, **78% of stocks inside QQQ are also in SP 500**, SPY. Would you hold both QQQ and SPY together?

[**https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php**](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php)

Core investments being VT, Vanguard world stocks or others such as S&amp;P 500 index fund, SPY, or IWF- iShares Large cap US growth, then supplement the core holding with other satellite holdings to boost your returns, IWM, Russell 2000 small caps, ARKK, SOXX, XBI and others.

I hate to use a sport analogy but a baseball player starting off hitting 14 home runs in the first month of season, April, is not going to reached the projected 84 home runs for the season. In 2006 , Albert Pujols started with 14 HRs in April 2006 and end up with 49 Home runs, well below the 84 home runs projected.

**Tesla stock had a 740% increase in 2020,** Opening at Jan 02 at $84.90 and closing at $700 on Dec 31. Tesla stock would need to go from $700 to $4480 in 2021 to repeat 2020 performance.  This is highly unlikely.  Likewise any ETF with short term high returns is not likely to repeat going forward. Chasing recent high returns of 4 weeks or 13 weeks could be counter productive.  Look for the 3 year, 5 year and 10 year and lifetime returns on selection of ETFs. Maintain Core investments and then add some satellite EFTs.

***That's the beauty of ETFs.*** *Buying $1000 of VT gives you exposure to 8825 stock around the world at a very low cost. Impossible to duplicate yourself on buying 8000 stocks 1 by 1 individually.  Same thing with core investments SPY S&amp;P 500 and IWM, Russell 2000 small caps.*"
"35, starting my financial life now. Is it worth it?","First of all, start budgetting. Secondly, find some buddy to help you with your finances. In the Netherlands for example we have Humanitas, which has a program where financially savvy volunteers are matched with people who need to get their finances in order, to help teach them financial literacy. There is probably something like that where you live too. If I were in your position, I'd certainly try to find help like this.

Third, your post reads as if you are still pretty depressed and have a negative outlook on life. Your mindset of thinking you already ruined your life is not helping you, and is of no use at all.

"What's a good idea at first glance but when you think like an economist, it's not a good idea anymore?","A good current example is how some countries are subsidizing gasoline and/or natural gas (or price ceilings) in Europe at a time when there are supply decreases. Sounds great! Something is more expensive, magically make it less expensive! However, a subsidy is a negative tax, artificially increasing demand just when you are worried about people using ""too much"" of something causing price spikes. Right now supply is very inelastic, so the only way out is to allow the price increases to decrease quantity demanded.

Instead of subsidizing the exact things that are temporarily more scarce, if you are worried about the effect on poor people, you should give them money.  This lessens the shock to these people, and at least gives them a chance of spending the money on a substitute good (perhaps they will buy a heat pump instead of using natural gas to heat their houses)."

Does anybody else find being poor absolutely exhausting?,"Absolutely.

I’ve had the privilege of getting a new job a couple years ago that increased my salary $10,000. Within a few months, I slowly started to feel different. Like I had more energy and more free time. It wasn’t until I was paid and still had a couple hundred left over from last paycheck that I realized what changed—my brain wasn’t constantly thinking about money. I had time to worry about other stupid things. 

Being poor is like being in an emotionally abusive relationship. 

Side note: the job I got I didn’t qualify for. I just pretended I was qualified, made the interviewer laugh and seem personable (not me at all) and got it. Then worked my ass off to learn the job and prove I was a good employee.

Edit: appreciate the award all. If you have the funds, give to some shelter or program in your local area for me. Or give a compliment—those do wonders too."

In October all 3 projects were delivered and all running smoothly, I requested a review again.

He gave me another 2%!!!!! And I humbly accepted. It was a Friday.

Could not sleep through the weekend thinking about it.

Said to him, look I am grateful, but I feel I did not have the chance to say what was my expectation. I was think more around “x” it was 15%.

"
Is it really true that worldwide open borders would increase world gdp by roughly 50-150%?,"As others have said, the paper is reliable in the sense it reflects academic consensus. But modelling on situations that have never happened before should be taken with a grain of salt.

If every nation suddenly opened their borders, there would probably be a net benefit to GDP. Would the benefit to GDP be 50 to 150%? Maybe. Its only a best guess.

You also have to reflect on how different cohorts of the population are affected. The poorest in the world would benefit the most being able to move to richer countries to work. Some of the existing poor in richer countries might suffer because of the massive influx in competition for menial labour. And of course, capital would benefit a lot fuelling inequality.

In that sense, it would probably just be like globalisation on steroids. Massive boosts to GDP and decreases in absolute poverty but with great increases in inequality, communities torn apart etc.

And then there are the unexpected consequences...

Edit: Changed the wording to remove some of the certainty around the existing poor being harmed by immigration. There is mixed evidence on this point."
Why is Africa so much poorer than Europe?,"There is no one answer to this. In my own studies of the cultural reasons I mainly came across the ""extractive institutions"" approach of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson and the effects of slavery empirically studied by Nunn.

Yes, I agree that it **may** be naive to think that colonialism accounts for the entire discrepancy between wealth across continents. However, it would be just as naive to think that it has not played a significant role. Institutions play a large role in the long-term wealth of a nation. If, for some reason, western colonialists installed more exploitative institutional systems in Africa compared to in North America, this effect can persist for a long time. I have read several hypotheses on why different institutional systems may be installed by colonialists but the factor that seemed most credible to me is the preexisting conditions for Europeans to settle in the colony.

Going down the slavery route, Nunn found that, within Africa, countries exhibit less trusting cultures if more slaves had been ""stolen"" during 1400-1900. African slaves were mostly captured by fellow Africans and possibly even friends and relatives. Culture persists through generations and it is not controversial to believe that less trust is detrimental to growth. Just imagine allocating capital efficiently in a society where the lenders don't trust the borrowers.

Edit: Typo in controversial."

U.S. population barely grows; annual housing construction is 1.5 million. So how did we end up in a housing shortage? Is the market distorted by tax code?,"The issue isn't so simple so that you can just take total supply and population. Each state, county, and metro area have different zoning and land regulations which can influence housing price. Furthermore, housing is a heterogeneous good, meaning they are all different. It also doesn't change the fact that real income change and costs of living are different in each state. Furthermore, the consumers of housing can vary. 

The consumers of housing have different preferences. There are factors such as different household sizes, age groups, martial status, and income. Preferences for apartments, condos, row housing, single family, can all affect housing prices. 

While we would like to simplify the problem of housing, its a field where planners and economists spend a great deal of time trying to figure out the problem. Because the housing market is far from an ideally perfectly working market. As its ripe with market failures."

Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story,"Erik, 

A long time ago, in 1995, I was the first person banned from the Internet, and my case was in the news.  An honest journalist once told me something very important that I never forgot.  I was asking him if he could include certain things in his article.  He said:

&gt; ""Chris, you have to understand that journalists are not your PR agency.  Journalists have their own agenda.  They are going to write whatever story they want to, or whatever story their editor told them to write.""

Any honest journalist will tell you something similar.  Unfortunately, not enough journalists care about writing an accurate story.

"What would it take for you to say, ""yep, value investing is dead.""","Buying things at a good value is ingrained in me, so it can never die. If people at Walmart start paying $100,000 for a liter of coke, I will buy Pepsi for $1 even though I think Coke is better because a liter of Coke isn't worth $100,000 to me personally. If every soda goes up to $100,000 per liter, I will buy juice instead of soda. It's the same for stocks with me, I will buy a stock for what I think it's worth.

Proof that GME Order Flow is Being Manipulated,"Uh... Well, yeah. That's why we're all here, pissed off and yelling about it. There's actually even a ton of related terrible shit that's adjacent to what you've covered here.

For example, in the rare instances that retail bids hit lit markets like the NYSE or IEX, the bids are generally immediately matched by institutional sells, and just bundled into a bid-pack that gets dumped into dark pools. E.g., [here's me answering a question about someone buying shares at a price of $153.962265](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyl0xu/four_decimal_points_aint_enough_do_i_hear_six/h7tzswd/?context=3), where you could see the bundling happen in the immediately following seconds of market traffic. That shit happens *ALL THE TIME*. I'm not sure people understand that the constant ""~50% dark pool volume"" we see effectively means 100% of retail buy orders end up there, because the ""50% lit volume"" being reported is just retail *trying* to force orders onto lit exchanges. It ends up at 50/50 because it's a double-counting of lit retail orders, thanks to them being universally bundled up and routed to dark pools.

[Also, they even get to attach tags to orders like ""BD EXHAUST""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qbjj4a/holy_shit_4_something_really_fucky_with_options/hhavgxa/) (BD = broker-dealer, and ""exhaust"" being the leftover order flow after the BD takes their shot at internalizing it) to flag order flow coming out of retail brokers, which helps call out retail-specific market activity to collude against."
I think there's a debt crisis coming in the UK. Am I wrong? How do we hedge?,"My bet is that Europe is potentially heading for lower growth and falling yields, so this means European government bonds should rally within the coming years. The Vanguard U.K. Long Duration Gilt Index Fund has fallen 29% since December (and even more since May 2020!), however my thoughts are this could rally if/when the UK enters a recession in the coming year. The Bank of England are forecasting there will be little to no economic growth in the UK for the next three years. Surely this will means inflation will fall and this will be a good thing for UK gilts, and could send them back up towards all time highs.

Are there any people invested since the 2000 bubble?,"&gt;How was the market sentiment back then?

I've been investing since 1992.  The market was very different back then.  Except for the 1998-1999 dot com, there really was not the wide-spread mania behind stocks for most normal folks.  Trading costs were a lot higher (a discount brokerage commission was $10 a lot, and options trades were much higher, $25-35 a trade minimum).  We didn't have widespread social media focused on investments now (there were some niche AOL, Compuserve, and usenet groups, but they didn't attract millions of users).

So, today's mania is different from what I've seen in my lifetime, which is very widespread gambling by people without much means, fueled by huge wins on social media (hello, Roaring Kitty), and enabled by easily available information and very low trading costs.  On top of that, long-term bond rates are the lowest they've been in my lifetimes, so otherwise conservative investors are putting most of the investment into equities.

&gt;it's not a healthy way for society to have so many market participants chasing short-term gains

Whether it's healthy or not remains to be seen.  People will always chase what they see as an easy route to riches.  In the US, it just happens to be stock, most other countries, it's real estate.  In some ways, today's environment is good for the average investor with much better investment disclosures, the internet, cheap trading costs, and amazing liquidity in ETF's and options.   It's the current valuation environment that is poor, but that can change very quickly."
The sleight of hand that every investor should be aware of,"Now try to account for employee share purchase plans and retirement account matching that are also a variable in the figures you’re looking at. 

IE: How does employees locking up part of their wages and bonuses for extended periods of time in shares impact the cash flows of the business. 

The figures you’re looking at are after all a smaller portion of the pie than the whole picture. Like if I set aside 15% of my wages and apple were to add 15% to my stock purchase value after 6 months sure they’re paying me an extra 2250 on my share purchase at the end of the term but they also benefit from 15000 cash flow for a set period of time if my annual wage is 100k. 

These are all equivalent of short term loans to the company that they try to capitalize on while also creating an incentive system for employee retention since the employee doesn’t get the benefit for the full term when they leave and it’s structured like a never ending carrot and stick. 

In the end this type of structure is extremely financially beneficial to the company."

How much did slaves contribute to America's success?,"There's two versions of this question: what did African Americans contribute and how would that contribution have been different if they were paid as free labour, not slaves. I'm going to address the second question, as I have some sources to hand. 

For a start, clearly the American economy, outside the southern States, continued to prosper after its Civil War. Even the classic slave produced good, cotton continued to be produced in rising numbers. US cotton exports continued after the civil war. The US's Federal Reserve in [May 1923 published an article on cotton financing](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/FRB/1920s/frb_051923.pdf). As part of this, they discussed cotton exports, and published a table (page 567 or 33 in the pdf), showing cotton exports of 1.9 million bales in 1850 and 2.9 million bales in 1870, rising up to a high of 10.7 million bales in 1911.

And this was despite a drop in labour inputs: The end of slavery *is* estimated to have resulted in newly freed cotton workers reducing their labour supply by up to a third (as an aside, in and amongst the various miseries of the Black experience in the US South I like to dwell on this good news - that emancipated people gained that improvement in their lives). Interestingly, cotton productivity relative to labour is estimated to have gone up during this period despite the fall in hours worked: the hours of labour required to produce a 100 lb of cotton lint was estimated at 82 in 1860 and 68 in 1870 (Craig and Weiss, 2000, page 8): cotton pickers may have been working fewer hours, but they were working more efficiently.

US cotton did have an advantage in world markets independent of slavery: a particular variety of cotton, G. hirsutum, made for very nice cotton and US slaveholders developed varieties that grew particularly well in the climate and soil conditions of the US south (Olmstead and Rhode, 2008). Adapting this variety to other primary cotton-growing regions of the world, was a much slower process.

The other side is that US industrialision started in the northern states, where slavery was illegal. There are long arguments about whether the industrialisation was financed by cotton, or perhaps cotton was a retardant. The question of US industrialisation is why did the US industrialise rather than remain a primary producer like Canada or Australia or NZ, focused on trading agricultural and mining products to Europe in exchange for manufactured goods? One argument is the US's tariffs, introduced to protect US manufacturers. If it had not been for exports of slave-produced goods like cotton or tobacco, then the US$ real exchange rate would have presumably been higher against the European currencies, providing a similar incentive to domestic manufacturing.

Finally, slavery was by its nature a violent and destructive process, naturally prompting resistance by its victims. Given the evidence that social trust is important for economic prosperity, slavery's legacy plausibly continues to reduce economic output today.

$26 Should Be The Minimum Wage According to MIT (read),"Personally, I feel like a blanket minimum wage is the worst possible option. I think it should algorithmic based on COL for each county. It should also be automatically updated each year. Housing costs, grocery costs, transportation costs, etc..

$8 minimum wage could be fine for a small rural town, but absolutely unlivable in a high cost of living area. $25-$30 minimum wage could be fine for a high cost of living area, but it would absolutely devastate a low cost of living area. People would have to move as businesses would shut down, but people wouldn’t be able to move because nobody would buy their homes.

Automatically updated minimum wages by county would find the optimal value for everybody and would benefit the local and national economy. We also wouldn’t ever have to deal with it ever again. By the time we increase minimum wage nationwide, it’s pretty much time to do it again."
Is there an economics term for this?,"The bias that the seller exploits in this example is called anchoring in behavioral economics. It is explained ([here](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/04/01/the-anchoring-effect)) as follows: ""The tendency for a person to rely heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making decisions is known as the anchoring effect.2 The anchoring effect is a type of cognitive bias—a systematic error in thinking that affects people's judgment and decisionmaking. Anchoring plays a role in decisions that involve numerical values such as prices."""
"Why does Sweden prefer taxing income and consumption, rather than capital?","People get confused over capital income taxation. Consumption taxation schemes like X tax end up looking almost identical to corporate income tax schemes, but the key difference is that consumption taxes have a constant implicit rate with respect to time while capital income taxes do not. **This is an extremely disireable property** and its why many countries prefer consumption taxation. This is not an easy thing to grasp but once you understand this distinction I think it becomes a lot more clear how it's possible for consumption taxes to be progressive. 

[My comment here goes over the difference in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/huy7cu/the_single_family_homes_sticky_20_july_2020/fyviv02?context=1).

A benefit that is not covered by that comment is about tax enforcement. Basically it's much more difficult for the wealthy to avoid taxes if the tax code is simplified. Some economists argue that you need to have a ton of different ""tax gateways"" to prevent the wealthy from slipping through the cracks of the tax code. I find this argument uncompelling. It's much easier for the IRS to be lazer focused on enforcing taxes on a small number of cash flow sources rather than trying to tax income at a bunch of disparate points. The benefits will be nontrivial because of chronic underfunding. If you can afford accountants to navigate the complex tax system, then you'll end up avoiding paying some of the taxes that normal people will pay."
"Before the 2008 housing market crash, did some economists and banks really think that the bubble won't burst?","Housing prices have been increasing for a long time, even if you adjust for inflation. This is true not just in the US, but in most of the developed countries. Here is a time series of a house-price index in the US https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA

There are many contributing factors. I will name a few. 

- Population keeps growing but the amount of land stays the same. Although there are other important factors in the short run (such as income and interest rates), population dynamics play an important role. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.4.1172
- Technological progress can help build taller and cheaper apartment buildings, but it cannot help us build more detached homes with big yards in zone-regulated suburbia. Zoning laws greatly restricts the housing supply https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282805774669961 a counter argument to this is that high speed rails and remote working might reduce the importance of living close to your workplace. 
- Globalization and the development of countries that used to be poorer has increased the demand for housing in North America and Europe. This is both coming from people who buy property for personal use, and for international investors that are happy to hold vacant property as a form of investment. 
- Some people use their residence as their primary form
investment. Which makes sense given that the capital gains on your residence are usually tax free or have tax advantages https://uctpmcg.github.io/WebsiteData/OldAgeSavingsandHousePriceShocks_McGee2021.pdf

In fact, if you look at the graph I posted, housing prices are increasing at a faster rate right now than they were right before the 2008 crisis. The low interest rates and high construction costs during the pandemic have greatly contributed. Do you think we are in a bubble right now? 

Even if you believe you are in a bubble, it is difficult to predict whether it will pop soon or not. Do you think housing prices will collapse soon when the interest rates raise again and the supply chain issues go away? These things are always difficult to predict. 

After losing a lot of money trying to ride a financial bubble Isaac Newton famously said “I can predict the motions of the heavenly bodies but not the madness of people”. 

Interestingly, even the popping of soap bubbles war very difficult to predict until recently https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1230623?"

"Why is South Korea’s unemployment rate so low when they have almost 4 times more robots than the US for every 10,000 employee?","Robots do not always kill jobs. In general, they can be complementary or competitive to labour as a production input. Robots and automation increase productivity - meaning more can be produced with no change in the supply of labour. If demand is constant, this can result in lower prices (and loss of jobs if technology is sufficiently labour-replacing). If demand is increasing, higher productivity and higher demand for labour are both possible.

In global markets, the extra production can be exported and bring profits/wealth into the country. Being the most productive means being able to produce more than others with fewer inputs - meaning profits can be achieved at lower prices. As Rob already pointed out, there is no reason to think that technology has a negative effect on labour demand in the long run. It can create short-term issues in particular industries or sectors, but at a national level, robotic density says more about the technological state of society than it does about employment."

How long can Russia keep their stock exchange closed?,"So long as the exchange itself desires to stay closed, potentially forever. The longest closure I can think of was the NYSE which shut for 4 months at the start of the Great War in Europe.

Ultimately, nothing can *force* the exchange open so long as the laws of Russia allow it to remain shut or the institutions there do not actively try to open them regardless of the law.

In terms of issues, the Russian stock market loses a huge amount of liquidity. Confidence in business steadily drops because now issuing shares (and thus a huge source of funding) is far more difficult, and the security provided from having easy and rapid access to sales for investors in the secondary market means they are much more worried about the safety of their money. It also means anyone relying on the price of assets listed in the exchange is not able to get new information. This informations is effectively frozen to when the exchange was last open."

Can we discuss what's up with GME? -65% down since Nov.21; 52week ATL; 7:1 buy-sell ratio (on some brokers); no news; DRS increase. What the heck is happening?😕,"This is literally the only way it could happen. As the great Fredrick Douglass said, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will ."" The oligarchy that controls the financial systems of the U.S., and much of the world, have too much to lose to willingly allow a transfer of wealth on this scale. So they kick the can as far as it will go, they lean on every corrupt politician and bureauocrat they have in pocket, they pull every lever of power they own in media and government, but none of this changes the immutable fact: shorts must close. Whether it happens today or in ten years, it will create generational change for those who HEDL and their families and eventually for the world itself - as apes have a unique goal, different from any other financial player in the history of the humankind: to make the world a better place 🌎. tL;DR: Buy, DRS, HODL, MOASS"
"What would it take for you to say, ""yep, value investing is dead.""","...long sigh, cracks knuckles, cracks neck, stretches and cracks entire back.....here goes......

For value investing to ""work"" we are simply buying good businesses for a good price. More specifically, we are not overpaying to buy good businesses. 

What you are describing, the total disregard by market participants to business fundamentals such as strong balance sheets, good profit margins, positive cash flows, etc. is not what will kill value investing, it's what makes value investing most needed!

The question is what *you* think value investing is? You seem to think that it's all about getting rich, to which I respond with ""sure"" but it's much more than that. It's about securing financial wellbeing without taking on unwanted, unneeded, unrealized risks. Graham himself says that investors should be looking to make good returns with less risk. He wasn't about getting rich quick. It's over many years that this adds up. Value investing is about risk management. With good risk management the good returns will come *because* of the good risk management.

 When ""apes go strong"" and millions pour their money into a stock, that's when the market is being irrational, which is a value investor's dream come true. 

Yes, I get what you are worried about. ""what if the market never realizes you have such a good stock and the price doesn't end up appreciating to it's real value?""

Answer: you get to keep buying a stock of a good company at a very good price. If the company continues to execute well, you will either get dividends, or they will use their excess cash to buyback stocks (remember, they are a good company who presumably understands stock buybacks at low prices add value to existing shareholders while allowing others who need the cash to exit), or they will invest in more investments that will allow them to keep growing. 

If anything, value could potentially stop working if everyone stops buying fads and starts doing serious due diligence based on fundamentals. This is discussed by Graham and you can refer to him as to why this isn't an issue."
Don't economic depressions also cost lives? So doesn't that mean we're actually trying to find a proper balance between disease prevention and economic contraction that does the least damage overall?,"Economists do take this into account, because people make trade-offs with safety all the time. There are different ways to calculate, but mostly, it comes down to how much people are willing to spend to reduce the odds of them dying by some percentage; so if a new regulation is expected to save a life but cost $100 million, it probably wont pass. If it costs a million, it will. This isn't the literal value of a human life. If a baby is down a well, they'll be saved regardless of the cost.

However, by any reasonable estimate of the statistical value of human life, social distancing is a good [investment](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26867) as left unchecked, Covid-19 is very likely to overwhelm the health care sector and keep vulnerable people out of the workforce. The proportion of people who are vulnerable increases with infections, because there are only so many resources, namely ventilators, available. 

A lot of people are claiming there's a trade-off between growth and letting large numbers of people die. The vast majority of leading economists [dispute that we are facing this trade-off right now](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis/). Indeed,  when social distancing was used with the 1918 Pandemic, areas that used distancing less had higher mortality rates *and* [took longer for their economies to recover](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3561560)."

How to do basic Due Diligence (DD) - a Discussion,"I trade on sectors:
I start by looking at macroeconomic factors to determine a position on a sector that I want to invest in. For instance recently there is a push to electric vehicles, home battery power, off grid etc. the looking at a combination of what goes into that sector that is required and will likely see a boom: I.e. lithium (also flavour of the month here but I still see fundamental above-average growth) then choosing fundamentally sound companies in that sector that compliment each other. 
At the same time, looking at sectors I don’t want to be a part of: I.e. banking gets riskier as the property bubble continues to inflate (think 08 GFC, or Irish property bubble), so I stay away from that sector or anything that feeds that sector. 

I continue to track sectors for changes in opinion, like mining companies and general exporters to China, and watching the sentiment regarding china’s import bans, if this looks like it will lift then jump in for the mini rocket."

What are the most contested and cutting-edge questions in economics today?,"There are 6 most major economic puzzles that Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) identify:

Equity premium puzzle: Why is there such a big difference between stock market returns and bond market returns even after adjusting for risk?

Trade home bias: Why is intra-country trade 10x larger than inter-country trade even after adjusting for all the costs associated with trade?

Equity home bias: In an era of unprecedented capital mobility and information, why do individual and institutional investors still tend to invest in companies in their home country?

BKK Consumption Correlation puzzle: In an era of open trade, changes in output can be meaningfully different between countries due to certain shocks, but changes in consumption should not be since you can smooth out lower output in your own country by buying from others. Instead, we find the opposite that consumption is much less correlated than output.

Feldstein-Horioka puzzle: Why do countries with nearly perfect capital mobility between them (e.g. Western Europe and the USA) still have very different returns to investment?

Purchasing power puzzle: Why are real exchange rates so volatile, and why are the new prices so persistent? (There are some good explanations for the volatility, particularly Dornbusch's overshooting model; but not for the persistence together with the volatility)"
How do you all feel about tipping?,"I grew up in a country where nobody tips as a matter of course (tips can be left, but they're completely discretionary, not expected.)

So moving to the US was definitely a culture shock, since tips here consists of a ""baseline tip"" (the ""If you can't afford to tip here you can't afford to be here"" portion) and a ""merit tip"" that can be added on top of the baseline tip which is what other countries would actually treat as the entire tip.

It's toxic in several ways, but here are just two that annoy me:

Because it's an expected part of the compensation, employers consistently underpay their workers to pocket the difference themselves. The minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13/hr, which enshrines that dishonest business practice into law.  
Since employers don't pay a living wage to tipped workers and workers have to rely on tips to survive, tippers don't just reward workers, but can also punish workers by withholding their baseline tip, a concept completely absent in other countries.  

That last part is why it's problematic to not tip at least the baseline tip. Yes the system is bad, but not tipping that baseline tip only punishes the workers that already have no power over that system."

How do you respond when people say being a landlord is unethical?,"Home ownership is not for everyone.  One of my tenants is a loan mortgage officer and a pregnant wife who's a real estate agent.  They have plenty of money in the savings and good credit but they insist on renting instead of buying.  They rent a nice typical middle class house with 4 bedrooms from me.  The arrangement works great between me and them.

Another tenant is a paramedic husband and nurse wife with a kid.  They rent a 3 bedroom house from me that's in a middle class neighborhood.  Again, they make plenty of money and have good credit but they have no intention of ever buying a house.  They've been with me for over 3 years.

I have several dozen properties, most of them multi-family units.  About 60% of them were in such bad shape they were a couple months from being demolished when I bought them.  I put real money, time, and effort into saving those places.  Several times already, I've had people in the neighborhood come to me and thanked me for fixing up the big eyesore in the neighborhood.  

I'm not claiming to be mother teressa.  My motive is strictly for profit.  That said, my business is anything but exploitative.  I provide jobs to tradesmen work on my places.  I provide living spaces to people.  Especially since we are in the middle of a housing shortage crisis, I would classify my business as community building.

Most people just let their properties go to shit.  It's people like me who buy these dilapidated buildings and turn them back into real homes for people to live in.  

These people who accuse me of being evil.  I always ask them when was the last time they went around and fixed up dilapidated houses so that there are more living spaces for people to live in?  Until I get a ""yes"" answer, I'm going to continue to think my business does great community service."

Netflix has no MOAT anymore?,"I cover the industry for a living. Netflix's churn rate is far better than every other service (around 2% a month).

You think empty nesters are gonna keep Disney+? That service has a built-in plateau of families and the birth rate in the U.S. is dropping. Even if Hulu gets incorporated once Disney can reclaim its share from NBCU, the adult content is significantly lacking. 

Peacock is a joke. Paramount+ is showing life, but they're years behind. HBO Max is great, but they are very slow to release new content and who knows what happens when the Discovery boss takes over? Apple TV+ has excellent stuff, but it's too slow to drop new content. Prime Video has blockbusters alongside unwatchable zero-budget trash and its UI is a nightmare. 

Netflix doesn't have to worry about filling a broadcast slate or dealing with theatrical windows. It may not have the IP of some others, but how much longer are we going to ride superheroes and Star Wars? Those fans have already signed up to the services that have them. 

Netflix moves the needle like no one else. Squid Game and Tiger King cost next to nothing. They have a firehose of content and stuff for every demo. 

I'll grant that other services do movies better, but that's because most have theatrical runs with A-list talent in front of and behind the camera. Netflix is getting better at feature-length films. 

It's not the moat it once was, but it's still there. Investors know what they signed up for. Compare that to AT&amp;T shareholders, who may not care about HBO Max or ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) shareholders who threw up when they heard how much would be spent on streaming programming.

Why is geopolitics never mentioned when discussing wage stagnation? Maybe baby boomers had it better because the rest of the world (which was bombed to rubble) just couldn't compete with America?,"Countries don't compete. Firms within an industry compete with each other but countries don't. The classic example from trade policy is steel: a tariff on steel helps domestic steel producers but makes steel users, like cars, less competitive on world markets. Poorer trading partners mean your inputs are more expensive and your export markets smaller than otherwise, reducing returns to scale and thus your own prosperity.

Firstly, the US economy is now [generally agreed to have grown strongly in the 1920s](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-u-s-economy-in-the-1920s/) - this used to be controversial as ""the liquidationist"" hypothesis was an explanation for the Great Depression that turned on the 1920s economy having been one of speculative excess. This was of course before any WWII devastation. 

Secondly, the post war reconstruction was very fast in West Germany, Japan and ~~Italy~~, back to pre-war levels  in the ~~early~~ [mid] 1950s and then growing from there. France and the UK weren't as devastated by the war in the first place.

Vox columnist says going vegan won't stop climate change because economics. Is he right?,"It is right in the sense that you will not reduce emissions by the full amount associated with your previous consumption. It is wrong to the extent that he insinuates that you will not reduce emissions at all.

If you reduce your meat consumption by some amount it is true that there will be some epsilon change in the price of meat that would induce those who were not previously eating meat to enter the market. They will not fully offset all of your consumption because as they eat more we have movement along the supply curve again which bids up the price of meat. In order for your veganism to have no effect that would require the quantity of meat consumption to remain unchanged which means price has been bid up to its old level. If someone was willing to buy that last unit at the original price, they would have done so previously.

Thats not to say that these effects don't exist. Theres a nice theory paper called buy coal by Harstad that suggests govs interested in reducing emissions should buy coal in foreign markets to prevent it from being burned. By owning the coal reserves they prevent the price response on the supply side.

In general I think Yglesias misses another key point which is that there are important peer effects and learning by doing. Beyond burgers and impossible burgers are pretty good and could offset marginal meat consumption in the future. They were developed and will eventually become price competitive because early adopters were willing to pay to subsidize the companies R&amp;D."

What are the economic reasons that caused China to rise but other similarly sized Asian nations like India to stay mostly the same?,"for india specifically you can check this [oecd paper](http://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/46866991.pdf) &amp; references therein. Main constraints seems to be institutional like employment protection regulation which requires any firm with over 100 employees seek govt permission for layoffs this (a) prevents intersectoral labor reallocation (b) prevents firm expansion &amp; exit. There are also other distortions like 

(1) 80% of the employment is in mico enterprises of &lt;10 people - these super small firms cannot increase mfg productivity.

(2) high capital intensity in mfg firms even when unit labor costs are lower than capital costs. This prevents large labor absorption into mfg sector and hence a Lewis style structural transformation. 

(3) almost no labor mobility among rural &amp; urban workers possibly due to EPL regulation (also studies indicate loosening EPL regulation results in larger productivity gains at a state level). lower mobility also reduces the speed of poverty reduction since workers cannot move from shrinking sectors into expanding ones.

(4) high number of state owned firms which are grossly mismanaged &amp; even partial privatization leads to efficiency gains.

(5) in absence of formal welfare state / social insurance mechanism poor people rely on [caste based social insurance system ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w14850)which further lowers labor mobility because by moving to a different area you loose caste based social insurance.

(6) in the pre reform period capital intensive industries were given massive state support and post reform capital intensive industries persist (there is no single paper showing this but a [comprehensive review of the existing evidence](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.49.4.1152) points in this direction)

I paid $1000 for an Adam Khoo investing course so you don't have to! (Summarized in post),"Thanks for posting this. It doesn't surprise me at all, tbh. Most of the posters selling videos are making the money off of people who lack the confidence to invest themselves.

I am no longer picking stocks. It's ETFs for me.,"I decided the same nearly 15 years ago - no regrets. 

Something like 90% of your return/risk exposure is based on asset allocation, and 10% on security selection. And most research indicates that most of that 10% can be efficiently captured using diversified factor exposure rather than trying to make discretionary stock picks. 

Picking individual stocks felt like a lot of effort with the outcome dominated by the market and idiosyncratic risk. 

I still enjoy understanding investing research, but my investment strategies focus on asset and risk factor allocation."

Why is America so hesitant to cut Russia off from the SWIFT banking system?,"The economist Thomas Piketty is arguing against cutting Russia from the SWIFT system ([in French](https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2022/02/12/thomas-piketty-pour-gagner-la-bataille-politique-et-morale-face-aux-autocraties-il-faut-sanctionner-les-oligarques-pas-les-peuples_6113348_3232.html)) due to the regressive effects of the measure, which would affect less the oligarchs (including Putin) and more the poorer Russian people. Here is the (translated) relevant part:

&gt;The problem is that such a measure is very poorly targeted.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just as with conventional trade sanctions, which after the 2014 crisis were largely instrumentalized by the powers that be to strengthen their grip, the risk would be to impose considerable costs on ordinary Russian and Western companies, with adverse consequences for the employees concerned.  
&gt;  
&gt;The measure would also affect a large number of binationals and mixed couples, while sparing the wealthiest (who would use alternative financial intermediaries)."
I recently had an epiphany about how little a million dollars is today compared to what I thought when I was growing up.,"Flip side: Is it as much as it used to be? No, but it’s still a lot. It’s all on a scale. Having a million dollars still puts you on top of 98% of people on the planet, give or take. 

I’m sure a bunch of people here have met nine and ten figure net worth individuals before. In my experience, a number of them somehow don’t think it’s “enough”."
"Would you invest a $120,000 inheritance right now or wait?","DCA a set % over a set period of time, and dump  everything left if something happens where it’s a no brainer (a La March 2020, 08, etc) 

Time in the market beats timing the market every time long term, But sometimes we can get lucky and do a bit of both."
"Given historic market returns of 6%, why on earth would I invest in RE?","This question gets asked all the time, so just a quick summary.

1.) The ability to secure 5x (more if you're willing to live there for a year) leverage on an asset that's not likely to sting you for doing so.

2.) Depreciation - usually your cash flow is largely untaxed.

3.) Amortization - in addition to your cash flow, your mortgage is being paid off each month

4.) Appreciation - not the main appeal for me, just assume it will follow inflation (this year was a nice bonus, though)

A super-simplified example of a deal I would take is something like $30,000 cash to close and $200 in cash flow per month. 8% returns, not bad... but everyone forgets the amortization. As I pay off the mortgage each month, I'm also gaining equity. On a $140,000 house, you're looking at about another $200 per month of principal pay down. Now we're looking at 16% ROI. And it's usually untaxed.

Real estate investing is way more work than the stock market. Nobody would do it (I certainly wouldn't) if the returns weren't better."

Is a military career a good option if you have nothing to lose?,"I was in your shoes once, about 12 years ago. Dropped out of college, it wasn't really for me, although I had high SAT scores and generally did well in my HS classes. I just wasn't interested in a liberal arts education. I was working in a restaurant for $9/hr part time and going nowhere, so I enlisted into the Army.

&amp;#x200B;

If I could give you some advice: do a short-term contract for your initial enlistment, that way if you don't like it, you can get out relatively quickly. I did a 3 year enlistment, but I think you can still do 2 year contracts in some branches. Also, get in shape beforehand, it will save you some headache once you get to BCT or whatever. Running, pushups, situps, and try to hike a few times with a 35 lb pack at a 4 MPH pace for at least 6-8 miles (up to 15 if you can do it). If you can do those things, your initial training will be so much easier. Don't let them trick you into picking a job you don't want (you'll be miserable) or signing up for a longer contract by enticing you with a bigger enlistment bonus. Here's the kicker with enlistment bonuses (unless they've changed recently): You don't get until after you finish training, and if it's over a certain amount, you don't get a lump sum, it gets broken up into your future paychecks over X number of years. Also, go ahead and figure that you'll lose 25% or more to taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional advice: if you choose to enlist, be prepared to hate it for a while. I wasn't good at taking orders, wasn't a people person, needed solitude every once in a while, and was stressed out all the time. After my first year, I started liking it. After two years, I liked it a lot more. You gain some rank, get some experience, and people start treating you better, like you know your stuff. Your paychecks get bigger, you get your head on straight, and things start to come together. It's not a bad gig. Let me know if you have questions. I was active duty Army for 3 years, National Guard for an additional 2, and have a couple buddies who are recruiters now.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Wow, this blew up overnight. Thank you for the gold! I'll try to answer more questions down the thread, but I'm sure there are plenty of others with the same or better insight than me since I was just a lowly short-timer."
To all that are feeling like a failure,"To help anyone on a lower income: I am lucky enough to earn an insane amount, but I was happiest when I was earning around $85k p/a in a government job surrounded by a great group of people.

1000 professional investors asked to pick a number.  The person who is closest to the number which is 2/3 of the average number provided will win.  What number do you choose?  Answer beautifully illustrates the difficulties with the Efficient Market Hypothesis.,"How in earth does one draw the conclusion that this graph ""beautifully illustrates the difficulties with the Efficient Market Hypothesis""?  

Setting aside the question of the validity of the EMH, there's no valuation, no trade-offs, no competition for resources, no demand being met; in short, there's no *market* involved at all.  The author starts off with the (unbacked) premise that a market is nothing but random black-box guessing, and then points out the flaws of such a scheme.

This is not altogether different from when some people try to use a Prisoners' Dilemma to demonstrate some theoretical ""market failure"" all the while ignoring the fact that they've placed an artificial condition on the parties, namely that they can't communicate with each other.

The OP is making one gigantic *non sequitur*."
Today is a dark day for traders,"This should scare all investors. These brokerage firms have just as much control over the market as social media does when choosing who to allow to post on their site. Not many people even knew they could legally stop a stock from being traded. This should cause fear and outrage for any investor, even if they don’t support the GME movement. What if one day they chose to remove the sell option when your position is tanking? This is so much bigger than GameStop, Blackberry, or any other stock banned today."
"In most cases, it will cost your employer far more to replace you than it would to give you a raise. So ask firmly.","Fair warning: my wife was being *severely* underpaid for her sector and expertise, and after repeatedly making a well-documented case for why she should get a healthy raise, she was basically pushed out of her old position. They knew how valuable she was—she was ten times more productive and five times better than the next best person they had—but something about either the management or the payroll/finance/HR just refused to compensate her appropriately.

ON THE OTHER HAND, she immediately got a job at twice the salary, twice the bonus, much more recognition, and a company culture she likes infinitely better.

Your mileage may vary. Being insistent is kind of a crap shoot, so hope for the best, but do be prepared for the worst."
Wealthsimple Investment - 1 year recap,"A lot of weird comments here. This has nothing to do with Wealthsimple vs manual investing. If your portfolio is diversified, then you are likely investing in the same things Wealthsimple is. The problem here is the allocation. OP has an allocation meant for someone who is getting close to retirement, not someone young trying to grow their holdings. OP, you need to jack up your risk level if you're young and want to focus on growth.

I'm seeing a lot of comments from people patting themselves on the back for stock picking. As the saying goes ""everyone's a genius in a bull market"". Stock picking isn't a bad thing, but I haven't seen anyone mention the associated risks and downsides. The returns you've seen over the last year will not continue indefinitely, and when the market turns you will see comparatively large losses vs a diversified portfolio."

Wish I would have known about this group a month ago.,"May I suggest having mad money with which to play? As long as it is a small minority of your cash, you won’t be broken but you can scratch that itch and be prior-constrained by your pre-set rules (ie cash set aside for mad plays). 

I’m a value-dividend investor, with strict rules, so have limited opportunities to invest, but easily 75% of my invested cash went into that portfolio. About 20% went into pure value plays (because they were great opportunities that didn’t meet my div requirements), while less than 5% was set aside for mad investments. 

While $TSLA was the exception, all of my other mad investments were disappointments (3D printing, small med company, search engine startup, etc), reinforcing my faith in my primary investment rules."
"Apparently McDonalds pays 2-3x in Denmark what they do in the US, but prices are only slightly higher. How does the math work for it to still be worth running a franchise?","The numbers are misleading. The piece shows pay after accounting for benefits for Denmark and then shows federal minimum wage in America. 

Minimum wage in Denmark is nominally about 16.60. Adjusted for cost of living that’s 13.83. From there they add various benefits including it appears government provided benefits. 

In the US the average wage of the same worker is paid $9.08 an hour. This is still less but not so dramatically less. 

But yes, there are reforms that could be made to increase wages in the US at limited cost to the average American and ways to reduce cost of living. But the comparison isn’t quite correct here."
"My thoughts on the current Bitcoin value, would like to hear other people thoughts.","First of all, it's okay to have your view. Just because others are investing in bitcoin (or crypto) doesn't mean you have to or are missing out. Although, I'd hope that the institutional adoption in the recent year has prevented you from turning your nose up at the idea.

Let's compare bitcoin to gold. What's the value in gold? Can you make things out of it? Do you mine it out of the ground or rivers and it leads to environmental destruction and slave labour? Does it boost economies world-wide due to some kind of generated demand? Bitcoin is compared to gold due its nature as a store of value. This is the main reason why companies say they have invested in it. If bitcoin is mined with renewable energy, isn't is actually less impactful on the environment than gold?

As for the energy issue in bitcoin mining, yes it's an issue. It could wreak havoc on China's future plans to reduce their emissions/ meet this target of blah blah. Yes, it's an issue. Kevin O'Leary recently suggested on twitter ""I am only buying green bitcoin""... Now, green bitcoin is mined using renewable sources, and there are plenty of crypto-mining companies that are growing and whom are only using renewable sources to power their mining rigs. However once bitcoin has been traded, there is no way to distinguish in how that specific bitcoin was mined (i think!). But of course, generally people only hear about these 'power more than argentina / italy blah blah' headlines. However the sector for green crypto currencies IS growing, just quietly...

The entire point of bitcoin is that no governments have control of it. It is essentially a currency that governments can't mess up themselves. This is the point. It's a hedge against the lira, the peso, even the US dollar (although the FED's Powell will prevent this actually following through). This is a reason why you may have seen its emergence in rogue countries. If a country's currency crashes then don't worry, your 2 bitcoins are worth $120,000 right now, and you haven't lost your entire net worth... But there's a threat that governments may outlaw cryptocurrency such as India. This is a whole different story; Recently there's been reports of 'If you want to ban bitcoin, then you'll have to ban the internet', lol. So we'll see how that progresses.
 My point here is that if a government controls it, then why would people want it? Why would people buy it? It would miss the point... The governments may as well put that time and effort into strengthening their own currency.

Overview of bitcoin versus 'altcoins': Every crypto exchange like Coinbase or Binance HAS to offer any cryptocurrency in relation to bitcoin. So if you want to purchase ethereum then you will see a ethereum/BTC cost. That doesn't mean other crypto currencies can't grow faster than bitcoin but this is typically why the price of bitcoin affects EVERY other crypto (putting aside the fact that generally the word 'bitcoin' can be used to refer to crypto currencies).

Okay, I've tried to put this in simple english that doesn't make me sound completely biased and tried to get across a few different points. This is not investment advice etc, and good luck!"
"Are there any old theoretical concepts of economics academically falsified in recent years? In other words, what changed in economic theory last 20 years or so?","Microfinance. In the 90's and early-mid 2000s it was all the rage and many saw it as a panacea that was going to lift the poorest of the poor out of poverty. If only people had access to credit, they could invest in their businesses and pull themselves up. The problem was that poor people have no collateral, so there's no way to make sure they pay the loans back. So some microfinance pioneers like Mohammad Yunus (Nobel prize winner) came up with the idea of using social capital as collateral. By giving loans to many people in the same village, and making additional loans contingent on everyone paying back the initial loan, social pressures will make sure the loans get repaid. After all, nobody wants to be a social pariah and the reason their neighbor can't get additional loans for the business. They also gave the loans specifically to the women of the village, because data shows that women are a lot more likely to invest the money in their family, rather than just consume it, and [much more likely to repay the loans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X10002330?casa_token=TbShxsgnrjgAAAAA:Cu4SvsRGc5sr8j-MbBT1vPpH4It2xCKpw7BR-oAZR4V7wP_X9oDAOQox-MwtZST8BrBJ5isykrg).

Turns out it doesn't always work so great. Access to credit leads people to take risks that they wouldn't ordinarily do so, and perhaps aren't well suited for. Businesses are started by people that cannot manage them or do not have the tools to be successful. When they go bankrupt and cannot repay the loans, the entire village is punished, which has obvious social implications.  [The UK government funded a synthesis study in 2010](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Portals/0/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries/MICROFINANCE_WEB%2019March11.pdf?ver=2011-03-25-130509-613) that details a lot of the problems that were unforeseen. 

This is not to say that microfinance is all bad. It simply isn't a panacea and must be implemented very carefully. Access to credit and the banking system is really critical for giving poor households the ability to save money, manage economic or other shocks, and get loans needed to start businesses."

What is going on with VZ?,"VZ is a stock that that trades like a bond. It's 10 year price channel has a average growth rate of 4% a year, so considering the dividend return it is pretty average market perform (although severely underperformed in the past two years). I have \~8% of my portfolio in VZ, it does not generate any alpha but it is a good stable anchor from its ultra low volatility.

Regarding your comment, VZ is a *value stock*. It is cheap relative to what it offers in terms of PE/EBITA/cashflow, because the company is mature and in a stagnation. If you scroll back on the chart to 1999, you will see that VZ was trading at an ATH of 64$ (which it has never broken). Back then this was a *growth stock*, was reporting crap PE/EBITA/cashflow but those numbers were increasing by high double digits every year. There is a place in your portfolio for both but the latter has to be traded.

Now is a great time to be accumulating VZ since the stock price is depressed because of the massive amount of debt they have accumulated from their 5G buildout. Right now it is trading very close to its 300 MA, and from a technical standpoint near strong support (touching previous highs from 2013 and 2014). **For dividends you care about building out future cash flow which means you need more shares. If the dividend is safe and the company is performing, then you want the stock to go down since you can use this opportunity to accumulate more shares for cheaper.**"

Why does USA not pay off its debt ?,"The problem is that you can only do this once. Money supply is around [20T$](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), and federal debt is around [29T$](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN). As debt is issued in dollar, and not in, lets say, Euro, the US could indeed print 29T$ and pay all their debts. There are two problems with that. First, if you ever want to borrow money again afterwards, people are going to demand a very high interest rate and repayment in different currencies. So you can get out, but only once. Second, in the short term, it would still destroy the value of the dollar, meaning that the buying power of US citizens would drop. This would also make the US more competitive, boosting exports, but in the short-run it will mostly likely solely have negative consequences."
Remember,"My $0.02: it is imperative that real retail investors know that they’re ‘buying’ and ‘selling’ shares that are not necessarily deposited into their accounts. Unscrupulous brokers can just take their money and add ‘1’ to their balance to convince them that they were just credited a share. If the user sells at a loss, the broker just hands the sale amount, debits the share from the user’s account and pockets the difference. If the sale is for a profit, the broker just shrugs and gives the money over. Plenty of other people will sell at a loss anyway. 

This is why we suspect that brokers like RobinHood shut off the ‘Buy’ button in Jan 2021, when the price of GME started skyrocketing. They didn‘t hold the shares, and would have been on the hook for actually paying out of pocket. 

And the best way to counteract that is to Direct Register all GME shares, using GameStop’s Transfer Agent, ComputerShare. You might have seen all the purple circles on this subreddit. That is all retail investors buying shares via ComputerShare, or transferring shares from other brokers like Fidelity. We’re also tallying it all up using our DRSBot. 

Even GameStop has started announcing the DRS’ed shares during their quarterly filings. So far, we have locked up about 9 million shares, a significant portion of GameStop’s micro cap. 

This results in real shares drying up in the market, and corrupt short hedge funds are resorting to more and more naked shorting to keep the price of GME suppressed. There are some times when the price starts to rush up, but it‘s always beaten down by the bad faith actors. And this corruption is entirely evident to anyone capable of a little technical analysis. As quite some folks on here are. 

The SEC is either corrupt and useless, or incompetent and therefore useless. GameStop can‘t even ask us shareholders to DRS our shares because the SEC might declare that market manipulation. 

What we need to do is to keep DRS’ing, and spread the word out to as much people as possible so they can protect themselves. The bad actors have the full might of CNBC &amp; Jim Cramer and other bought &amp; paid for financial outlets. We have just our voices. 
And that is why I just gave this essay to someone who really doesn’t need to be taught what DRS is. 

We would love it if you could use your reach and voice to try to educate folks NOT on Reddit to DRS their shares. And not just for GameStop. There are quite a lot of shorted companies out there. If those shares become unavailable too, the bad faith hedge funds and banks reducing America and the world to a slavish hell hole will run out of ammo and steam fast. 

Also, I read somewhere that you’re friends with the YouTuber Mr. Beast. If you both were willing, introducing this subreddit to his channel might spread the word super fast. There are quite a lot of highly educated, intelligent and knowledgeable folks (Dave Lauer,  Dr. Susan Trimbath, Jon Stewart himself, to name just a few) who have educated us and been educated too. We are always willing to teach new users, although bad faith actors embedded within this sub sometimes try to make that difficult. 

You entering our sub is a rare opportunity for exposure we have been struggling to get. Please, take all the time you need to ask questions, understand the depth to which the rot in the US markets goes, and always feel free to ask the community questions. But when you’re ready, if you’re ready, please help us spread the word in any way you or your friends can.

"I am a senior in high school. I am from a low income family, and desire to move out of my income bracket but feel like I don’t know anything about saving money","I grew up poor and learned some lessons and one of them being it’s not that complicated. Slow yes, but not complicated. 1. Get a job. Any job and keep on looking while working on another job that pays more. 2. Not everyone is meant to go to college and that is ok. My most baller friends work in plumbing and hvac. 3. Live cheaply. If you can handle parents do it and help out and be great full your not paying market rents. If not, get lots of roommates. Don’t have kids for a long long time. Buy a certified used car, never new. 4. Save an emergency fund 3-6 months of full expenses. 5. Don’t tell anyone you have money . NO ONE. 6. Never loan money to anyone. 7. After you have saved emergency fund, start a Roth and try to max it out. 8. After you max Roth, take as much as you can comfortable afford and invest in vanguard funds. You can sign up on vanguard or fidelity. In the meantime, try to eat well, sleep, gym, and continue trying to make more money and learn a trade or get a practical major. Nurse, accountant, engineer, etc… I always felt like a poor person like myself didn’t have the luxury of getting and art degree. Also, try to surround yourself with smart people. Seek a successful mentor. Lots of stuff but not complicated."
It is ok to just rent. You're not a failure.,Never felt like a failure for renting but knowing a complete stranger has the keys to my place and the caveat to let themselves or any tradies they see fit into my home whether I’m there or not really grinds my gears. And don’t even get me started on the 3 monthly inspections where my personal possessions get photographed and sent on to the owner for them to view. Feels like a complete invasion of my privacy. Hate renting!
Volkswagen Joins Tesla in Calling on India to Lower EV Import Duties,"Unpopular Opinion, but I think we should wait a bit in lowering import duties on EV. Not much, maybe 2yrs?

Here is my argument(feel free to disagree and point out flaws, I welcome it)

1. India is in a very nascent stage of EV adoption, we should first finalise on our EV standards. Testing Standards, Charging Standards, Power Delivery Standards. US is facing challenges due to different plugs by different manufacturers, whereas in the EU, they have a standard, and manufacturers have to comply or provide adapters.
2. Wider accessibility of charging stations is a must, now with the right standards, we should have higher availability of these as well, across the country. If there aren't enough charging points, people will not buy EV, without mass adoption, International players may not see the sales they hope, and might just walk out of the country. It is an egg-chicken problem, but the Govt. should start putting a few charging points in cities at least (primary target for EV vehicles).
3. Indian manufacturers like Tata, Mahindra, Hero, Ola are doing amazing work in the EV sector. Moreover, startups are working in this space to better battery tech, power delivery, availability and cost reduction. They should be given some time to flourish, make errors, learn and course correct. If Tesla, VW, and others enter the market, so will their money. It will kill all these startups and innovation Indian manufacturers are working on.

It would be amazing to have a flourishing EV ecosystem, but I would also like to see India take the lead in the same. In the next 2-3yrs, we will see EV options across segments (scooters, bikes, super bikes, cars), and with more competition, the cost will come down as well.

If we play our cards right, if we let our homegrown brands to get bigger, it could be a game changer for us. I am all for Tesla and VW and others to come to Indian markets with their EV offerings, but with tough competition from Indian manufacturers and a standardised efficient EV ecosystem, it will be a boon for Indian consumers."
I feel like clarification is needed about Today,"I'm down several thousand dollars, and for once I really don't care. If this thing plummets more, too, that's fine.

I had a conversation with myself the other day. My conclusion was that I wouldn't be able to justify to myself why I didn't take a risk to dramatically improve my living situation if the stock does squeeze, and that reckoning would leave me feeling worse than losing what I would say is just disposable income.

That, and having started my adult life just as the financial crisis of 2008 unfolded, which hampered job opportunities in 2012 as well, I am thoroughly enjoying the chance to ever so slightly hit back at financial institutions that repeatedly use reckless and illegal practices to make money."
"16 year old here, i have a lot of time and i want to learn how to make a lot money","Here are 4 things I think you should learn. 

1. There are two categories of people and only 2. There are those who create jobs (business owners) and then there are those who take jobs (employees)

2. Scalability. Example: Plant 1 tomato seed. Now you have 1 tomato tree. Take all of the seeds from the tomatoes on that tomato tree and replant all of those new seeds. Now you have 10 tomato trees. Rinse and repeat Etc. (I know nothing about gardening so take this example lightly)

3. Sacrifice. 

4. Perseverance 

I’ll go over those points a little more. 

1. You will never be truly wealthy if you’re an employee. You can be a high earning programmer, doctor, salesperson etc. But you’ll never truly be wealthy unless you’re the one who own who owns the company. For as long as you have a boss you won’t be rich. You can be well off with a high salary but never wealthy. 

2. Scalability: I’ll tell you a story about a friend of mine from high school. Once he got his diploma he immediately went into a trade school. His profession was plumbing. A lot of people mocked him because he chose a blue collar job while his friends went to pursue degrees at college. He started off by starting his own company. 

At first he had 1 van and just himself. He would travel around the city doing random plumbing jobs. His salary wasn’t great but it wasn’t bad for his age. Once he saved enough money he bought a second van and hired a plumber/employee to run that van. So now he has two vans , himself, and his 1 employee. He can now do twice as many plumbing jobs and his revenue has doubled. Then he bought a third van and hired a third employee to run that van. Now his revenue has tripled. Today he has over 20 vans and 20 full time employees each operating their own van. He has a receptionist who manages all of the jobs and he is partially retired and he is in his 30s. He doesn’t have to grind a 9-5 anymore. All he does it occasionally call to check in and get progress updates. He is still scaling up and growing. For each of his vans he profits almost $25k a year. 20 vans times $25k is $500k a year and he doesn’t have to work anymore. 

3. Sacrifice: this doesn’t always apply to everyone but during my entire 20s (I’m 30 now) I didn’t have much of a social life. I worked like a dog and focused only on my businesses. While my peers went out every weekend to party and had healthy life/work balances I was living a life of obsession and the only thing on my mind was work. By the end of this year or the next year my goal is to be able to have enough staff to run my businesses without much oversight and my yearly income will be close to 7 figures a year while I do whatever I want. Side note: I do not recommend doing this. It was extremely stressful, tiring, frustrating, and almost all of my personal relationships had gone to trash. I have zero relationship with my family and have no friends outside of work. 

4. Perseverance: never give up. I had over 20 failed businesses during my 20s. There were several times where I bet everything I owned on the wrong business and several times I ended up in horrible spots and had to move back home. Take each failure as a lesson and use failure as a learning tool. You can only fail so many times before you hit success."
Was it always inevitable for home prices to outpace wages?,"Urban areas make up less than 2% of land use in the USA and less than 1% in Australia. Land supply itself isn't a problem. The issue is land supply where people want to live.

Even within urban areas, there is usually significant scope to increase housing supply - underutilized land, derelict buildings as well as increasing the density of developments.

The principle constraint on housing supply is actually largely self-inflicted - land use regulation heavily impedes the ability of developers to respond to the market

https://docs.iza.org/dp15447.pdf

I personally view the housing crisis as more of a political rather than an economic one. The economic solution is fairly straight-forward. The problem is the local political resistance to increasing housing supply."

My dad is the sole breadwinner of the family. He is in poor health and might die in a few years. What should my family do?,"Focus on school - do not drop out for any reason.  It's hard to think school is so important when you have an unstable home and food insecurity, but school is your one ticket out of this mess and not having to repeat your parents' mistakes.

Unfortunately a lot of lower income households rely on cheap calories (junk food) to sustain themselves.  But this just perpetuates a cycle of bad health, obesity, and poverty.  Look up food banks and other programs that take fresh (unsold) food and vegetables from farms directly to community distribution centers.  There are tons of simple and easy recipes online to make delicious and nutritious meals."
Megathread: 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Paul Milgrom and Robert B.

How do rich people “hoard wealth?”,"“Hoard” is a politically charged word. This is a difficult question to answer without coming down on one side of a very contentious divide. What people typically mean when they say “hoard” is that rich people are holding lots of their wealth in safe, static assets like cash or Treasury bonds. This money is static because it is subject to certain constraints that prevent it from being used for more productive, but risky endeavors.

&gt;Isn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?

Yes and no. Not all investments are created equal. When people invest, they usually want some mixture of both 1) safety, and 2) a high return. There is generally a trade off and people will have different preferences depending on their risk tolerance. When people hold cash in a checking account, they are letting the bank do the investing. Banks have lots of convoluted rules for how they can manage assets due to the inherent risk of bank runs like 2008. What’s happening now is that banks are also “investing” in cash and T-bonds to a large extent. Note that cash held by banks at the Fed (called Reserves) is ultimately not really invested in anything. It’s there in large part to back up everything else and provide a buffer in the case of a run. Before 2008, banks didn’t used to hold Reserves in excess of their legal requirements, but during the crisis a lot of things changed and suffice it to say that now they are holding (or from some people’s perspective “hoarding”) more than ever. And as for T-bonds, both private banks and the Fed are investing in the U.S. Federal government when they choose to hold Treasuries. But the government isn’t actually spending or investing in a lot relative to the global demand for its debt.

Over the past few decades, and especially in the last 10 years, the amount of money being held in cash and T-bonds has increased substantially. One effect of this can be seen in M2 money velocity. Basically, M2 money is cash and money held in checking accounts, and the velocity of M2 money is a variable that loosely corresponds to how fast M2 money is moving around the economy. Since this value is decreasing, we can infer that more and more money is sitting around in cash, ultimately being backed up by Reserves at the Fed. Theoretically, the people/institutions who own this money could invest it in something else that yields a better return. But they’re not doing that. As to why this is the case—that’s a hotly debated topic. One theory is that it’s the product of rising inequality. The richer you are, the lower your marginal propensity to spend. This is just a fancy way of saying that rich people tend to save money while poor people tend to spend it. There is a *huge* desire for saving in dollars right now that far exceeds the capacity of those dollars to be spent, because poor people don’t have any money (relatively speaking). Another theory is that investors are fighting a losing battle against deflation and demographics. The world population is getting older, and there are fewer and fewer young workers per old retiree with each passing year. This has theoretically decreased the opportunities for robust growth, i.e. there really is no good answer for how all that cash should be put to use. Moreover, old people tend to want safer assets, so they are less eager to put their money in relatively riskier investments.

Note that this is just a one picture of what “hoarding” can mean. In practice it can refer to other ways that rich people make inefficient investments. Buying up lots of expensive art or super yachts might also be seen as ways in which rich people are using their wealth in ways that don’t necessarily lead to as much “trickle down” as supply siders like to claim—i.e. hoarding. Think of the dragon Smaug, who hoarded a mountain of gold on Erebor. Perhaps he was afraid the dwarves were going to use it poorly, such as by starting a war with the elves. He also probably didn’t think the dwarves would pay back any loans he made in the first place, and so he chose to sit on the gold instead—an inefficient but safe choice. In the end, he was killed by the dwarves (technically the kill shot was from a man named Bard, from Laketown) due to his greed and the mountain of gold that was spent by the dwarves who acquired it ushered in a literal Golden Age fueled by productive investments in new infrastructure and the like."

"To all the people who recently bought BB, I have a question for you","I think it's because no one really knew what Blackberry is doing now, so they didn't see it as a worthwhile investment 2 weeks ago.

I bought into BB after the 2nd dump day when it hit $15. I'm pretty excited what they have in store for the future."

Opportunity to cash out $10M plus $5M earnout in fast growing tech company,"I am 53 and still working in tech still trying to get to RE. When I was 30 we had the chance to merge with another company who was in their quiet period, 2 weeks before their IPO. Straight 1:1 stock trade. I was the only one in the room on my side voting yes. CEO and COO both voted no because they thought they could hold out a year or two and 10x the valuation. I missed out on $15M+ that day sitting in a board room on Madison Ave looking out over Central Park. I can picture everything vividly today because I thought at the time, ""These two guys are being greedy and are going to screw my entire life plan, remember how close you got."" And I was right. Dot com bust, etc. etc. The company laid off hundreds and stayed going through it all, to be acquired years later. I eventually made enough from my stock to buy a small compact car.

Should I retire at 30 with $5M (today) or at 40 with $10M (in 10 years)?,"I have taken 2 career stops for 1+ years each at age 25 and 35. I had money but nowhere near what I have now, just the luxury it afforded me FI. So I knew I would need to return to work at some point.

What it did was let me enjoy things in life that can be better appreciated and one when you don’t have life’s responsibilities (kids..) and have health. I zip lined, water rafter, cycled 100 mile days and travelled and enjoyed a different pace of life.

Each time the adventure and break gave me the perspective and chance to SEE and decide the next step that I could not have done staying in the same track and grinding at another job.

I took risks in my careers - some paid off, some didn’t financially, but all paid off in life’s adventures and stories. I make a great dinner party guest with these stories now at age 40+. No company cares if you have 1-2 years break in a resume when you have 10+ years experience and a clear story of value you can add.

So perhaps see it as a career break. You might return, you might not. You might take a new path.

Cineworld to file for bankruptcy,"I'm not surprised to see this happening. 

My local cinema is part of a small regional chain, and over the last year its dramatically reinvented itself in order to become profitable. Its got a full blown bar and restaurant, arcades, dart games, and boutique ten pin bowling. 

I have a membership card with them so I get unlimited free films and a discount on everything else (except the bar and restaurant). I got to see a lot of films, and about 90% of the time the screen is no more than 25% full. They rarely have substantial lines at the drinks and popcorn stand, or to get your ticket checked to get through to the screens. 

However, the restaurant and bar area is frequently quite busy and the arcade/bowling area is often packed nearly full. 

They've also started to pivot away from the blockbuster film model, and are showing a few older films every month, just once or twice each. Last Halloween I went and saw their 20th anniversary showing of the first Harry Potter movie, and that showing was packed full."

What a difference dividends have made in my life.,"If you want the stocks simply for income/cash flow, you might want to look at some covered call etfs. Typically they return 8%+ dividend yield and often payout monthly. Basically, you’re $44k would get you approximately 4K per year, dripped back in you 
get the Buffet compounding effecting monthly. 

Typically, this strategy is used by retirees that need cash flow to live, very safe depending on which you buy.

Cons: less capital appreciation than potentially owning the stock itself, but if your goal is simply cash flow then it could work.

The theory is that stock capital appreciation is never your money until you sell, but if you are holding that stock for dividends... then the whole idea is never actually selling. Therefore, you really only get the much smaller dividend cash flow, but feel richer on paper.

Ex. Buy stock X at $100 with a 3% div, $100,000 = $3,000 per year. Now let’s say stock X goes up to $125 in 5 years, you’ve made $25,000 in capital gains, but you didn’t really because you haven’t sold the stock. Instead you’ve really only gained your $3k per year div (potentially compounded with a drip but let’s imagine it’s just $3k for simplicity). Therefore a total earning of $15k in div and $25k in capital appreciation = $40,000... but only $40k if you sell your shares... will you do that?

People end up feeling richer than they are because the number gets so big, but you never actually get that money until you entirely sell out of the position. Most people actually never sell when their stocks are peaking because of human nature/greed. Typically people end up selling when their capital appreciation goes down basically wasting all of that time holding for only a 3% return per year.

Covered call etfs: basically buy the etf for the monthly dividend and annual div yield of 8%+. Take for instance ZWC (Canada) 8.19%. $100,000 = $8,190 per year. Over 5 years that’s $40,950. That beats the individual stock purchase without having to worry about if you bought a loser.

Pros: you get that money! That money is yours, paid out every month. You can do whatever you want with that, it’s yours irrespective of capital appreciation or depreciation. Obviously, reinvesting those divs monthly would compound quite quickly. Basically, your first year of drip would be over $700 more for next year, rinse repeat and the drip keeps increasing. In 10 years with a drip, you’ve almost doubled your returns, now you’d be bringing in almost $16,000 per year, $1,333 per month. Invested in a tax free account and all of that money is yours.

My perspective: not very much capital appreciation over the years. These etfs are meant for cash flow, not necessarily great capital appreciation returns. So essentially, if you want to beat these funds then you better have an average return of over 8.19%, in this instance, every year, across all of your stocks, for the rest of your life - professional hedge fund managers don’t even return that over 30+ years, we call it reverting to the mean. Most people are bad stock pickers, they get one winner and then have 3 losers. These etfs essentially eliminate that entire stress of picking good stocks or suffering paper hands over losses from picking bad stocks. 8.19% is also on par with s&amp;p500 returns over the past 30 years, in fact a little more... and without all the stress of depreciation.

Cash flow is king!

Disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor, these are my opinions solely. I am not currently employing this method yet but by March I have $300k going into this strategy. Atm, I have a $20,000+ annual div returns account from various stock picking. Like I said above, I’m winning in some and losing in others but an average 5.6% average annual yield on them."

Is it true that rich countries are rich because they exploit developing countries,"Every reply you've gotten so far couldn't resist pigeonholing mercantilism, slavery, imperialism or colonialism into your question so I'll take a swing at this. While developmental economics aren't really part of my wheelhouse, a good kick-off point would be to refer to the [FAQ section on free trade, protectionism and development.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_protectionism_and_development), but I'll !ping DEV just in case.

&gt; While the rich countries wealth grows very fast the poor countries grow at a slow rate since they dont manufacture.

Generally speaking this goes against the idea of convergence - the catch-up effect - based on the [law of diminishing marginal returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) as we know it per the [Solow-Swan model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model#Conditional_convergence). Mind you, the proper institutions and policies need to be in place and there is a lot of literature on the subject of convergence/divergence so there are some caveats to keep in mind, but a quick look at the [growth rate of real GDP per employed person](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/growth-rate-of-real-gdp-per-employed-person) or [GDP growth per capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-growth?time=2012) over the years - as well as a general knowledge of history concerning rapid economical development of poorer countries like the ""Asian Tigers"" or the ""Celtic Tiger"" and various [other similar examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_economy) - should be enough to dispell this idea fairly quickly. Notice in the graphs how growth in the West has remained relatively stable and marginal, while Southeast Asian economies have exploded.

Advanced economies tend to rely on intensive growth through productivity increases much more than developing countries which still have lots of ""easy"" room to grow through extensive growth (= maximizing ones economic inputs like resources and labour and thus aggregate output). One other thing to keep in mind however would be the [Lucas paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_paradox) which begs the question why we do not always see capital flow from rich to poor countries.

&gt; What can these poorer or developing countries do to get richer?

Guarantee stability - ranging from political to judicial etc - and trade."
Why do people not retire?,"The funny thing is this happens all the time in jobs where people don’t make much money too. Any academic setting is riddled with emeritus professors who live for seminars.

Do landlords generate wealth?,"Of course the service of renting out housing creates value.

I mean, just imagine, you're young and moving away for college. You need a place to live. How are you supposed to accomplish that without landlords? Essentially the only options are, you rely on the kindness of strangers to allow you to live somewhere for free, that's not exactly sustainable. Or you buy a house or apartment. You have no real income or savings and you don't even know where you want to live after college. Burdening yourself with a loan is most likely a pretty damn terrible idea.

Obviously there's also the more likely third option y you're simply unable to move and severely limited in the places you can live at all. I mean, what would *you* do without a landlord? 

Landlords neatly solve the problem of providing housing for people who can't or don't want to purchase their own. Ultimately it's that simple.

*How* exactly that happens is a different question. In my country we generally have a strong legal framework where tenants actually have a bit more power than landlords (usually). Any ""shady business"" is so rare that it's not really worth thinking about."

If you're married does your retirement fund need to double?,"It helps to stop thinking of a married couple as two distinct individuals and to start thinking of them as one entity: a household. Our household income is every dollar that comes in, regardless of who earned it. Our household expenses are every dollar that goes out, regardless of who spends it. There’s no “me” or “you” anymore, we became an “us” when we got married. 

The household needs enough of a nest egg to generate enough income to cover the household’s expenses, regardless of whose name is on the accounts. The 4% rule is a common guideline for determining that, so take your annual expenses and multiply by 25 or your monthly expenses and multiply by 300. For example: if you need to spend $5k/month that’s $60k/yr which means you’ll need a $1,500,000 nest egg"
How did Martin Shkreli make 40 million by mismanaging companies?,"Well, I made hundreds of millions by managing my companies extremely well. For instance, I started Retrophin, from scratch with $4 million and it is worth $800 million today.

Is it ALWAYS Capitalism’s Fault?,"It's more about the framework in which Marxist economics operate in.

Under the labor theory of value, well, value comes from labor. And to make a long story short, surplus value is the difference between labor cost and the value created by that labor.

So, value comes from your labor. But *because* surplus value is by definition the difference between the value your labor creates and what you receive in return, extraction of surplus value is *by definition* exploitation.

Which is all fine and dandy in the sense that those are for the most part internally consistent definitions, and you can in principle define things however you want.

The problem is that the entire premise rests on the labor theory of value actually being a valid theory of value. Nowadays science agrees that it is not, so any conclusions that rest on the LTV fall apart with it.

Mainstream economics would tell you that the price of your labor is determined by supply and demand for your labor. That doesn't in of itself mean you are ""fairly"" compensated or that the price of your labor is automatically ""good"" or ""optimal"" in any economic sense, but it also doesn't mean that it's automatically exploitation, either.

That said, there certainly are plenty of scenarios where you can make arguments that wages are not close to what they would be under perfectly competitive markets, [monopsony power in labor markets is a big part of the literature around minimum wage for example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage/)

&gt;Why do all of capitalism’s critics accuse it for things it isn’t responsible for?

Well, at least part of it, for Marxism, is that Marx' writings were always more of a critique of ""capitalism"" rather than offering alternatives. Not to mention that it's often in the political interest of such people. That said, I don't think there's a ""scientific"" answer to that."

I hate my degree,"If you can at all make it through, I'd really suggest finishing the masters. Life is long and you are young. You'll have lots of opportunities ahead to try lots of things, career wise. Those NGOs will still be there in a year or two when you finish the Master's degree. Once you get into working for the NGOs you may find it a bit, uh, disappointing. So I wouldn't suggest leaving the degree behind to just see if you like it.  


If a desk job, doing analysis really is that distasteful to you, and finishing the Master's really is that horrible of a prospect, then you're gonna have to do some soul searching to figure out what it is you do want. But I would say that doing analysis can be interesting and you can discover you do, in fact, care about things that are important but don't quite meet the criteria for saving the whole world all at once.   


I wouldn't at all take a peek at the life in a consulting job as a good representation of what normal working life it like. Those jobs are an insane grind. Most jobs aren't at all like those.

Worst thing to happen to my tenants. One dies days before Christmas... Family is struggling. Searching for advice.,"That's extremely tough.

Hopefully, she has some sort of benefits or insurance in place. How much time do they have left on their lease?"
Recently had a windfall of luck such that my base salary has jumped to 1cr. Collecting ideas from internet on what to do now.,"1. Get ready to pay taxes that will make you cry after seeing how much is deducted, compare that to how much you earned before. 10% surcharge if more than 1 cr.
2. Don't reveal the salary to anyone. Don't go around looking for ca telling you need to file 1 cr income, you will invite trouble. Look for colleagues who already have a ca. 
3. You can deduct expenses if you are a contractor so you could buy an office space and show it as expenses. All expenses need bill for claiming.
4. Don't forget to pay quarterly advance tax else penalty on 234 abc will be big.
5. Esops on date of vesting if company doesn't deduct tax liability is on you. Any remitance from foreign account will show up in form 26 as.
6. Don't jump to real estate immediately wait for a year till your job is stable.
7. Buy health and life term insurance if company doesn't provide one.
8. Stay away from sins ;) easy to get into difficult to exit.
9. PMS is not required if you can manage your money. Difference between investing 10 lakh vs 100 lakh is just a digital zero and nothing much changes in terms of where or how you invest.
10. Avoid jumping into business ideas given by uncles and aunty. Don't buy lic policy.

What happens to the global economy if i burn 1 billion $?,"Current m0 (physical money) dollar supply is 6328 billion, which means you're removing 0.0158% of physical money denominated in dollars. Would argue that this would do nothing because most money isn't cash and its such a small amount. Furthermore a larger amount of dollars get made every year. Now lets just say you remove a significant amount of dollars. Then what would happen? Well you would lose that money. The reserve bank would see that there is a lack of liquidity and do the proper monetary policy to fill the liquidity gap."
Whats wrong with some of you?,"Value investors will tell you to be contrarian and buy beaten down stocks, but then when the time comes it’s all “no no not those ones!”

So..I just learned I have a brain tumor,"As someone who got diagnosed with a life-altering cancer at a relatively young age (late 30s), the best advice I can give you is not to make any immediate huge life decisions in the first few months.  Those first few hours/days/weeks after diagnosis, you start questioning *everything*, your brain just goes into a kind of hyper-emotional survival mode, and if you're a planner like me, you start reassessing just about every aspect of your life plan/situation, because it now looks like things are 180 degrees different from how they were just the day before.

Best advice I wish someone had told me at the time... just breathe, let yourself go through the emotions, but hold off on any major life decisions for at least a few months.  Give your brain time to adjust to the new situation and develop a more solid understanding of what you're actually going to be facing.  Once you've processed everything and emotions aren't running the show quite so much, then you can start reassessing things and figuring out if changes need to be made.

I'm now almost 6 years out from my diagnosis and while I'm not cured, the condition is responding really well to treatment, and my prognosis is for a mostly normal life.  Original life plan is back on track, and no drastic changes were necessary.  (Though in the heat of the moment we made several drastic changes - including downsizing the house and moving to a new town closer to my doctors - which we later regretted.)

Either way, best of luck to you!  For what it's worth, having been through the ringer these last years, modern medicine is a goddamned miracle.  Just find a doctor you trust and let them work their magic, and hopefully your outcome will be as good as mine."

Can someone explain why SE Asia is soooo goddamn cheap?,"Currency strength. Understand that “cheap” is relative. You’re trying to say SEA is cheap for you, an American, or any other country with stronger currency. Ask a working class Thai who earns in THB if they’re comfortable getting USD5 dinner every day, they’ll probably tell you that’s a weekend splurge. The same amount could perhaps buy them 3-4 weeknight meals. I live in the neighbouring country, and a USD5 dinner is a treat I hardly give myself even as someone earning above market rate.

To understand this, I suggest you read up on purchasing power parity and view the FX rate on a local’s perspective. How far does USD5 get you in the US? Say that gives you a happy meal. Then, find out how much a happy meal costs in THB, then compare these 2 amounts as a 1:1 ratio. How many hours of wage give an American and a Thai these amounts in their respective countries?

Remember that USD is not a global currency. What’s a spare change for you could be someone’s daily wage in another part of the world."

I promise you’ll learn to be profitable if you keep with it.  But you have to look at that money lost as education expenses.

What is theta gang?,"Thetagang is any investment strategy that generates returns primarily from theta decay. CSPs/CCs/Wheeling are pretty much the entry level of theta strategy.

I almost never intend to be assigned shares of the underlying I sell options for, unless I sell the option deep ITM with the intent of being assigned when I enter the trade (.70 delta+). 

Only writing options on underlyings you want to, or are willing to be assigned shares of? Why? I write options because I have no interest in holding most individual stocks long. I manage my trades. Closing positions and rolling positions are both options as long as there is liquidity. Being assigned is an inefficient use of margin and buying power in many instances.

There are lots of plays people post here that aren't ""Thetagang"", but not managing the positions you entered for Theta, when Theta's impact is practically gone, isn't much different.

I do agree that lots of people are coming here without understanding all of the implications of the particular trade strategy they enter, but there are plenty of people here Wheeling that aren't interested in learning the Greeks and how they impact their trade either.

I don't really think we as a community can get around the hurdle that is new people coming here and entering trades they don't understand with the assumption that they're some sort of safe YOLO.

I guess my advice for anyone would be... do whatever you want, just try to educate yourself so that you thoroughly understand whatever it is you're doing."

Do the 'rich' pay less tax?,"It's probably helpful to use an example. Say Company X spends one million on widget components and one million on wages for workers to put together the widgets, then sells the widgets for two million. The revenue was two million but the expenses were also two million, so Company's profit was $0. Because the company made no money, Company X/ the owner wouldn't pay taxes. 

  
The workers pay taxes on their income because that's their income. And the goods themselves are taxed. But the owner wouldn't be paying any taxes because they got nothing. Generally speaking**\*\***, deducting expenses isn't a magic trick that lets you avoid taxes on income. Expenses are money going out, meaning the company is losing money unless the revenue coming in matches or exceeds it.  


If, instead, Company X made three million selling the widgets, now there's a million in profit.  How that money gets taxed depends on the type of company. Company X could be a simple pass-through entity (like a sole proprietorship or LLC) where the business owner's profits are taxed like ordinary income.  If Company X is a C-corporation, it gets more complicated.  Then, the company itself has to pay taxes  *and* the business owner has to pay taxes on money paid to them, but the rates the business owner pays vary depending on how the money is distributed (income, ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, etc.).

  
**\*\*** I say ""generally speaking"" because there are ways for businesses to use expenses to avoid taxes on profits, which is probably what you hear about. Say in the first year Company X spends a million on widget components, a million on wages, and a million on equipment to put together the widgets, but only makes two million, *i.e.* the company lost a million dollars.  The next year, Company X spends a million on components, a million on wages, and sells the widgets for three million.  There's a profit of one million in year two, but Company X can ""carry forward"" the loss from year one to avoid taxes on that profit.   


That may sound shady but, if you think about it, over the course of the two years the company's profit was $0, so it makes sense there wouldn't be any tax on that. The carry forward provision exists because companies often lose money in their first few years (because they need to buy equipment, market themselves to get a consumer base, *etc.*). So the ""profit"" they make in year two or year three or whenever is illusory because the company had been losing money previously. The carry forward provision allows the company to even out the fluctuation in profits and losses from year to year.  


There's a lot, lot more, and there are unsavory ways business owners avoid taxes, just like their are unsavory ways people earning ordinary income avoid taxes.  But this post is already long enough, and I'm just trying to explain why being ""able to deduct expenses"" isn't nearly as fun, exciting, or profitable as people seem to think."

For example, [this calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=ReplaceAll%5BW*R%5ET*%28A%2BS*Sum%5B%28G%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%29%2C+%7BS+-%3E+48000%2C+G+-%3E+1%2C+R+-%3E+1.08%2F1.025%2C+T+-%3E+20%2C+W+-%3E+.04%2C+A+-%3E+0%7D%5D) shows that someone who invests $48K per year (adjusted each year for inflation) with a nominal annual return of 8%, an inflation rate of 2.5%, and a withdrawal rate in retirement of 4% would be able to withdraw $69K per year in \*today's dollars\* if they retire after 20 years. This also assumes they have nothing saved at the beginning (A=0)."
My no.1 tip to find gems before anyone else,"Lol are people not already doing this? There are so many forums you can check and accounts to follow to see who to trust with a hunch, but it’s just that. Past performance isn’t proof of further performance. 

Everyone SHOULD know their own level of risk and SHOULD be doing their own research. Listening to others that were previously right isn’t a strategy, it’s a gamble. Not judging anyone that does this but if you’re looking for something stable in alt-coins your best bet is to do the dirty work. Understand what makes a good coin, build some dd of your own to justify the purchase, set entry/exit levels, and understand how much emotion you can take if it goes south"

"Does ""Why nations Fail"" contradict ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" ?","Hi, historian here! 

Historians tend to loathe Diamond's book because it is environmental determinism and most historians believe this to be a very overdetermined thesis. I haven't read all of Why Nations Fail but am a historian of Latin America. I know that much of the scholarship examining Mexico's economic prospects look at the following: consistent war throughout the 19th century that expanded agriculture but didn't develop industrialization; the cost of developing railways through a mountainous nation when the most developed railway companies were foreign (USA); and industrialization coming into the country as a means of supplementing the North's consumer market. Much of Latin America hasn't been able to develop and industrialize in similar patterns to Europe and N. America \*because\* they continuously are supplementing those regions with primary resources, brain drain, and labor drain. Some economists agree with the thesis but it was first developed by sociologist and economic historian Immanuel Wallerstein in his books *The Modern World System* which is a 4 volume serios that traces mercantilism's rise to the rise of capitalism from the 16th to 19th centuries.   


TL;DR most accounts contradict Diamond bc he is so deterministic about environment. I don't know how Economists think about"

Why are UK brokerages so expensive?,"US share dealing is predatory and shouldn't be used as a measuring stick.  At least not a positive one.  Payment For Order Flow is abundant and many brokerages are offsetting their costs by selling out their users data on mass.  You are not the platforms customer, you are the product they sell to clearing houses and investment institutes.

UK is smaller and better regulated.  Also, its still kind of behind the times and needs to catch up on what a reasonable online platform should offer.  The competition is growing and will catch up.  My personal preference would be ii.  I'm currently with HL and I don't rate them."
"Heads up: The federal government just filed suit against Navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. This is huge.","They have been pulling shit like this for years, and I am glad it finally caught up to them.

Several years ago my wife had 40k in student loans with Navient. One loan and was 16k and the other 24. I got a seperation check from the navy and sent a 16k payment over the phone instructing them to pay off the one loan, which they assured me they could do. I was very specific that if it did not pay off the loan I did not want to make that large of a payment.

After they had taken the money they decided to distribute the payment across both loans. I called them and they claimed that they did not need to put the money where I specified as they way they disbursed it saved me money.

After 2 weeks of calling my bank and Navient multiple times a day I called Navient and told them if they didn't apply the payment on the way I specified I would file a complaint with the CFPB. 

All the sudden they were more than willing to fix my issue and apply my payment to the loan the way I had asked.

TLDR: Fuck Navient and their bullshit."

Does welfare pay for itself?,"Maybe! It depends on when, and on what program as well.

We should separate two arguments. The first you mention is around business cycles; in these situations some welfare programs can stimulate the economy. Since low-income people tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume, they can grow GDP in the short run. [Auerbach &amp;  Gorodnichenko  (2011)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17447.pdf) shows that welfare spending is more beneficial to GDP during a recession, for example. While these arguments have merit, it's important to note that they don't always apply.

In the longer term, it really depends on what program. /u/DrunkenAsparagus linked to a [really good paper on this here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hendren/files/welfare_vnber.pdf) (with [accompanying visualization here](https://www.policyinsights.org/#)) in another thread. To sum up some of the results, programs vary widely both in their cost to the government and in their value to the recipients. In grouping policy types together, policies aimed at child education and health in particular have a negative cost to the government (meaning they pay back their cost to the government, and then some) and a very high value to the recipients. Some policies pay a portion of their cost back, but not all of it. Some policies can actually impose an additional cost--if they discourage people from working, for example.

Lastly, this recent paper from [Bastian &amp; Jones](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/paper/zB4hn9nf) analyzed the Earned Income Tax Credit and found it likely repays about 83% of its budgetary cost to the government."

How do rising interest rates combat inflation?,"There are at least a couple of different ways to think about this. One way is to realize that raising the federal funds target is synonymous with taking money out of the economy. In order to push the rate up, the fed sells bonds and takes that money effectively out of circulation, lowering the money supply.

Another way to think about it is to realize that higher interest rates disincentivize economic activity. Saving becomes more attractive relative to consumption. Borrowing becomes more expensive, raising the cost of investment and consumption of durables. This lowers aggregate demand and puts downward pressure on inflation."
What would happen if all companies were employee owned?,"We get asked this every few months, I'm going to copy and paste from some replies I gave recently...

You mentioned making your own company mutual. Those who advocate co-operatives believe that it can be an emergent outcome of an economy.  So, no dictator is need to force equality.  That's usually the hope behind Mutualism, though your view may be different. There are reasons to be sceptical of this.

Let's say that every business in the economy is a co-operative.  Often it's specified that each business must be a worker co-operative.  Straight away this causes a problem.  What about a co-operative of two people, for example?  Suppose that myself and my wife start a co-operative with £1M of capital.  Another couple have a co-operative with £1 of capital.  The return of these would clearly be very different!  In other words, what is the threshold?  What co-op has so few members that it's effectively private?

Another issue is different rates of profit.  This can happen for various reasons.  Let's say we have two worker co-operatives each with similar numbers of members/workers.  These two also have similar amounts of capital.  The members of each vote for the committee managing the enterprise.  What if one co-op elects good management and the other bad management?  In that case the members of one co-op would become much poorer and the members of the other richer.

Notice that I don't have to look at much that's specific about the co-operative form itself here.  What I'm talking about here is mostly just the way every business works applied to the case of a worker co-op.

A related problem applies to capital.  In some industries lots of capital is used.  In others only a small amount of capital.  A window cleaner can use a few ladders, a few buckets, and maybe a van.  A silicon chip company needs more.  That's true per-worker as well.  More capital means higher returns.  So, why should a co-op with a lot of capital look for new members?  New members will only water down the capital share owned by each existing member.  As a result, the co-op will charge new member for joining.  These charges are not theoretical, worker co-ops that exist make them, they're called buy-ins.  (For this reason there's a theory of supply for co-ops that's slightly different to other businesses).  So, some people who are relatively wealthy will be able to buy-into co-ops that are relatively profitable.

In this Mutualist world capital and labour haven't disappeared. It's just that the roles are fulfilled by the same people. The workers of a worker co-op are both worker and capitalist, as such they receive both labour and capital income. They must fulfil the corresponding roles. They must show patience and not spend all their capital. They must fulfil the entrepreneurial decision making role.  Some people must still decide what products are to be made in what quantities, there must be direction of available resources within each co-op. If the workers do not do this collectively as part of their work then someone must be paid to do it. There must still be investment, so some people must wait before they can get a return. The workers in each co-op will have the right to all of the profit split into shares. But, they must invest in their business for the future, which will often mean retaining some of the profit. Of course, if borrowing is used for investment then someone else must lend. If every business is a co-op then that means another co-op must lend.

The love for SCHD,"I've tried to continue and find a group of stocks since I was 22 (now 28) that does the following:

1. Provides defense during economic downturns
2. Adequate stock price growth during bull markets.
3. Provides a second means of metric/income.

SCHD Does all the above:

1. Handpicks a select group of stocks that are more defined by marketcap minimum and dividend growth of atleast 10 years. These stocks are much more defensive, and thus do better than the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ during downturns.
2. It does a good job with other finances with these companies aside from point #1. As a result when a bull market does hit, you will see growth with SCHD.
3. The 10 dividend growth requirement will always see it filtering in and out companies with a strong payout, thus giving it a very good constant growth.

The yield for SCHD fluctuates between 2.5% (all time highs) and 4% (market lows), the key ""safespace"" for a company dividend outside of a REIT. If the dividend goes higher than 4%, the stock usually isn't growing too much or is stagnant. If the dividend is lower than 2.5%, you're better off just investing in the S&amp;P500, which has a 1.5%-2% dividend yield on average.

This was my research and what I saw with previous dividend ratios in the past. If you try to replicate this in a portfolio as well with a group of stocks, the same thing happens. Higher then 4%? Lower growth of the stock price. Lower than 2.5%? More volatility in the markets compared to S&amp;P and NASDAQ100

I keep SCHD in my brokerage account and Roth IRA."

If you have to ask you can’t afford it,"I think it’s a statement spun by salespeople who know that what they are selling is way overpriced or that there is hidden fees you’d question if you knew what they were. They’re masking this by saying ”oh but rich people don’t care”. It’s a kind of reverse psychology to pressure you too not ask questions. Because they know, they are ripping you off big time and they don’t want to show you that they are hence ”oh then it’s not for you if you want to know any specifics”. 

It’s like buying a car where the leather on the seats cost 40 000 usd, in reality it’s not very different from your standard leather and might even be worse than the one for 2000 usd, but if you have to ask for details you’re too poor so i’ll just sell it to someone who’s stupid enough to pay without asking questions.

If you get wealthy from scratch you probably have a sense of business. In the business world there’s haggling and the price is discussed and the details are discussed because getting a good deal and not getting ripped off matters. Billion dollar companies do this. Why wouldn’t you just because it’s your private money? Know what you buy, don’t get ripped off, don’t let other people rip you off, you should be a tough customer. Be a businessman/woman no matter whose money it is."

What do you think about the evidence supporting that 88% of the COVID19 economic downturn was due to voluntary decisions and not lockdown rules?,"As far as I can tell, the paper looks fine. Basically, what they do is use foot traffic data to compare, within a commuting zone, how changes in lockdown policy affect people's economic activity. In a simple example, there are two counties in a commuting zone, one of them locks down, the other doesn't, you then compare how their foot traffic levels change over time. It's more complicated and the researchers are more careful than this, but that's the basic idea. At least to me, their identification passes the smell test. Maybe there are some econometric issues I'm not aware of, but the paper seems fine. 

They find that economic activity fell by around 60 percentage points and that the lockdowns were responsible for about 7 of those 60 percentage points. The takeaway from the paper is that ending lockdowns will not be a ""cure"" for the decreased economic activity and that economic recovery depends on people feeling secure enough to go outside and spend money like they normally would."

These crazy headlines and wild price swings are definitely interesting and I could have made a lot of money had I bought then, but I stand by my conclusion. GME is not and was not a value investment. “Smart speculation” is not value investing. It is still speculation. 

It’s a cool case study in investor psychology and fun to watch, but be careful you aren’t tempted by volatility into becoming just like the masses of gamblers masquerading as investors. This is not a great company at a good price. This is not a good company at a great price. This is no place for a value investor to play around. The questions you are asking (“when is it going to tip...?””...would that constitute a intelligent asymmetrical bet?”) are speculation questions."

"Dad died, house is in foreclosure, behind on car payments.. what do we do?","Oh god. I HOPE YOU SEE MY POST. Foreclosure attorney here. A LOT of misinformation in here. 

First thing to determine: do you want to keep the house?

If yes, apply for a mortgage modification. Applying for that won’t magically raise your payments to $500. A modification has to be approved and accepted by both parties. Also, if you’re applying for a mortgage modification and you don’t meet the bank metrics for lower monthly payments, you’ll just be denied. No punishment. Also, applying for a modification immediately stops the foreclosure process by law. It’ll buy you some time. 

DO NOT do what 98% of the comments in here say. DO NOT make slightly higher payments to “catch up”. By the time you would have caught up, the bank will have foreclosed on you anyway and you will have literally pissed away the extra money. If the bank has already started the process, with them it’s modification, pay full owed, or bust (if you want to keep the home). 

If they deny a modification, and you want to keep the home, you can see if you qualify for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Seek a BK attorney, most give free consults and will tell you if you’ll qualify. Do not do a Chapter 7, you’d still lose the home. 

Good luck. "
"I'm Nick Timiraos, chief economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Ask me anything","Hi Nick, I just read Trillion Dollar Triage and must say it's an excellent book.

Given the historical context of how the Fed has battled inflation in the past, I am convinced that the Fed now sees it as a requirement to overshoot on interest rates even if that risks a significant recession. I think Powell said as much when he told the public to expect ""pain"". He wants to avoid entrenchment and keep longer term inflation expectations down, which means acting aggressively for an extended period.

Many of the forward indicators appear to be sharply rolling over, which in my opinion is a direct result of Powell's tone moreso than the interest rates themselves. Do you think the Fed feels like what they're doing is working?"

What are economists’ take on capitalism and socialism?,"I suggest you read [State versus Private Ownership](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.4.133) paper by Andrei Shleifer who is currently the #1 ranked economist in RePEc, i think it answers your question as directly as possible although the author defines ""socialism"" as nationalization of industries. The paper is lit review of theoretical and political-economy work on privatization &amp; state ownernship.  

&gt;Private ownership should generally be preferred to public ownership when the incentives to innovate and to contain costs must be strong. In essence, this is the case for capitalism over socialism, explaining the ‘‘dynamic vitality’’ of free enterprise[...]. Moreover, many of the concerns that private firms
fail to address ‘‘social goals’’ can be addressed through government contracting and regulation, without resort to government ownership.

Other highly ranked economists in RePEc like Acemoglu would also agree that private property rights is fundamental to long run prosperity."

Could the rise of 'work from home' cause more jobs to be off-shored to cheaper countries?,"Firms will offshore when the marginal benefit of moving the job exceeds the marginal cost of moving the job. For exposition, imagine that a firm has employees who have a distribution of skill from low to high. You can imagine that the low skill workers might be call center employees while the high skill workers might be the people in the CTOs office making big decisions about strategy and toolset. 

Think about the firm iteratively considering whether to offshore the next job. Initially they're all located in the US. First the firm looks at the low-skill call center workers and considers the marginal benefit of offshoring them (lower labor costs) against the marginal costs (reduced sales due to weaker customer service, bureaucratic complexity, etc) and decide to move the call center to India. Next they look at the next highest skill workers, maybe the IT help desk. The marginal benefit is still the reduction in salaries but there is a different marginal cost as well. Not having your IT worker in the same time zone could mean that it takes longer for the finance folks to get their problems fixed. Maybe they still decide to offshore the IT help desk. In each case, the firm is considering whether the marginal costs exceed the marginal benefits and will only offshore workers for whom the marginal benefits are high relative to the marginal costs.

As other folks have pointed out, it's non-trivial to assume that people in other countries do the work as well. Time zone is a huge barrier and the talent pool is generally not as good as it is in developed countries.  The fact that Google is willing to pay people in the Bay Area $250k instead of hiring someone in Delhi suggests they see some benefit to onshoring.

 Has the rise of WFH fundamentally changed this equation? I don't think so. In my mind, what's more likely is that employers will offer employees bonuses to leave SF/NYC/LA for lower cost of living cities within the US and adjust their salaries (Facebook already did this)."
Why is Russia still poor even though it has all the requisites to be rich?,"Having natural resources is no guarantor for wealth or growth. In fact, it can hinder the development of other industries and effectively render them not competitive (Dutch Disease). 

Having a large share of tertiary education does not mean that people are highly educated. If degrees are easy to obtain, the indicator is worthless. Also, a huge chunk of educated personell fled after the USSR collapsed.

Technologically wise I personally don't think that the Russian economy can compete with Western or Asian counterparts.

The country also hugely reliant on natural resources and agriculture, which are typically not seen as sectors with high value added.

Moreover, institutional quality is low, for instance due to high corruption, and the country is extremely unequal with most of the wealth concentrated in oligarchs."

Does Milton Friedman's statement about the welfare state hold up to scrutiny?,"&gt;	The welfare state encourages family's to break up. 

At the time when Milton Friedman was active, I believe this was commonly thought to be so since there was a strong correlation between welfare generosity (to single mothers) and single motherhood. Then, as economists started becoming more serious about endogeneity, the consideration that 1. areas with more single mothers are likely to pass more generous single mother benefits and 2. areas more culturally ok with single motherhood are more likely to pass more generous benefits, which all would confound and cause a false positive correlation lead to [Moffit (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/146113), where after adjusting for fixed effects, this relationship disappeared for whites, but remained for blacks. And shortly after, [Hoynes (1997)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5149) went further in thinking about confounders, and finds that the relationship between welfare generosity and single motherhood in black families disappears when you account for migration- i.e. welfare generosity does not seem to *cause* families to break up, but people more likely to become single mothers selectively move to states that offer better benefits. I believe this result is generally accepted even today.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;	The welfare state produces poor people. 

I have made several posts about similar claims to this, and I think this partially talks to this claim. Using the 'official' poverty measures which are based on income, which people tend to misreport and literally do not reflect increases in welfare (i.e. if you get health insurance coverage from the state, this wont be seen in a measure of your income, but it will be seen in changes in your consumption. Consumption also what theoretically matters more so than income)  and does not properly adjust for inflation, and which also capture alot of young college educated people and others who are not really who we think of as 'poor', then it does not look like many great society and welfare schemes have done much for helping poor people. However when you switch to more accurate consumption based measures and adjust for inflation properly, poverty has actually decreased quite a bit due to anti poverty polices, over the past few decades- estimated up to [26.4 percentage point decline](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18718). more on how to properly measure poverty and why the 'official' measure is not great can be found [here](https://www.nber.org/papers/w14827).

Indulging in the playboy / party lifestyle after a fat exit,"The first thing I did that was completely stupid was that I bought a Viper convertible.

That led to the second thing I did that was completely stupid.  

So I told the wife that just once in my life, I would like a 1000+ car.  I bought another Viper and had the tuner modify it, twin turbo, 1300+ HP, and it was used in and won a couple of magazine competitions against far more expensive cars, like Bugatti.  It made the covers of 4 car mags in the US and EU.  My car briefly held 2 speed records for street legal cars.

I was fun to drive and I raced it at a local track vs Ferrari, Lambo, Mazzers, Astons, BMW Ms, MB AMGs, Porsches, Ford GT, and lots of other things.  I beat them all except for one Porsche that was a purpose built American Lemans Series race car running on racing slicks.  I could drive past him on the straights, but he beat me in the curves,  

The best day ever with that car, Walter Reed hospital brought a bus load of wounded vets and their nurses to the track.  The Ferrari club had set it up and asked me to participate.  Soldiers with missing limbs, horrible burns, and all sorts of other problems got a day as a passenger in cars that cost anywhere from $200K - $2M.  Many of the soldiers had to be lifted from wheel chairs and placed into our cars. We set it up in 20 min races with very defined passing rules to protect both passengers and cars.  Each race the soldier would swap out and go in a  different car.  

It was a wet day and at one point, a $1M collectible Ferrari two cars in front of me spun out, going off track and then back across, dragging mud with him.  The Lambo behind him over corrected and spun out in the mud.  I couldn't break because there was another Lambo only a few feet from my rear bumper so I eased up and drove as gently thru the mess as I could.  The Lambo and Ferrari behind me also spun out.  The soldier beside me, looking back at the cars spinning all over yelled, ""THAT WAS AMAZING!! LET'S DO IT AGAIN!!""  When we got back to the pits, my soldier passenger was telling everyone what had happened and how I was the only driver to get thru that corner.  

They had to shut the track down for an hour to clean and dry it.  Most of the soldiers came over to me and my car in the pits to take pictures of themselves with the American car that beat everything Europe and Japan ever produced.  My home office walls are decorated with photos of that day.

&gt; #The trouble with writing a pop-econ book

&gt; So you're a distinguished researcher in economics. You've made a career out of carefully measuring $input and painstakingly documenting the causal effect of $input on $outcome. Your work is celebrated in a dozen top-5 articles. So you decide that it's time to cash in and write a pop-econ book about how $input affects $outcome.

&gt; You start with a [picture.](https://i.imgur.com/huQ9GG3.png) This is the partial plot of your $input against $outcome. You've waved a magic wand that solves all identification issues, so this *is* the causal effect. Just to be clear, you can run a suitably high-powered [regression](https://i.imgur.com/480yncP.png) through this data and get an economically and statistically significant effect. Great! [fn1]

&gt; Clearly there's variation you can't explain with $input, because other stuff is going on as well. The world isn't monocausal.

&gt; Anyway.

&gt; Your book has to sell with a popular audience, so you can't just print out regression tables. You have to tell a story. Well, the data in a regression encodes a story: behind the data points in a scatterplot is history of policy across observation units. So you pick out a few [case studies](https://i.imgur.com/clWeNQF.png) and center the book around an examination of those case studies.

&gt; And you sell your book. And people review it. And everyone wants to take a piece out of you.

&gt; Some commentators scoff at your $input. Look, they say, $input doesn't do anything to affect $output. Look at [these case studies.](https://i.imgur.com/5PDPetu.png) We vary $input by a factor of three, and *nothing changes* to $outcome. 

&gt; Other commentators point out that many observation units with roughly the same level of $input have massively different outcomes. Look at [these case studies.](https://i.imgur.com/yR3Jgah.png) All of these observation units have similar levels of $input, but their outcomes differ dramatically. What gives?

&gt; Some smartass commentators even turn the tables on you. Look at [these case studies.](https://i.imgur.com/IYEm6Uh.png) Now it appears that $input has a *negative* effect on the outcome! How could anyone take your new book seriously?

Is the rise of dual income households related to why everything is so expensive these days?,"I'm not quite sure what you are referring to.

Real (meaning adjusted for change in prices) disposable personal income per person is [higher than ever](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0) and has steadily increased, as you can see.

People are likewise able to buy more. People have similarly  [been consuming more goods and services per capita over time](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A794RX0Q048SBEA)

If you look back 40-50 years, when boomers were in their prime, you can clearly see they were worse off. It's not even close, they made and were only able to consume about half as much as we can now.

Women aren't just laborers, their consumers too. They increase the supply of labor, but they likewise increase the demand for labor. In addition, many of women's work in the past was ""unpaid"" or ""off the books"", like simple household work which took far more time in the past to do than it does today with modern technology and appliances.

Starting Stock,"I am talking about investing here, not trading.  They are very different.  Warren Buffet is an investor, Jordan Belfort was a trader. 

Usually people start investing with $10,000.  But you can do it in $500 blocks on sharebuilder.com.  Buy $500 worth of a single stock, then save up another $500 to invest in a different stock.  Avoid buying all your stocks in the same market sector to diversify a little.  Once you have a few, you can buy additional $500 blocks of stocks you already have.  Keep the equivalent of 10% (since you are young) of your stock investment in bonds for security.  As you get older, increase the % in bonds. 

0) Unfortunately stocks are the only investment that steadily out paces inflation and interest rates, so you want to buy and hold stocks or ETFs.  Not mutual funds.  When you read Lynch's book it will be clear why.

1)  Start studying ""Dividend Aristocrats"" stocks.  These are stocks that have paid dividends for 25 consecutive years.  Also look at stocks that will soon be aristocrats, over 15 years consecutive dividends.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats

What you want to note is the dividend yield, it is a percentage.  For example for Johnson &amp; Johnson, JNJ, it is 2.9% and for HCP it is 5.7%.  But you also want to look at the dividend ratio to make sure all the earnings are not going to dividends, 80 -110% is bad.  Also look at company debt to make sure they are not borrowing to pay dividends.  For two stocks that are very close to each other, compare Return on Assets and Return on Equity to find the one with better management and buy that one.

2)  Plan to hold your investments for at least five years before you take your profits.  Unless a stock drops 40% (and the whole market isn't crashing the same %) do not sell.  Waiting a few months to a year will see the stock recover and start rising again.

3)  Calculate your 'load' to purchase your stock:  add the fees to buy and the fees to sell, calculate this as a % of your purchase, and subtract it from the yield.  If this is a negative number then do not buy at that yield (price).

eg, if it costs you $6 to make a buy and $6 to sell, a purchase of $600 worth of stock has a 'load' of 2%,  so you would earn 0.9% on JNJ and 3.7% on HCP.  (This math is not perfect as it doesn't account for you holding the stock for multiple years but it still works!)

One more test: compare the adjusted yield to the return on the best bond you can afford.  For you this will be EE or I bonds purchased direct (yay no load!) from treasurydirect.gov.  EE bonds are at 0.1% and I bonds are at 1.38%.  So you would not buy JNJ since it is lower than the bond yield, but HCP is above it so it passes our test.  

4)  Do not try to buy at the best possible price, just buy at a price low enough to get you the best yield.  Using sharebuilder you will not be able to control exactly when the buy will happen, unless you pay for a dealer assisted trade and this is too much for the small buys you will be making.  Since the goal is to buy and hold, small changes in price are not critical.  Timing the market is very difficult, don't try to do it.

5)  The best part about buying dividend paying stocks on sharebuilder is you get free dividend re-investment.  This means you earn a small slice of stock that will then earn you more future dividends.  This creates a compounding effect!  Be sure to set this up in your account.

Before you start investing you should have an emergency fund and be liquid.  Being liquid means you earn enough money to cover all your expenses.  You must not get in a situation where you have to sell your investments at a loss because you need cash.  Having an emergency fund is to prevent this losing situation.

Retrieving ETH from deceased sibling,"Hi. You are going to get private messages from scammers. Please do not accept help in a private message.

I recommend doing a lot of reading.  Really take time to understand Ethereum, private and public keys, ledger before you even attempt to unlock his ledger. Really, take weeks  or months to do this.

You also might look and see if he had an account with Coinbase or Gemini. You could probably check his bank accounts to see if there were deposits/withdrawals that say ""Coinbase or Gemini""  Then it would just be a matter of contacting these companies. 

 Eventually you would need his pin number and passwords for the Ledger and Encrypted files. You would also be looking for a seed phrase- 24 words that act as private keys... I really suggest not doing this until you are very familiar with Ethereum and blockchain security.  Buy yourself a ledger and practice sending and receiving money on it.  As far as the SSD you could connect it to a dedicated offline computer (but a cheap computer and never connect it to the internet) and see what info he has provided.

Whatever you do don't store pass phrases or private keys on a phone or computer or take a photo of it.  Pen and paper are your friend.

How to start a hedge fund,"https://youtu.be/5daXfre6sxE

I started my hedge fund in 2012. 

Most hedge funds fail because founders overlook the back office while preferring to focus on strategies (don’t we all?). I highly recommend that you don’t just use a turnkey solution, because it commingles your risk, increases your overall cost, and doesn’t provide you with any edge, making it harder to take on new investors in the end. I could go on forever but will stop here and go back to my work. 

If you guys prefer I do an AMA, happy to do one if it’s within the rules here.

"Economists, what do you think most other economists get wrong?","As someone in a PhD program right now- now that I've seen the material that a rigorous program will teach its students, I'm more surprised at the lack of statistical rigor in a lot of papers. Of course, there are (subjective) tiers of journals and departments, but as we recently saw in the Lee et. al paper on IV, even the AER is susceptible to academics that don't perform due diligence.

A second pet peeve is actually close to the other end of the spectrum- econometricians that obsess over incremental improvements to estimation procedures in ways that will probably never be implemented by any person outside their narrow sub-field. At some point, it amounts to mental masturbation. But I'll also add that most published research is probably just as useless and it's more a feature of our tenure system than someone getting too much joy out of their niche stats.

A third one- economists that are dismissive of other sub-fields, or even other fields/departments. Just be nice."

Is investing really the universal secret to getting rich?,"Investing and making random trades on a phone app are not the same thing.  
If it only takes you $37 to learn that, it's a very cheap lesson.

So.. stop using robinhood, avoid random phone apps that do god knows what behind the scenes, don't believe that you're just a few YOLO trades from getting rich and start being a calm and disciplined investor instead.

Specifically:

- Accept that you are not an investment genius. I'm not, and neither is anybody I know. We are generally not going to ""beat the market"" and get crazy high returns by picking the right stocks. Yes, you're going to hear continuously about those few people that made it big and how everyone can somehow do what they did. They got lucky, and no, most people cannot do it. It's okay.  
- Make a very boring, very predictable plan. I recommend a [three fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) where you pick 3 broad index funds that aren't correlated, capture most of the market upside and have low fees. Pick an allocation between those 3 funds that matches your risk tolerance/stage of life (you'll probably have most of your money allocated in a broad domestic stock fund, a bit in a broad international stock fund , and not a lot in a broad bond fund, with the bond allocation slowly increasing over the years.)  
- Open a brokerage account with a reputable firm. I'd recommend Vanguard, but there are a bunch of reasonable choices there, like Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, etc.  
- Tweak your work's direct deposit to [send a percentage of every paycheck to your brokerage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp), and setup your brokerage to automatically invest each of those deposits into your three funds in the proportions you've chosen above.  
- Once you've done that and you can see that your paychecks are being split correctly, just don't touch it anymore. Let it ride, preferably for several decades. There will be years where your investments lose money, and it's okay. No need to panic. Most years your investments will grow. By allocating part of each paycheck to your investments, you are practicing [Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) which will improve your personal rate of return.

That's the general idea. If your employer provides retirement plans, like a [401K plan](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/401k-info.asp), you will want to use them as well, because they provide tax benefits over your taxable brokerage account.

Think of all this as a basic investing hygiene. There are many many other things you can do on top of this, but you can get up to speed on those later. It starts with consistently saving and investing into reasonably safe and balanced instruments."
I sincerely don't understand $META,"This is the definition of value investing.

Meta is an amazingly run business, it’s one of my largest positions, and will always be able to make loads of money. How they make that money might change, but as long as they keep making that money I’m still holding."

Another key thing to look into/consider is that DRS shares are outside of the SIPC $500K insurance that brokerage accounts have by default.

They are directly tied to Cede &amp; Co. and the DTC, meaning in case of a brokerage default, your shares there will be safe, and not subject to being disappeared and you're left with a $500K or less consolation prize.

Can we talk about what this pandemic did to us?,"Personally, I work at a grocery store.  Earning just above minimum wage.  The overseas company that owns the chain is raking in money.  Everyone eating at home.  Think about that...there is no competition for seafood/meat buying because all of the independent restaurants are closing, colleges and cafeterias are closed.  The supermarket is the only place buying the stuff, yet they are hacking up the prices.  We got a $5 gift certificate and some candy as a thank you a couple of months ago.

A lot of people in my area collected more in PUA than I earn working 40 hours a week.

And yet we still get treated like shit.  Last night I walked away from a customer who was swearing at me because I didn’t know what brand of pasta was on sale.  He then proceeded to pull down his mask and lick his fingers to hand me cash.  I walked away.  My boss finished the transaction and the customer continued to berate me and asked for my name.  Which my boss gave him.

People are arguing about prices, coupons, having to touch the pin pad, “Where is your sanitizer!!”  Etc.

Gimme a fucking break.  Your life is NOT more important than mine.

And I happen to be educated.  I was substitute teaching before the pandemic.  I just want to work and provide for my family.  I do not make decisions about prices.

Is the entire Zillow fiasco an example of how Mathematical/computational and mechanical treatment of Finance and Economics is a failure?,"Ironically, zillow lost a lot of money because it didn't have a lot of economics in their predictions, so no economic theory and financial economics are not to blame and do not need to be revised because zillow lost a ton of money. 

You can read a more thorough breakdown of why people think Zillow lost money [here](https://ryxcommar.com/2021/11/06/zillow-prophet-time-series-and-prices/) (we won't know for certain until zillow discloses exactly what their methods were), but the most likely story is that they focused on predicting prices and not on adverse selection. In short, even if you can predict prices with super high levels of accuracy, you can still very easily lose money because the only people who will sell to you are people who think that they are getting a really good offer.  Zillow needed way more economic theory in their predictions, and standard economic/finance theory would have told them that what they were doing was a very dangerous idea.

You can make a poker/gambling analogy where Zillow is always dealt slightly better cards than everyone else at the table, but Zillow always has to bet first. This means that the only people who will ever take Zillow's bet are going to be people who think they have a better hand. From there it's really easy to see how Zillow could lose lots of money."

Eth price is deliberately sabotaged,"I know a lot of people will say that this is nonsense but I actually believe it is right. This isn't the first time either. The last time I suspected this was in September last year. Every time we had a 'break-out' the price got completely shattered on. Then finally we had a massive break out and the beast was unleashed.


Somewhere during our bull-run, we had some people selling entire chunks of 22,000 Ether at once, which in my opinion doesn't really make sense. Just sell it in chunks or OTC and you will get a higher price than selling it below market price, unless you, of course, want to try and stir chaos and call the top. 


Anyhow you don't need a lot of money or people to keep the price down if you know what you're doing. Especially when your entire business model revolves around Bitcoin, you don't want Ethereum to take the spotlight. Remember Bitcoin is an ideology, Ethereum is technology. Best to keep somewhere around 200 mil around to dump it back to $300 levels and re-buy slowly to not increase the price too much. One way to get a full break-out is to acknowledge this and use it to your advantage by buying the dip once our bull run takes off (which I suspect will). Hoping the dumper runs out of his coins and will have to re-enter at a higher price. And of course to understand the fundamentals of Ethereum.

Please invest in mutual funds/ETFs directly if you're young instead of stocks - A personal experience,"&gt; I used to check kite everyday and would feel the need to ""re-balance"" my portfolio because some other stock was doing well.

Regarding this 'need to rebalance', I think this can be done differently. Instead of selling the best-performing stock, we can buy more of the other stocks so that the portfolio is 'rebalanced'. As they say - ""Let your winners ride"". It's counterproductive to sell a stock just because it's performing well. 

Simply buy &amp; hold a mix of quality and emerging companies. Don't sell the good performers. Buy more of them during markets crashes/correction.

"I have $379,000 after taxes","Just a few numbers to consider:

If you save the entire 379k, don’t spend any of it, and don’t save another dollar for your retirement for the rest of your life, you can expect to have just over 3 million dollars invested when you are ~~60~~ 50 years old.  That means that if you do absolutely nothing with this money you can retire early at age 50 with a 3 million dollar portfolio that will pay you $105k a year in retirement.  That’s assuming the market average of 8% growth a year and. 3.5% withdrawal rate in retirement.

Do nothing, retire early with a six figure salary.

If you gift and spend a bunch now and only invest 150k today you will only have 1.2 million dollars at age 50 which can provide 42k a year in retirement.  Gifting your parents a house and buying a mobile home now will cost you nearly 2 million dollars in 27 years.

Every $1,000 you spend today costs you $7,988 of potential savings in retirement at age ~~60~~ 50.  

Every $1,000 you spend today costs you $20,115 in potential savings if you work until 67 and retire “normally.”

That means that the $50,000 you give to your parents today is costing you $1 million dollars at age 67.  That’s a very generous gift. 

Be sure you’re considering the future potential value of this money as you spend it today.  Your youth makes this math very exciting.

ELI5:Why is NZ and Scandinavia so high on Ease of Doing Business rankings despite high public spending?,"It’s because public spending doesn’t necessarily mean it’s regulatorily difficult to start or maintain a business charter.

For the US, that could very well mean a vast overhaul and complete shift to a publicly owned healthcare system, or just an expansion of the existing one with relatively minor changes.

Does universal healthcare imply the loss of jobs? No. Is it possible to have a system of universal healthcare that would cause substantial job losses? Sure. But that could be the case for a non-universal system as well. The actual implementation matters."

Think about a house flip: you put in $10k, increase value by $20k or $30k. Now think about applying the same principle to an entire apartment building: 12 units, 20 units, 50 units, 100 units. Whatever you can do in the apartments to increase the rents will increase the value of the building by a multiple of the increase in annual cash flow. You can buy something for $2M and with the right tweaks, turn it into something that is worth $3M.

The ""ultimate"" value add opportunity is ground up development. It is also the most risky. If you can double your money every 2-3 years, then you will get to big numbers very quickly.

People who rely on appreciation to get rich are taking advantage of a similar phenomenon, but they are ceding control of that phenomenon to the economy. You can hope that inflation goes up and interest rates keep going down to push values higher and higher. Or you can take action yourself to push values higher and higher.

Control over the property is one of the best advantages of real estate compared.

**Leverage**

If the bank will loan you 70% of the cost of the project, then your margins are even better. 20% unlevered becomes 40% levered. You have less money in the deal, which means you can do a bigger deal or you can put the same amount of money to work in more deals.

The more money you have, the more money the banks want to lend you. You will get lower interest rates and better terms on your loans as well.

If you want to keep a property after finishing your value add work, then you can refinance it and pull cash out for your next deal that way.

**Tax Code**

The obvious provision of the tax code for folks at scale is the 1031 exchange. Rather than sell the property, pay taxes on the gains, and use the remaining proceeds for the next deal, the tax code allows for you to sell at the same time as you buy. You don't see any of the cash: an intermediary holds it for you between the two closings. This let's you take advantage of compounding returns on money that would have otherwise gone to taxes.

If you refinance and take out money that way, then that isn't taxable either because it is debt.

The another tax advantage in real estate is depreciation. The building does depreciate in the sense that it is used up over time, but it generally does not actually go down in value which makes this more of a phantom expense. Cost segregation allows more of that depreciation expense to be taken earlier on new deals. Then you can write off those losses against taxable rental income from the other properties."

Damn I Love Real Estate!,"Kudos to you and your wife for the successful journey so far.  

My journey is almost exactly like yours (even the engineering job) except I started 13 years ago at the start of the last housing crisis.  My first 2 properties were in Chicago that I'd already bought foreclosed but continued to fall 60 more percent.  I was really turned off by real estate for at least half a decade before I got back into it again. Admittedly, the last decade in real estate has been a rocket, but bear in mind that your journey thus far has only been a heavy bull period.  The market is cyclical and it will definitely turn at some point.  Make sure to keep that in mind.

Would anyone be interested in a beginner series of posts?,"I'd love this. Thank you! 

One thing I'm finding trouble with is going from thesis to code/execution. I'm a total newb coder, but have solid investing experience from work and personally. 

An example for me: can we use weighting changes in major indices as a predictor of long vs. short prospects? For example, if NASDAQ or DJIA is seeing returns from 5-10 top players and the rest are flat/decreasing, what does this tell us about price direction? Could go the other way: what does overperformance of smaller caps in the indices tell us? 

Thinking it's more than just small vs. large caps. It's a matter of the small % driving returns vs. what is happening to the rest of the index."

For some, it could be an American community college for all they care. Often times, employers in Jordan (in smaller and more local companies) can't really tell the difference between the University of Michigan and Glendale Community College. The prestige predominantly is associated with Western higher education because people broadly perceive most things Western as relatively superior. Those people can even include potential employers. Beyond this, a lot of people just want to live in the West for the sake of living there - potentially due to culture and experiences.

My experiences in this regard are within the context of Jordan, and are not necessarily PhD-related, but maybe they provide some relevant insight into why this phenomenon exists."

The sleight of hand that every investor should be aware of,"While I applaud your post,  allow me to point out a few things,
1.  This is not a trick,  it is required under GAAP.  
2.  Looking only at the balance sheet change in shares and cash flows necessarily looks fishy, since SBc is by definition non cash. You need to look at the stock comp line item of the statement of equity, but it’s important to understand in the statement or equity this is the amortization of invested outstanding awards, not what’s vested.  Should equal to the non cash line item in the operating section.
3. The actual average share repurchase price is a required disclosure typically,are under part 1,  item 5.  I will edit with the location in aapl 10-k.
4.  Per GAAP rules, the non cash expense recognized over the life of the award is typically the share value at the time of grant,  not the time of vesting. This is offset in APIC.  This expense may have nothing to do with the value of the vested awards.
5. If you want to know the fair value of stock awards that vested during the year,  this is a required disclosure in the notes, I’ll edit with its location in aapl.
6. Your math to arrive at the 14.8 is simply incorrect. It might get you close to the vested fair market value of shares, but it might not depending on the price at vesting of SBC versus the price at share repurchase of treasury . The statement that only 76 of the 91 cash used to repurchase shares in the financing section is wrong,  all 91 was used to purchase the 656.  It would be non GAAP and an error if the company put any cash flows from stock comp in financing. Stock comp is non cash and compensation goes in operating if it is cash. 

Wait one while i find the location of the items above…

Edit:
Number 3 above,  my bad SEC recently changed the rule, part 1 item 5 (on page 18) only requires the most recent quarter disclosure.   So in the 10k you can’t tie to the 656 for the whole year, but you could add up this disclosure from the 10-k and previous three quarters and get there,  with the average repurchase price by month.
 Number 5 19 million is the actual vesting stock fair value (quite different than 14.8) on page 48 in the stock comp note.

Edit 2.  Sorry for the font,  I don’t know how to fix it.  I’m old.

Edit 3, I think I figured out the font.  Made minor wording changes that may have been inaccurate, and:  if the intent is to adjust results to show as if the company sold shares and paid employees cash, rather than GAAP stock comp rules,  reduce net income by the 19 million from page 48 but also add back the non cash stock comp expense. then make a similar adjustment to EPS by dividing by basic shares outstanding on EPS.  Using dilutive shares is probably misleading for this excercise. Increase financing cash flows by 19 million for sale of stock,  then remove the stock comp line in operating cash flows, while taking into account the revised (net) net income.   Net cash should stay the same.

Edit 4:  sorry to be a putz,  but I’m taking issue with the phrase “ modern accounting”. FAR 123r was issued in 2006.  It’s pretty old as accounting standards go."

Can someone explain to me why deflation would be a bad thing?,"The TLDR is that when you have a change to aggregate demand prices must move to offset this - including wages. Upward changes aren't really any issue, because hey, who doesn't like to be paid more (even if it's just nominal)? However, individuals are extremely hesitant to accept lower nominal wages and this ""stickiness"" results in employers having to fire people because they cannot afford to retain them at those elevated wages, so in return you end up with significant unemployment. This can also cause a vicious cycle because if people have little to no income because they lost their job they will be more hesitant to spend and this can cause a greater shock to aggregate demand. 

I understand this is tricky, but it's also extremely important to understanding why deflation is such a massive problem. To further elaborate, I am most familiar with the Great Depression in particular and so will explain why deflation (and the gold standard) were problematic within that context. I am also tired, so pretty much everything I am about to say is also excerpted from [my blog post on the subject.](https://laowyatt.net/the-great-depression-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-inflation/)

Under the gold standard, each country would provide a pegged exchange rate of their currency for a redeemable amount of gold at some set price. For example, let’s say the price of an ounce of gold is 10 American dollars, while it is 8 French francs. Therefore, $10 USD and 8 French francs are equivalent. To engage in international trade, countries would therefore either use the gold itself or gold-pegged currency (so that more gold could be free in circulation) for exchange, which under perfect circumstances, is fine. However, in the real world problems occur when countries over or undervalue their currency.

If a country’s currency is overvalued relative to others’ (the pegged price is too high), then their exports will drop because their goods are essentially more expensive. If a currency is undervalued (the pegged price is too low), their exports will be higher because their goods are essentially cheaper.

Knowing this, if a country wants to offset what is effectively a change in price of their exports, they would have to use monetary policy (i.e., change the money supply in their economy) to restore parity. In other words, if your currency is undervalued and therefore your exports are cheaper, a country would need to increase their money supply through an action such as changing the pegged value of their currency to offset this difference.

To explain in plainer English and a bit more simplified, let’s use the earlier example of USD and francs. Let’s say that although $10 USD and 8 francs are pegged as equivalent (because both have been determined by the country to be worth 1 oz of gold), in reality, it should be $10 USD and 12 francs that are equivalent. Therefore, when Americans are buying goods from France, they are effectively receiving a 1/3 discount because they are buying 12 francs worth of goods for the equivalent price of only 8 francs. Americans will then continue to buy French goods, and if the French do not ever change their money supply via their pegged rate, the end result is their country hoarding the world’s gold like they are some dragon.

If it seems far-fetched, this is precisely what happened in history! Despite much of the world relying on the gold standard for international exchange, France refused to change the peg of their undervalued currency, and without any inflation, managed to single handedly suck up more than 1/4 of the entire world’s gold! What are the consequences of every other country suddenly faced with a lot less money in circulation?

[So here is a fairly standard supply and demand graphic for an economy](https://i2.wp.com/laowyatt.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-one-makes-a-recession-happen.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1), and if you’re an economist, the only thing you may not recognize is SRS, which should really say SRAS, but shitty MS paint graphs don’t just make themselves. [Khan economy explains all of these concepts more here](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-long-run-consequences-of-stabilization-policies/fiscal-and-monetary-policy-actions-in-the-short-run/v/fiscal-and-monetary-policy-in-parallel), but I’m going to explain the image as well because my post wasn’t long enough already.

LRAS means long-run aggregate supply and it is vertical because ultimately what an economy can make is bounded by its factors of production, i.e., the amount of labor, land, capital, human skills, etc. These are not ultimately determined by things like the price level or how much money is circulating in an economy.

SRAS means short-run aggregate supply, and it is sloped upwards because economics is self-contradictory, this is the only supply curve that matters, and all those things that I said about the economy not being determined by prices are false because of course firms want to sell more things for more money and [don’t you know the entire field of economics is all irrelevant because of the inevitable heat death of the universe anyway?](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2012/04/economist-meets-physicist/)

AD means aggregate demand, and you can think of it as a measure of the demand for all goods and services in an economy as expressed by the total money spent. When things cost less money, people want to buy more, hence the downwards slope.

Now, when you remove a bunch of money from the economy because ~~the French~~ Ancalagon the Black is hoarding all the gold, one would see a shift in aggregate demand from ADold to ADnew. Nothing has changed with the nature of the long run economy itself, there’s still the same amount of people and things, but because there’s less money circulating, the price level is lower. I.e., there is nothing inherently changed with the overall economy, everything should just cost less. There is one small problem with that though…

PEOPLE HATE TO BE PAID LESS. Good luck trying to explain to someone that actually, they should be fine taking a 5% pay cut because ~~the French~~ Smaug has stolen 10% of your village’s gold, so really, it’s not even a pay cut, but a pay raise. Even though there is nothing inherently wrong with the economy itself (such as say, a rampaging epidemic…), the end result is with employers’ hesitance to lower wages and workers’ (perfectly reasonable!) refusal to accept any lower wages, without enough cash to go around employers have to start firing people.

This was exacerbated by tremendous pressure and laws from the government such as the NIRA to not only minimize paycuts or hold wages constant, but to significantly raise wages. When the inflation rate is -10% like it was for 1932, this is a particularly horrible idea – even if you think there is a large role for the government to play by stepping in and giving people more money directly (which I happen to believe)!

Therefore, not only is there this contraction in employment, but banks will also have less money (i.e. gold) in their reserves, and people start hearing about this, so they start to head to banks to withdraw their money out of a sense of caution, or perhaps they had been laid off and need to use whatever savings they have. More and more people start to do this and suddenly, an otherwise perfectly solvent bank goes bust because it does not have enough cash on hand to give to all of these people at once. Not only that, but all of the layoffs and banks going bust at around the same time causes further panic that results in a vicious cycle of them both happening with greater and greater frequency. The output gap where the economy is currently producing and where it should be producing becomes gargantuan from the mass panic, unemployment, and bank failures (this is the difference between the intersection of ADold &amp; SRAS, and ADnew &amp; SRAS).

This is why the gold standard was so horrible and why the world abandoning it or any other metallic standard to print a bunch more money was essential to recovery. As per /u/integralds [chart](https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Mc7UVjy.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1), even though they were remarkably stable at preserving long run price stability, this came at the cost of regular wild short-run price fluctuations. Those fluctuations caused multiple severe downwards deflationary pressures, which caused multiple recessions and is problematic for all of the aforementioned reasons.

This is also why economists in general are much less worried about inflation relative to deflation. A constant, stable inflationary increase in the money supply regardless of what is happening in the rest of the macroeconomy is THE key lesson learned from the Great Depression, and why it took more than a century and a pandemic for the US to return to comparable levels of unemployment.

It is also why the Federal Reserve is doing a noble job injecting unprecedented money into the American economy at the moment, and more importantly, [the origin for this glorious meme.](https://i0.wp.com/i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/781/373/b1e.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1)"

108.12 trillion in 2015

Technically if you invest in the world production you’d get an annual return of 10.82% per year. It’s a trick question….

Has Economics ever really 'worked'?,"1. By ""revealed preference"" many top private firms (""FAANG"") hire hundreds of PhD economists to help build predictive models of consumer demand, forecasting, creating, running, and analyzing experiments they run, etc. Within this, techniques like Random Utility Models have done a great job of predicting actual demand for various transportation services back in McFadden (1974) (see, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047272774900036](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047272774900036)) and has only been improved upon since.
2. Financial markets put positive value on the services groups like Macroeconomic Advisors provide, which are economic forecasts from structural models of the economy. Many banks also hire economists to create and run internal models to create forecasts, and most rely on mainstream methods.
3. Paul Milgrom, who just run the Nobel prize this year, helps design and predict the value of different auctions (specifically spectrum). Similarly economists have advised Ebay and others on how to improve outcomes from their services, while discouraging undesirable activity.

Overall, for the most part that private markets place effectively zero value on people with a marxist or austrian econ background, while repeatedly mainstream methods and models have shown to provide value to private companies, been priced to add value by the market, and used to drive and improve upon both government and private policies in meaningful ways that improve outcomes for all."
"My dad passed away in July and we've already reported it to social security, but new credit cards are constantly being opened and wracking up a lot of debt. How do I stop this?","It can take up to six months for social security to notify the credit reporting agencies. You can tell them directly that your father has died, which should prevent any additional credit being taken out in his name. Details from https://www.sapling.com/4897424/contact-credit-reporting-agencies-death found via random internet search. 

&gt; Some of the credit card collectors are threatening to recoup the money from my mom's home. How do I make this stop?

Don't talk to debt collectors over the phone. Get their address and hang up. Send them a letter stating that you will accept communication *only* in writing and that all other forms are inconvenient for you. If they keep calling you after receiving a letter, simply say that they have been notified that phone calls are not convenient, that this call is a per-se FDCPA violation, and you are writing down the date and time of this call. Then hang up.

They're lying about being able to recoup the money from your mom's house. This is illegal, but the industry is rife with this behavior because it's a phone call and they aren't likely to get caught. Just get their address and hang up.

When you get written debt collection attempts, send them back a letter along the lines of ""The account was opened on XX date, and the debtor died on YY date. I have notified the original creditor, and they have confirmed that the account was never opened by the debtor. I have attached a copy of the death certificate and bank correspondence for your records. Any collection activity is illegal. Selling the debt is illegal. Cease all collection attempts and ensure that you do not sell it. You are allowed one additional communication via US mail to confirm that you have complied with your legal obligations."" Send this via certified mail, and if they don't stop trying to collect you have a slam-dunk lawsuit against them.

The ones that will ultimately have viable use may not even have been invented yet. Even if they do have use, it is impossible to predict their price movements. Anyone who tells you it is time to buy or it is time to sell is shooting crap. This is not an investment vehicle. It’s a gambling machine that could go either way.

"If worker salaries and total compensation were made public, would worker compensation increase?","&gt;My old econ professor made the claim that one of the reasons (among many others) CEO compensation has skyrocketed compared to worker compensation is due to executive pay essentially being public knowledge, which benefitted CEOs as it reduced information asymmetry and reduced friction, allowing for a more free market system in terms of compensation.

No, this is not particularly correct. I mean, maybe that's a factor in some capacity, but the significant jumps are down to changes in tax laws that changed *how* CEOs get compensated, namely more often in terms of bonuses, stock options, etc. than the outright salary. CEO compensation for the top companies more or less grows with firm size nowadays.

That's why there is a large jump in the mid-90's.

https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/472/images/IZAWOL.34.ga.png

Oddly enough, the law that lead to this actually meant to curb growth in CEO pay. Didn't really work out that way, obviously.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/08/16/bill-clinton-tried-to-limit-executive-pay-heres-why-it-didnt-work/

https://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5616946/the-law-that-failed-to-curb-ceo-pay-thanks-to-biggest-loophole-ever

&gt;My professor said that if we made worker compensation information public, it would also reduce information asymmetry and allow for pay to become subject to a more free market dynamic, which would transfer power and wealth to the workers and increase compensation. 

That's at least sound reasoning. Reducing information asymmetry is, broadly speaking, good.

This paper at least supports this idea:

Then you've got smaller institutions with short positions, shit hidden in derivatives, shit hidden in swaps.

Citadel can not let some bank or family office blow up the price of GME. They have to borrow and sell shares as fast as those shitty institutions are forced to buy to cover, because the price could go supercritical and take Citadel out in the explosion.

What is the current state of Chicago school economics and its influence on the field as a whole?,"Its worth saying there is no ""Chicago School"" anymore after, say, 1990. Its a historical placeholder to refer to a specific line of thinking and group of people, mostly from the University of Chicago, who charted some really influential progress in the field. This is mostly a period of time where Keynesianism-proper lost influence and a lot of people were trying to give better microeconomic foundations to macroeconomics. In the 1970's and 80's the ""freshwater"" versus ""saltwater"" lines of thinking are a good wiki page to read if you want to understand, with the Chicago School being the biggest player in the freshwater thinking.

In the 1990's onward, both sides started taking more from each other and synthesizing into one more clear, quantitative, strong synthesis. This is, by and large, the only kind of economics today. Obviously you can still find some unorthodox thinkers suggesting more wild assertions, but if someone is ""an Economist,"" they don't belong to some school of thought. Most never did anyway except in the macroeconomic space.

So saying Economists are just believing whatever the Chicago School tells them is kind of nonsense. Not just because Economists aren't really dealing in such broad macroeconomic spaces, but because there is no Chicago School and there is no doctrinal way of thinking anymore.

At best I would say the culprit for whatever ""neoliberal bullshit"" is referencing is probably something like the United States' foreign trade and development policy. Stuff like the ""Washington Consensus"" and opening up markets and deregulating as the way forward for countries. A lot of globalization gets blamed on some neoliberal conspiracy or orthodoxy. But thats kind of a separate question I can dive into if you want me to.

P.S.: the ""Chicago School"" is also the group who really applied microeconomics to everything else. Behavioural economics, Law and Economics, etc. I'd even give them Economic History if you think about Cliometrics and the like. I think throwing microeconomic rigor onto every other discipline is really their biggest legacy in economics, and what really continues at the University of Chicago today (whereas ""The Chicago School"" of people does not). On the politics side, Friedman's monetary policy, Becker's crime stuff, Coase/Director/Posner for Law and Econ, and Stigler's Public Choice theory are all kind of old-but-foundational to some modern ideas in their respective government domains."

Is being an economist (Phd level) a dying career,"The American Economic Association aggregates economics jobs [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings). That will give you a sense of what jobs are available, although keep in mind we are in a historic downturn, so they're substantially worse than during normal times. I would encourage you to take a look, but to answer your question, no, people do not think economics is useless. Unemployment rates for PhD economists usually [hover at around 1%](https://www.asanet.org/research-and-publications/research-sociology/trends/unemployment-rate-doctorate-holders-social-and-behavioral-sciences) and salaries are [generally over 100,000](https://www.indeed.com/salaries/phd-economist-Salaries) ( both stats are in the US, not sure about other countries, and the salaries are probably lower than average since they are all 'economist jobs', not just ones that require a PhD).

Huge over-generalization, but the people who say economics is useless are generally not in a position to decide whether or not their organization should hire economists. Economists are still hired at the federal government, colleges/universities, think tanks, non-government organizations, and increasingly at places like Amazon, Spotify, Google, etc. 

None of this means a PhD is a good idea, it very well may not be. It's 5-6 years of your life during which you earn very little money and the job stats I cited have selection bias because if you made it through a PhD program, chances are you would have done well for yourself in the corporate world if you hadn't done the PhD. All I'm saying is that if you make it through a PhD program, you'll probably be *financially* alright."

Do we know when ARKX will be going public? What are you guys entry plans? I have never bought an ETF on IPO before.,"ETFs don't IPO. They are seeded by an initial investor, usually the market maker and then they list on an exchange the next day. 

It's not good to think of it as an IPO either because the concept of pricing an ETF is pretty clear and precise science. Whereas pricing a company that's never been public is more art. In that sense ETFs don't have a ""pop"" on their first day because they've been mispriced.

Most ETFs I would not buy on their first day of listing. This has to do with the fact that there may not be enough shares outstanding. As a result market makers may place the market for the etf at a significant premium to it's fair value. 

Once shares outstanding and volume pickup, premiums and discounts may start to fall more in line with the fair value of the fund."
Why are the markets responding so positively?,"1. Insane amount of global liquidity
2. Lowest yields on debt globally
3. In India's case, lifting of the lockdown which was killing the economy
4. In the short-term, markets are more sentiment-driven than fundamental-driven. You can argue that in end-March, the sentiment was the weakest with lots of doomsday scenarios but incrementally things have been better (central bank activism, some fiscal push, flattening of Italy/NY/Spain numbers implying lower than expected death rates)
5. Everyone in end-March had immediately priced in a wiped out FY21, now some pockets of the economy are showing a better outcome (agri/rural sectors). 
6. Having said all this, it could change overnight if there is another wave of infections globally or big bankruptcies."

Question for Econ majors,"Economics isn't finance. You're not going to learn much about finance, if anything at all. You will learn about macro- and microeconomics.

And yeah, I would argue that economics is a highly useful degree in a ton of fields because learning to be really good at ""analyzing shit"" is incredibly usrful.

Beyond that, economics can teach you a lot about the impact of economic events, policies, etc. and it's fundamentally about human interaction as well, so you might see a lot of the events and how we think and act in a new light.

Nearly 40% of millennials 25 to 37 have at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to just a quarter of baby boomers and 30% of Gen X when they were the same age

The article has it backwards; it's *because* millennials spend much more time in school that they earn less at the same age. The typical millennial entered the job market *at minimum* at age 22, if not older. He/she has much less experience than a baby boomer/Gen X at the same age, and thus a lower wage *initially*.

"Lets talk Gamestop, why all the hate?","Honestly I think there's many reasons, one being that a lot of people think they're smarter than others, another being that people are stubborn. This is especially the case for investors and traders that have been trading for over 5-10 years. 

The reason I mention these two things is because I feel these downvoters have never witnessed an event like this, so it seems utterly ridiculous to them. Some of them also relate fundamentals to GME, which is silly in itself as the price movement is mainly based on supply and demand right now, NOT fundamentals. 

So by being stubborn - they refuse to change their mindset and ""FOMO"" into what I think is something that will only happen once or twice in your lifetime. However these people would rather watch everyone get rich (while maliciously hoping they lose every dollar) than to lose any of their own money in it. 

This stems from them thinking they're smarter than everyone, because they know best. They don't care if Cohen is making game-changing moves, because it's over valued right now (I would agree right now is a dangerous buy). But because they see it as overvalued, they naturally get angry if it flies and their FOMO hits even harder. 

My third reasoning is quite simply, the subs are different. CanadianInvestor is normally a pretty passive sub with boring Canadian investments. This sub promotes safer and more fundamental plays. This is one of the few subs where WSB hasn't penetrated with its slimy retarded tentacles. You'll get downvoted based on the sub as well.

Is Supply and Demand a law that is only valid within our current economic system or is it an actual natural law?,"This is a good question and a rather tricky one. We have to be careful.

Firstly, I think *scarcity* is natural. People always have unmet wants. I'm sure some Anthropologists would question even this, and would say that wants are always conditioned by society. I'm sceptical of that view. In pre-history we had a world without any technology. All across the world people developed technology to do various things, which suggests that unmet wants are universal.

Secondly, *optimization* is not particular to humans. Physical systems often reach some sort of equilibrium which represents an optimum in some sense. Organisms are similar. Slime moulds are often given as an example of that these days. Optimization algorithms have even been created that were inspired by how slime moulds behave.

Does this get us to where we want to go?  Does it show that supply and demand is natural in some sense?  Perhaps, but the sense is not so simple.

Of course, a society doesn't have to have private property or markets. Societies that do can limit what private property and markets apply to. Notice that is two separate conditions. A society may retain private property but ban the trading of it in some cases (e.g. some traditional societies banned nobles from selling their land). Also, a society may retain markets but prevent some things becoming private property (e.g. areas of the sea can't be traded). In those cases scarcity is not dealt with by market interactions. Supply and demand does not apply. Some kind of authority decides on the distribution of scarce resources.

Can we say that if there is private property and markets then supply and demand applies? Yes, but not that any particular form of competition applies. Perfect competition requires a lot more assumptions. Indeed, the normal model of monopolistic competition requires loads of assumptions too. So, we can only say a small number of fairly simple things. For example, that a marginal increase in supply will result in a marginal fall in price if all else is equal. But we can't get to more complex things like zero economic profit or optimal scale."
Can someone explain to a dumb person like me how printing that much money won't increase inflation?,"If the economy were operating at its potential output level, then you would be right. However, in a recession (such as this one), the economy is operating at an output level lower than its potential. This means that there are unused resources in the economy -- things are not operating efficiently.

Monetary policy (manipulating the quantity of money in the economy) is a tool that is used to help correct this. In the case of a recession, increasing the money supply theoretically stimulates the economy, and helps us return to potential output. This happens because in a recession, the velocity of money is lower than usual, so the quantity theory of money (which assumes the velocity of money is constant), doesn't really apply. The quantity theory of money is where economists get the idea that generally, an increase in money supply leads to an increase in the general price level.

Despite a low interest rate, people are still saving, when we want people to be consuming (putting money back into the economy). So money is being stored away as opposed to being circulated (this is what's meant by low velocity of money). 

For example, you can take a look at the stats after the 2008 recession. The Federal Reserve increased the money supply in a similar way, but it didn't result in hyperinflation."

Lost 80k since the pandemic began. I’m down to my last 3k in my checking. Gonna take a break. Don’t know where to start from here.,"First. Focus on you. There’s a reason you widdled your  bankroll down to 3k. Ask yourself why. What were you trying to do? We’re you trying to turn 100 into 100k each option you bout? Did you have realistic expectations? Are you a more effective producer in your field of work or are you playing the markets as a way to get out of your day job? Ask yourself every and all questions that come to mind and answer them truthfully. What’s your X factor? What is it you want ultimately? Do you want the feeling of winning big? Do you even care about the financial reward or is it the reward of being correct? Do you wish to reframe your approach and come back into the market? If this is the case I would encourage you to consider a monthly “allowance” to your brokerage accounts. Put it into shares of companies that you have researched and know more that you know the man in the mirror. Diversify. There’s little diversification in many daytrader’s portfolios. This is a mistake. Stop spending money on shit you don’t need. Don’t eat out, get out of your environment for a bit. Go for daily walks/ runs, construct a routine that serves you. Go do some yoga, go meditate. Do ALL of the shit you wouldn’t normally do, rediscover who you are and what you want in life. What one does with their money and time is a reflection of what you think of yourself ultimately. Elevate yourself, stop smoking/drinking or whatever your vice is for a bit and replace it with something that makes you uncomfortable. Don’t get stuck in the mindset of “I’ve lost 80k” and get rid of the old identity and create your self identity that you want to be. Best of luck. If you need a chit chat, feel free to message. Would be happy to help."

"30 year old resident doctor with $310,000 in student debt just accepted my first real job with $230,000 salary","The most important thing to remember is that you have cashflow but you are not rich. In fact you are very poor. 

Your parents have managed thus far, they'll manage just fine another 5 years. 

$230,000 after maxing out your 401k/403b and taxes should leave you with about: $140,000 take home. 

You've been living on 50,000 pre-tax. 

You also would like to live a little. 

I'd suggest giving yourself a raise in the form of your spendable income being 50,000 take-home and 15k more to live it large. Total: 65k

140,000-65,000= 75,000 that you are not to touch.

You didn't list your loan breakdown so pretending all your loans are at 6.8% and you chucked that full 75000 at them in the form of monthly payments it would take you 4.9 years to pay off your loans.

I think you could be less aggressive once the only loans you have left are at 3.4%. Alternatively you could be far more aggressive. 

As for your other concerns, I would use the 50k post-tax to maintain your lifestyle with a slight boost since it's post-tax now. 

The 15k is a slush fund do with it what you like, below is a suggestion

Year 1's extra 15k can be split into a 5k vacation each year over the next 3 years

Year 2's extra 15k can be downpayment on a nice car that you'd like. (nice NOT stupidly expensive, preferably used)

Year 3's extra 15k can be gift to your parents.

Funny Story About my Trading Bot,"I had one client messaging me telling me the bot I let him test drive did one of the most brilliant programs he ever seen since it caught a technical indicator which caused it to exit an entire position just before the price fell.

Can I see the logs for that period?” then look over the logs and the code and realized there was a repeating loop that just caused it to keep selling until there was nothing left to sell. Then another coding goof caused it to buy again, only a fair bit cheaper. So I wound up getting more funding by pulling a Homer lol"

Why do people think you can only gain 10-20% yearly with trading?,"something a LOT of people on reddit (mainly r/investments and r/stocks that iv seen) say that type of stuff and then talk about warren buffet and people like him. But what they dont take into consideration is managing BILLIONS is waaaay diff than what we on reddit are trading with. Making 100% on 20k is nothing like 100% on 20 billion. Or even 20 million. To find something making those gains with that type of liquidity and market cap is waaay harder when u have millions of dollars to trade with. Its nothing like us starting with a few k to a few hundred k. So citing how hard it is for hedge funds and billionairs to make those returns really means nothing to us in my opinion. Tho at the end of the day from pure statistics MOST of the people who try trading will fails and not beat the market. I mean the market even changes and adjusts. Some ""sure"" methods of making money now will eventually no longer work and the market and traders need to adapt. So yes its obviously possible to make high returns, but it makes sense so many say it isnt because odds are most the people reading that message arent going to be able to."

As the Flippening Approaches...,"Why does absolutely everything have be turned into an us v them saga, especially on Reddit?

It all revolves around people trying to form an identity based on a particular idea, and in this case it's holding eth. This mental state is then shared with other like-minded individuals who are in the echo-chamber, and before long it turns into a quasi tribal mentality based on which crypto-currency you think is best.

Then BTC, or any thing that differs from your prefered tribal norms, becomes the 'enemy', and instead of it being a discussion based sub based on logic, it becomes an emotionally charged argument where the only point is who is better.

These are currencies, not a group you belong too. It bugs me that both BTC and this sub seem to want to argue the virtues of either coin rather than actually discuss without fear of being shot down for not following the group-think.

Is poverty largely due to corruption and authoritarianism?,"&gt;China could hardly be called a developing country, the 2nd highest in GDP, but is pretty [poor](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/distribution-of-population-poverty-thresholds?stackMode=relative). Same with India even [after economic liberalization](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/distribution-of-population-poverty-thresholds?stackMode=relative&amp;country=~IND). Switzerland has a lower GDP than both of these countries [yet poverty is pretty much close to non-existent] (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/distribution-of-population-poverty-thresholds?stackMode=relative&amp;country=~CHE).

It honestly doesn't make much sense to just look at GDP.

China and India are the biggest countries on earth by far (population wise). Switzerland doesn't even make top 100 (101 actually).

If you look at GDP per capita

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita

China and India are much further down the list. 

Or better, purchasing power adjusted GDP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita

India is pretty poor, and China is also poor in a lot of areas, but developing a solid middle class. GDP isn't the same as wealth or income, but it's a reasonable indicator. Basically, it represents what each person, on average, generates for the economy. Do note the warnings about tax havens in the Wikipedia pages.

It's still true that institutions play a large role, Why Nations Fail is a well-liked book that explores this in detail. But it doesn't make much sense to make plain GDP comparisons."

How do you respond to all the hate directed at landlords and real estate investing in general?,"There are a lot of echo-chambery comments here basically saying “those people are all losers who don’t understand how the market works,” “they’re jealous,” etc. I don’t think being dismissive is useful because people in younger generations (millennials and below) do not have nearly as much opportunity to own their own home as their parents; prices are nuts, demand is crazy, supply is low, wages have absolutely not tracked with the growth in home values in most places, and rental prices keep increasing with some municipalities offering few or no protections for tenants. Meanwhile, landlords—like many of the commenters here—are blithely saying crap like “lol who cares they’re just stupid teenagers, just ignore them and watch your bank acct grow!” People who are not teenagers nor lazy/stupid/just jealous/etc are trying their damnedest to save money for a down payment, and they feel desperate because landlords are shrinking an extremely limited supply beyond what their family needs to enrich themselves, thereby forcing prices even further up.

Now, obviously, institutional landlords are responsible for way more of that than individual landlords like yourself, and there are other nuances, too. But a lot of the immediate negativity towards any landlord is genuinely because, in many places, a great deal of young people feel totally locked out of the housing market. Their parents bought their first home at 23 for $100k new, and it would behoove you to be honest that the massive upswing in housing costs in a single generation was NOT also backed up by an increase in prosperity; millennials are the first generation in America to earn less than their parents’ generation despite generally attaining higher education. I think you can and should try to sympathize—they are working harder for less and genuinely may never be able to attain home ownership. That sucks, as many people dream of owning their own home and just don’t have a realistic path to do so. So again, landlords buying up housing stocks above what they and their families actually need, then charging rents that are rising way faster than wages… many renters feel very stuck, and some feel very resentful.

I’m not saying you need to put up with abuse directed towards your person. But dismissing these people as somehow not as good or smart as you is really just out-of-touch and pointlessly cruel. There are real systemic problems underlying the discontent towards landlords that will have wide-ranging impacts on a large portion of the younger generations throughout their lifetimes."

Why did Milton Friedman think that only printing money could cause inflation?,"A real shock to aggregate supply (increasing resource scarcity, as you’d put it), results in a higher price level *only if* the money supply and velocity remain constant.  In other words, inflation need not result from a real shock if the Fed responds with appropriate contractionary monetary policy.  This is why Friedman said “inflation is always and eveywhere a monetary phenominon”:  saying “prices are rising because real output fell” is the same as saying “prices are rising because the money supply didn’t contract enough to balance out the fall in real output”, which is just a fancy way of saying “the Fed is printing too much money”."

This whole bull market, crypto making the mainstream news recently, bitcoins bull run, everything really....

It's all fueled by Ethereum.

Let's not forget where we were a year ago.

The entire market was cold, boring, bearish.

With Ethereum, through Ethereum, the whole crypto scene had a refreshment with ICOs popping up, new ideas, new debates and all that. Excitement. It was all fueled and powered by Ethereum.

Ethereum started its bull run way before Bitcoin. Heck, during this bull run, Bitcoin was being dumped and Ethereum almost reached the flippening.

It woke up the Bitcoin community, causing panic, feuds, forks. After that, the whole crypto-market started to go wild.

It was all Ethereum.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 19/May/2017,"Bits of advice to everyone: 

- Leave trading for the professionals 

I know this is the eth trader sub, but as you know, most of us lose and often times we lose a lot when we trade. Look, you're kidding yourself if you think you can come out ontop versus whales, insider trading, market manipulation bots, and others with hundreds if not thousands of hours poured into learning how to beat everyone else. 

- Stick to your plan: whether you're in for a quick buck or if you really believe in the tech long term

I cannot emphasize this enough. Don't get greedy and especially do not let yourself say ""just $5 more up and I'll withdraw"". This kind of thinking is what leads to gambling addictions and it quickly becomes a downward spiral of chasing gains. They don't last forever. 

- Realize that bull markets distort your reality. 

Most of us are far over-invested. If eth goes to 0, how much will you lose? Even if you tell yourself that you're okay with it, if you saw the amount of cash you're forgoing, I guarantee it will hurt a lot more than we imagine. Now, eth will probably not go to 0, but my point is that what you are willing to lose and what you THINK you are willing to lose is probably different. 

Take a deep breath. Lose the ego, recalibrate your psyche, and lastly, trade and hold responsibly. 

Thanks for another great day, eth trader. :) "
Is a stock market crash like the ones in 1929 and 2008 impending?,"If it was possible to know the stock market would crash, it would have already crashed. 

If I have a stock, and I know for certain the market will crash, then I would sell the stock and either buy it again when it's cheaper or do something else with the money.

Therefore it's not possible to know that the stock market will crash unless you know something that the large portion of investors don't."

Does anyone else use their stock portfolio as their emergency fund instead of leaving it in a savings account?,"no, because I lived through the dot-com bubble. the S&amp;P 500 was flat or negative from about 1999 to 2012. younger investors have no idea what that's like IRL, rather than just numbers on a screen. QQQ had an ~80% drop and needed ~15 years to recover. the last thing you need is a 70% drop at the same time your car needs a head gasket and you have to stay overnight at the hospital. 

emergency funds are more like insurance than investments. you don't expect to see 'growth' on your Geico payments, because you recognize the function is to mitigate risk. this is the function of an emergency fund, to pay the bills in the event of a job loss, major house/car repairs, etc. 

this concept applies to companies, too. companies with no debt, or lower than average debt for their type, are better long-term investments than companies that leverage to the hilt."

Hi everyone. /u/zjz here

Things are tough right now. The platforms that support us are not making life easy on us.

Discord banned our server ""for hatespeech"", which is crap. We used bots to block out naughty words and stuff.

Boomer parents bamboozled - wire fraud at real estate closing.,"I work in real estate. We make every client sign a form about wire fraud before closing. Every reputable attorney and title company I deal with has email footers and/ or documents about this issue.

The scammers compromise the email chain and follow the emails, then send very real looking emails right when people are expecting to get them, but with altered account numbers. It's astonishing to me that we don't yet have a better way to transfer large sums of money, but here we are.

Banks may be able to claw some of it back but I am afraid there are no guarantees and it will likely be a long hard road for them. My condolences."

"Economists of Reddit, is it theoretically possible to lower the cost of living instead of raising minimum wage, is it possible to do both?","Yes or no, depending on what exactly you mean.

If your question is, can we lower the inflation rate by monetary policy, then yes we can. But unfortunately, wage growth will follow and real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) will be unchanged so low-income people won't be better off.

But there is policies we can implement that would lower certain costs for people. The most obvious I can think of relates to housing. If we reduced zoning and other restrictions to building new houses, then more housing units will be built, pushing down prices and making housing more affordable. I'm sure there is policies that could lower costs in other ways as well."

The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,"Very thoughtful research from a non-finance PhD.  

I will just add my thoughts based on +20 years on Wall Street. Getting accurate short data is next to impossible. It makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison. It has gotten to the point that I don't believe anything I read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data. My hunch based on observing the market movements last week is that the shorts are in a very tough spot. Specifically, when RH and TD* suspended share purchases the stock cratered pretty heavily. In the after hours, it shot back up suggesting the demand is real and sustainable. Short of eliminating all purchases, I'm not sure how the shorts escape this burning building.

* Several people have argued that TD did not technically suspend trading of GME shares last Thursday. I'll let the screenshots on reddit speak for themselves although they appear pretty convincing, e.g., simple share purchases requiring speaking with a broker with average wait times over an hour. Regardless, per their own  press release, TD did require those with covered calls (CCs) to speak with a broker to roll the calls forward. This is odd because a CC carries zero risk for the broker but rolling it forward requires MMs to buy more shares to hedge (cf. delta hedging) and is also quite prone to human error when you're quoting pricing over the phone, particularly if spreads are involved. Yeah, I'm jaded but it seems a very weird measure to enact for any other reason than slowing demand."
Why isn’t the US federal government investing in infrastructure to try and stimulate the economy like China is?,"[See Tim Duy's post here for data](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/timduyfedwatch/2020/11/30/monday-morning-note-11-30-20/) on the last stimulus program.

The Covid recession is different in nature from most other kinds of recessions. The fact that people seem to be saving all their stimulus money means that fiscal multipliers are very low right now. But we also should understand that this recession is a policy choice, we're doing it to end the pandemic. 

I also disagree with this mentality that infrastructure projects are something that should be done during recessions. They're not good counter cyclical policy, they take years to get off the ground which is what we saw under the 2009 stimulus.

Much more importantly, if you think an infrastructure project will be a good idea, then you should be doing it regardless of what part of the business cycle we're in. The recession is irrelevant, we shouldn't delay a good idea just for the sake of counter cyclical policy. 

Direct cash transfers are generally better. People have nominal obligations they need to pay off today. [Tim Duy](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/timduyfedwatch/2020/10/22/consumer-spending-brainard/) points out that what's needed right now is government intervention in child care markets otherwise women won't be brought back into the labor force. Child care will be key to promoting an inclusive recovery. [92% of infrastructure jobs would go to men](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/trillion-dollar-infrastructure.pdf) and this is probably a big reason why these ideas get disproportionate attention. 

By far the most effective stimulus will involve covid19 alleviation. The sooner we get vaccines out the sooner it will be safe to return to work.

Edit: I had the wrong link for Tim Duy's take on child care. It's fixed now."
WSJ: No rent was paid in April by nearly a third of American renters,"To me the more shocking part is that ~20% of renters aren’t able to make their rent payment within a week of the due date even in boom times.

If that’s true and this isn’t some blip due to seasonality, that’s a really disturbing look at how stretched thin consumers are. 

Time to buy more puts.

EDIT: Some back of the envelope math: Google tells me there are ~45M renters in the U.S. so 20% late in normal times is about 9M. Bump that up to 33% and 15M, and that's 6M MORE renters overdue from the month before. Yikes.

EDIT 2: On top of what this means as an indicator for personal consumption (~70% of GDP), this is also cash flow that will roll up (or not) into MBS and other commercial real estate CLOs. I’m curious what the implications of that are. Is there minimal impact because the Fed will eat most of those losses through its purchases and various credit facilities? Or will this roil the credit markets if foreign banks &amp; insurance/pension funds start taking losses? Open question - I don't know the answer."
What is your favorite economics paper?,"Boivin et al. (2010), ""How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time?""

Have an interest in monetary policy since undergrad, had to present this paper for a master's class. Was blown away by the concept of monetary policy being so dynamic. Also appreciated what a well written paper it is - starts describing conventional monetary transmission channels econ students would study in undergrad and then elucidates how they would have changed, making it more accessible to students in my opinion. 

I took motivation from this paper for my master's thesis and studied the same in a different aspect. That started the research journey, and now starting a PhD this fall."
Explain to me like I'm 5 - what is going on with the UK?,"We've had several similar posts recently.

All of this comes from the mini budget announced a few days ago. That mini budget launched a series of tax cuts. Those tax cuts were not matched by cuts in spending. As a result, the government must borrow more.

This caused investors to become concerned. Would there be sufficient demand for UK bonds? Would the government have to offer bonds with very large coupons in order to attract investors? Also, why is the government taking this step of [creating fiscal stimulus during a period of high inflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/xmwtxq/uk_is_cutting_tax_while_raising_interest_rates_a/ipwiap4/)?

Perhaps some think that the government will start creating money to fund this tax cut. To do that parliament would have to revoke the independence of the Bank-of-England. That has been suggested, though [I don't think it's very likely](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/xnp610/why_is_uks_new_fiscal_plan_considered_inflationary/ipznme2/).

These concerns have led to the GBP falling and to bond prices falling. The Bank-of-England has intervened in the market for long-dated bonds to ""stabilize"" it. Will that work? We will see what happens over time."

"Danger Zone Part 2 - Shorts are terrified of a $310+ close. Projected price movement for the next few months based on T+21, ever-increasing, and poking harder at the first domino just waiting for it to fall.","I think the price floor is increasing because the short attacks are introducing more shares and diluting the stock.  This reduces their effectiveness.  Every time they introduce a short share into the market, it is a smaller percentage of the total share pool than the previous short share.

This may be why they shorted the ETFs today.  It was a bold and risky move, but further diluting GME with more shares may not have been effective enough due to the dilution of the stock over the months."
Vitalik Buterin makes Forbes 30 under 30 in Finance,"Tangent: I'll just say this. Most people who were successful in their life, throughout human history, in any line of work --engineers, artists, scientists, politicians, businessmen, at the very notable exception of athletes-- met their *real* *major* success between the ages of 40 to 60. In the 20th century it actually moved slightly towards 45-65. 

That's for the majority of ""successful"" people, the bulk of human beings who ever do tremendous achievements in their lifetime. They might not be more then a few % of the whole population, but for these special achievers, that's how it works.

This is important to remember, because being ""successful"" before 30 isn't a norm of success, nor is it cause for concern if you don't. In fact, if you're committed to doing something big in your life, your twenties are typically a time to mature, to hone your skills, to see the world, to learn, to explore, to resolve teenage issues, to become ""the master of your soul, the captain of your fate.""

So, great for Vitalik, and the Zuckerbergs of this world, they're way ahead of the pack. They deserve the praise. But let not that be a judgement passed onto others, including you. And think of what they had to sacrifice to get there; you don't get to be 25 twice, so it's a choice that one has to weigh carefully.

Why did union membership decline so much in the United States?,"Its largely a post-WW2 downhill history followed by a bigger decline in the 70's/80's. The US, culturally, has always been fairly anti-union; but the end of WW2 saw a lot of strikes in union-heavy manufacturing, rising anti-union and anti-communist sentiment in places of power, and the beginnings of globalization (decline in union-heavy industries and rise in lower wage industries, the ability to just pack up and leave if your employees are expensive, increased competitive forces)

(1940's) The [post-WW2 strikes](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/podcasts/best-my-ability-podcast/episode-5-strike-wave) were largely due to wartime no-strike pledges and reduced hours, pay, and benefits ""for the war effort"" that weren't being returned now that it was over. So for that first year after the war all of the unions were striking, and some were succeeding, but they ultimately tilted public opinion towards anti-union due to the scale while businesses began lobbying Congress to make sure it didn't happen again. The result was the creation of right-to-work laws and a ban on certain kinds of strikes via the Taft-Hartley Act.

(1950's) The years after the Taft-Harley Act saw significantly more government investigations into union corruption and racketeering, most notably the McClellan Committee. Capping this period off would be the Landrum-Griffin Act, which required regular secret elections in unions and increased protections for union members from  their unions. It also tried to ban Communist Party members from holding office, but that was ruled unconstitutional. The bogeymen of communism and desegregation helped keep unions from effectively spreading into the South ([see Operation Dixie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dixie)) and left a major region of the country non-unionized. All of this meant the pre-war growth of unions was halted, with union density in the US reaching its peak at 35% in 1954. Once the growth is stopped, its not hard to chip away at the rest. A failure to get unions everywhere in the US meant the barriers to avoid unions were low. You could just pack up and move to Texas if your employees became too expensive or annoying.

(1960's) The 60's were the period of public unions. Manufacturing and farming were on the decline, while state and national government jobs increased rapidly.  The public unions stayed somewhere around 30-40% density, with better density on the local compared to the national. Private unions were dying largely because their industries were dying, while public unions were doing just fine.

(1970's) Massive inflation led to a call for lower taxes, deregulation, and to halt government expansion on such scale. The Fed's response of interest rate hikes also meant the dollar was more valuable, lowering exports/increasing imports at the exact point in time where globalization was really taking hold. Electronics from Japan, automobiles from Germany, clothing from Asia; distance was no longer a problem, the dollar was expensive, and the US union sectors couldn't compete.

(1980's) Businesses moved, or threatened to move, to the South or abroad; and new economic conditions meant employees were more willing to take low-paying jobs, switch to lower-wage industries, or not join unions out of fear of it hurting their job prospects. This resulted in weaker unions, who lost their stranglehold influence on the Democratic Party or whatever Pro-Union Republicans that might have saved them. The most significant capstone happened at the beginning in 1981, with Reagan firing all 11k+ federal air traffic controllers who violated the rule that no federal employee can strike. In doing so, there was a bump in private businesses just firing their striking employees instead of negotiating. While that was always an option, culturally it was uncommon to exercise it.

(In summation) Once they failed to unionize the South and union-heavy industries were on the decline, competitive forces meant unions were losing power. Increased oversight and anti-union sentiment hurt this further. Then those competitive forces were put on overdrive as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates rose, and distance not being an issue meant both that foreign markets could enter and domestic industry could leave (to the South or abroad)."
Stop thinking you have to make a trade when there's no trades.,"Lol. Real talk tho - “stop making trades when there’s no trades to make” is probably the best trading advice there is. Seriously.

How much to invest to live off dividends for the rest of my life?,"Well, to make 1,000 a month, 12,000/year, assuming 4% dividend, you will need 300k invested. If you are 20, that means you need to invest $30k a year for 10 years assuming your portfolio will not appreciate or includes dividend reinvestment.

You will need to invest 2,500 a month to make that goal base on your timeline. So not realistic with the parameters you set."
Why are stocks like CAT considered overvalued if rhey have a 24 PE?,"A ridiculously simple way to think about fair value is what will it return after inflation.

A 24 p/e is the same thing as a 1/24 yield - for every $24 you put in, you get $1 back.

So say you put $100 in.  If CAT profits do not grow, you expect to earn a return of about $4 each year, or 4%.  If inflation is 3% then your real (after inflation) return is 1%.

Hmm seems like a lot of risk to take on for 1%…

Now if CAT profits grow by 3% each year, well now you are making 4% after inflation, assuming they keep growing that much.  If they grow more you make more, if they grow less you make less.  Let’s say they beat average productivity and grow profits 5% per year.   Pretty good but still only a 6% real return for what is probably a 85th percentile likelihood performance.

The question for a value investor (as I define a value investor) is “what do I pay today, what will it grow, how risky is it, and is the return worth the risk of loss of principal?”

I’m not a buyer of CAT because while we can expect it to grow profits at an overall productivity rate, it is a mature business, with substantial competition, and no clear path to growth beyond productivity.  There are also not insignificant risks of competition, boom/bust cycle inefficiencies, etc.  A 1-6% real yield doesn’t seem like my best opportunity to deploy capital for my risk preference."

A lot of responsibilities have been thrown on you at once. Above all, take care of yourself. Get to school, get to work. You do what you can with feeding the animals and taking care of them in your free time. I’d forward the bills to your family. Realistically they know that you can’t pay them and just because hard times hit, doesn’t mean they can drop all of their responsibilities.

Can someone explain why buffet thinks Bitcoin will go to zero?,"If you own all the stocks in the world, you are very wealthy because you own much of the world’s ability to produce goods and services.

Can the United States maintain its number one position or is it doomed to be the second place for the next twenty years?,"If the American economy continues along roughly as normal and the Chinese economy keeps growing at roughly its current growth rate until it converges fairly close to the frontier GDP per capita level, then China will eventually have a larger economy than the United States. China's population is about 4x that of the United States, so surpassing the US in terms of total GDP does not require their GDP per capita to even catch up all that close to the US's GDP per capita level.

Saying anything more than that is hard. On the one hand, Chinese economic growth could stall out before that happens: growth rates depend on a lot of things, including government policies and political institutions. Credibly forecasting such things is probably not possible, however, and if it is, whoever is doing it probably is charging a lot of money for the forecast. On the other hand, the US could do things to affect its economic trajectory. While significantly boosting growth rates when already at the technological frontier is challenging (though, who knows, surprise economy-shaping technological breakthroughs have happened before), the US could simply take in a large number of immigrants and thereby reduce China's advantage in terms of population size (some pundits are explicitly [advocating for this](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/matt-yglesias-tyler-cowen-economics-one-million-americans-e5d298329048)). As in the Chinese case, it probably is also true that there are no credible forecasts of what the US political system will do over the next 20 years or of whether there will be surprise, society reshaping technological breakthroughs over that same time period."

Weeklies vs 30-45 DTE vs LEAPs - or how to pimp out your theta,"The 30-45dte advice seems like a good starting point. You get longer to let trades play out, don't have to manage as much, and especially if your strategy involves early profit taking you can maintain a very high win %.

What to do with 100k my mom left me?,"Oh good God no.  Don't listen to some of these posters saying to ""invest in yourself"".  What will happen is 5 years from now you'll be depressed and desperately wishing you hadn't spent that money.

GameStop Critical Margin Theory,"Very good post u/Scienceisexy 🦍

I agree that critical margin levels are lower than I stated in my previous [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v0zrni/burning_cash/). I just gave conservative estimates to ensure that I'd have a high confidence interval to make that statement, and to compensate for any potential externalities that could affect their margin during a run up.

To further add to the post:

SHFs did profit (temporarily) when they shorted GME down from $400+ to $40 in January, 2021, just like they profited when they shorted it from $300 down since June, 2021, etc.

Here's the thing though:

They didn't really profit, because to actually profit you need to exit the position. SHFs can't exit their positions because if they do, they will start MOASS, so they have no choice but to keep burning through their cash to keep the price suppressed. Whatever 'profits' they made shorting GME at any particular time got wiped out long ago. Every day they burn through their cash to keep GME suppressed, and it's becoming very unsustainable for them, especially when the supply of shares available for them to manipulate the price down is being directly registered by Apes (taken away from brokers)."

Warren Buffett and assertion that he could get a 50% return YOY,I just thought of another advantage. When your fund is that size you can enter and exit a position with far greater ease. This means you can swing trade with a value mindset. An example of this would be to truly understand and master the underlying business structure/plan of 10 stocks. You can then rotate between these 10 wonderful companies depending on their price (assuming they don't move in tandem for some reason). Sell one of the 10 when it is overbought buy back in when it's oversold. This dwells into the realm of the trader but I think it has a value mindset and your goal is to accumulate as many shares as possible of these companies by buying and selling when they're mispriced in whatever direction.

Why is China preventing people from withdrawing?,"Chinese banks are not stopping people from withdrawing money. 4 small village banks in Henan: Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank and New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng; have stopped people from withdrawing money under suspicion that the banks might collapse.

All of them are in the same province and have the same private majority shareholder Henan New Fortune Group. Authorities have accused the company of being run by a local gangster who is using the banks to illegally finance other private investments. Under public pressure, the government has begun reimbursing villagers many of whom held savings accounts there under promise of high interest rates and other benefits.

This reimbursement has been both slow and patchy, while communication about how it will take place has been dismal, creating significant unrest particularly given it concerns many people's life savings."
Why do some people have an issue with Fiat money?,"You are correct. The ""value"" of the dollar is determined by the supply of and demand for dollars, the same way gold's value is determined. 

The one legitimate issue with fiat is that, in theory, a government may have an incentive to de-value a currency to pay for a bunch of spending. This has happened historically. 

But it is not a big deal in a world where you have a trustworthy central bank, and comes with a lot of costs. If you actually cannot change your money supply, you can't create more money to stimulate a weak economy. It also exposes the money supply to the supply of gold, an arbitrary metal."
Tesla market cap is 669b versus Toyota’s 216b. In the long term will these ever reflect actual production and assets?,"I think it's important to realize that the stock market is a secondary market and to distinguish that from the primary market.

The primary market is the initial public offering or the initial offering of stock. The company sells stock and receives money for that stock. The secondary market is all the trading that happens after the stock's initial sale -- so every stock market for the most part. 


The company doesn't *directly* receive any money when stock is traded on the secondary market -- the company only receives money from the initial offering. So while a company has a market cap of $669b, that's not the money it has received directly from investors. (Based on [Tesla's balance sheet](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/balance-sheet/), it has $6b of cash with about $4b coming from stock issuances during 2019. It's doing well and has enough cash and short term assets to service the short-term debt/loans, so that's a good thing.)

While that doesn't directly answer the question of what happens when the stock market value (market cap) and the actual value diverge, I think it's an important fact to understand and you could probably extrapolate a few reasons why and when those divergent values could cause problems."
Chinese Economy - is it Doomed?,"YouTube videos have been calling the collapse of China for many years now, in general because of a Western power fantasy that would really like to see China collapse so it doesn't continue to pose a threat to the current world order. It's also undeniable that both sides are waging a massive and very well funded propaganda campaign against each other where they both claim the other is on the brink of economic collapse. There's a few major issues plaguing the Chinese economy - some are not as bad as you think, and some are much much worse. The Chinese economy is still by far the world's fastest growing major economy, particularly as it does not have the same problems with growth and inflation that the West is experiencing. For example, 5Y credit default swaps on China's sovereign debt are trading only around 75bps (already heightened from war fears) which is slightly higher than Iceland, while Italy is trading around 139bps. To put that into perspective, people think there is roughly a 4% probability that China defaults over the next five years, versus 9% for Italy.

The housing crisis isn't really as bad as you think. There's been a lot of doom and gloom claims that the Chinese economy is propped up by construction, and with that gone it is going to explode. We have seen little evidence of this to date. The assumption was that the banks would implode and credit supply would completely cave - which we saw in the US in 2008 and Japan in 1991. Fortunately, China's banks are all state owned, which meant that the government could just play musical chairs with the debt, reallocating weaker bank assets to stronger banks. To manage the ensuing moral hazard, it has been using its authoritarian system to arrest, fine, fire, or otherwise destroy the people running the weaker banks. The net result is that while it has always claimed this, we are now able to see that China really does have some pretty unique and extra effective ways to deal with these sort of crises.

A lot of problems have actually been solved but is not widely reported in Western media. For example, a lot of YouTube videos talk about ghost cities, but that hasn't really been a thing since 2016. Ordos, the most famous ghost city has blossomed into a major city now. Pudong is now the highly prominent financial district of Shanghai. Chenggong became so overcrowded that it now has its own commuter suburbs within Kunming.

To be clear, some major problems like population decline are pretty real and well-discussed. That being said, every country other than the US is facing significant population decline; and China is not by far the worst. China's efforts to cope with population decline are very unorthodox, and involve practical things like incentives for children or school subsidies, but also very philosophical things like improving the ""holistic quality of life"" or ""common prosperity"" or ""confidence in the success of our country"". The idea that low birthrates are down to nihilistic philosophy is a very Asian concept - and is best exemplified by the South Korean concept of Hell Korea. Modern life is seen as so full of misery, inequality, corruption, and competition - that people have no desire to live in it, let alone to bring a child into the world. 

China's single largest economic risk is actually geopolitical. Having become a crucial lynchpin in the world economy, it is watching the West progressively decouple from it. To Chinese geopolitical hawks, the West is trying to take the economic pain of decoupling very slowly so that when it is fully decoupled it can start attacking China without repercussions. There are those who feel that China cannot afford to wait and let that happen, but needs to threaten / convince the West not to decouple; or otherwise decouple right now so that the West is forced to bear the economic pain all at once."

What is the Fair Market Value of Alaska?,"You'd get 70 billion barrels of oil, the world's 2nd largest coal reserves, and top 10 gold, silver, zinc, and lead deposits. Not counting the fishing industry or lumber, tax revenues, or the intangible values of a northern post for military/trade. I'd put it in the ballpark of $14T, but it's ultimately impossible to determine. [This](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/01/24/what-if-the-united-states-did-sell-alaska/) site says $17T, but it's a pretty hastily thrown together article."
What stocks do you think are the most overvalued right now?,"If we look worldwide, there are ten public auto manufacturers who are profitable. The total market cap between these ten companies is about $1.18 trillion. Here are some quick statistics: Tesla accounts for 56% of the $1.18 trillion market cap for profitable auto manufacturers. However, Tesla accounts for only 2% of the revenue and 5% of the profit.

Let's take a step back and really understand what this means. I like to think in terms of buying the whole business when investing. Assuming I had 700 billion dollars to invest. I could buy tesla for $665 billion or I could buy every other profitable car company for $514 billion.  With Tesla I'm gambling on them raising revenues from their current $18.7 billion to around $184.8 billion. This ten fold increase in revenues is needed to get to a $33 billion profit or a 20 P/E, this is assuming they are able to maintain their most recent years profit margin of 18% which is an insanely generous assumption. Once Tesla hits this number it means it will take twenty years of earnings to recoup my investment since I own the whole company. While the car market may grow, the market will not increase in size ten fold the way Tesla's revenues need to grow. Meaning a lot of those sales will have to be won from the other established manufacturers.

On the other side, I could instead pay $514 billion, $151 billion less than I would pay for Tesla, for the other 9 profitable car companies. In exchange I get $767.8 billion in annual sales and  69.6 billion in annual profits.

Now let's take the two pieces of information together, do you see a clear roadmap for Tesla where they are able to get to $184 billion dollars in annual revenues? How long will it take Tesla to get there? Keep in mind once they get there it's still going to take a long time for Tesla to give you a good return on investment. If it takes ten years for Tesla to get to the point where they get to the $184 billion revenue target, it's probably not a good investment since you won't recoup your cost until well after that point. Additionally, let's assume Tesla can somehow quickly make it to $184 billion in revenues on an 18% profit margin. Why wouldn't I pay less money, $514 billion, to buy every other manufacturer with the knowledge they can get me a $70 billion dollar annual profit immediately compared to Teslas **potential** $33 billion profit? Why would I even take my time gambling with Tesla?

"BIG CHANGES COMING THAT COULD AFFECT OTC ZOMBIE STOCKS: Effective Sept. 28th, many OTC stocks will be moved to a private broker-dealer network called the ""Expert Market"", and YOU the retail investor and general public, WILL NOT have access to prices, data, or trading within this private market.","This is fucked and needs attention. It means if they naked short a company until delisting, there will be no way for the public to verify that the synthetics ever get closed and taxes get paid.

I find the timing of this new expert market ironic given the implementation of the new rule for closing short positions in bankrupt stocks. This market will allow these positions to go unclosed...bet that. Maybe they'll get a fine every now and then for a fraction of the profits made (or taxes unpaid).

There's more people than ever watching the data, they've just invented a new market that we can't get access to.

I guess we'll just have to trust the SEC et al to ensure closure of short positions.

Edit: This is even worse than I initially thought. This Expert Market is a direct work around for the new OTC Rule 15c2-11. The expert market will allow the delisted companies to continue trading, long after the companies no longer exist so that the hedge funds may continue to keep their positions open, using their paper gains as collateral. The expert market proposal was made around the same time period as the OTC Rule 15c2-11 was enacted. The big difference is the Expert Markets won't allow us to monitor and ensured positions are actually closed, and taxes are paid. I don't like doing the SECs job for them, but when I do, I prefer to have access to the data. Even if I can trade them.

Anyway, article itself is pretty clear, I'd say. Bond yields are low and stock markets are high, so investors are looking elsewhere for returns. Low rates make borrowing cheap and thus demand for housing high, which, in combination with low rates is expected to push prices further up (at least in the short run). For institutional investors, in particular pension funds, both mortgages and rentals are interesting investments as usually pension funds have a lot of capital right now, which they only have to pay out in installments in the future. Thus, spending your capital right now on property which is likely to appreciate and can give you rent income over a long period of time is seen as a good investment.


If the buying up continues, we'd likely see a shift from home-owners to rentals. Personally, I find the current hoopla on housing-prices ever increasing slightly naive, but that may be a minority view even amongst commenters here."

As I understand it, these SFTs are fungible like a dollar bill.  So, if you have 100 worth of SFT that you SHORTED, and want to Fail to Deliver rather than buy-in at market value, you can resolve it by utilizing another SFT worth the same amount set for the same delivery date.  The cost one would pay for this ""feature"" would be based on the difference in closing price from one day to the next.  This cost would be much cheaper than a market buy-in, especially when the floor for a security is like $1,420,696,969,420,741.  Seems like a cheap way to can-kick a scary-ass FTD problem (idiosyncratic risk anyone?), rather than buy-in at current market value.

Why don't we tax patents like we tax property?

How does the French government spend 56% of GDP?,"[Per the OECD](http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933534784), in 2015 France spent 43% of its government spending on ""social protection"", which is [basically all forms of transfers](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/gov_glance-2017-94-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/gov_glance-2017-94-en), while the US spent 21%. That accounts for 12 percentage points out of the 20. The US actually spends 1 percentage point more on healthcare and education than France according to the OECD. And like you said, the US spends 1.5pp more on defence. The US also outspends on public order. 

The biggest component of the unexplained 10.5pp is from ""economic affairs"" - that explains ~3pp, and is where France's state-owned enterprises [are included](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/gov_glance-2017-94-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/gov_glance-2017-94-en). The rest is just generally higher spending on all sorts of things (administration, public works, environment, culture).

The data I referred to is from 2015, when the US was actually at [37.7%](https://www.oecd.org/gov/gov-at-a-glance-2017-united-states.pdf) and France at [57%](https://www.oecd.org/gov/gov-at-a-glance-2017-france.pdf), so there is also 0.7pp accounted for in rounding errors :)"

Officially retired at 27,"Congrats. I Fired at 37. Weird feeling sometimes but there is more than enough in the world for a curious mind to enjoy.

I started with taking care of mental health. Now physical health. 

I am intentional with my hobbies and I really enjoy them.

Health insurance is a drag, I pay about double what you do, but it’s necessary.

Last year I picked up a bike with a storage rack. I really enjoy riding to the library, get a handful of groceries etc. Both fun and active. 

I pretty much keep that I’m retired on the DL. I tell people I trade stocks, which I kinda do, but most don’t understand that means I can work no hours a month or 10. 

Good luck in your path"
Do you know any youtube channels focusing on teaching people about economics?,"A lot of major universities post their lecture courses these days, and there are a few podcasts by places such as LSE and SOAS on the apple store which may have some transport economics (especially the latter given their research field). I know City UoL has a lot of graduate courses around commodities and logistics so maybe they have some stuff too. I think places like FT, McKinsey, World Bank, IMF, WEF, and so on also post quite a lot of relevant stuff too which is slanted ‘less formally’ for business people etc."
"Today, I lost my savings and my career","Hi mate. I know how you feel right now. I really really do. I wanna talk to you if i could. Even though i wanna share with you my personal life experience. I hope this will help you: here we go 
Im currently 34 y old, 10 years ago i was appointed as a branch manager in a bank here in my country. Money was a lot, i was young, i had a fiancee since 18 years old, but what i thought would be the most lucky day of my life turned out to be the start of a painful journey. I got addicted to football betting. I started with 10 usd, 100, 1000 10k and so on. One year and a half at that position my life was falling apart, i was 380k usd in dept, money i took from customers account, from fake loans, from fake credit cards. I remember one month i used to gamble 400k a, and earned 400k, i remembered going to watch a movie in the cinema with bets like 40k, and  when the movie finished i knew i earned 100k. But always i owe a lot of money and i had to gamble. Long story short, it was becoming exhausting, i could sleep only 3 hours, i had to work, i had to maintain relationships and so on. So at the end i was like 300k in debt, i did put like 90k on one single bet, i remembered it was Milan vs Cesena which of course i lost. You dont even want to know what did go in my mind those hours, that night. The mext morning i decided to go to the police and say everything, because i couldnt go any further, cause the last money i did took from the vault, during a Saturday. Sooooooo i did 2 years in prison, i was only 26, i lost my fiance while locked in.. a lot of friends, and all of my career, 2 cars and a lot of money. 
But now 5 years after i got out if the prison, i got a very good job as executive, i got a super hot, lovely 27 y old gf. We are expecting a baby. So what i wanted to say, there is always a bright side mate, dont go in depression. Things happen for a reason, as regards my story, im happy i did all of that, cause now i have the life i deserved, i got the people i deserve... hugs pal, sorry for the english... not native. "
"For the first time in history, a majority of Americans believe they will never own a home.",Private equity groups are scooping up EVERYTHING. buying houses is just the tip of the iceberg. Almost across every industry small business are being purchased by private equity groups and it’s literally destroying the average person’s ability to compete in any business setting (or buying/renting homes!)
Real Estate is not passive,"Don’t buy Shitty properties, in Shitty neighborhoods that attract Shitty tenants.

I gut every house I buy. Every house is in the same city. Upper middle class city. Completely renovate it from the get go. A lot of work up front but once you get a tenant in it you’re on auto pilot. 

A brand new home gets rented for more money. Naturally you price the fleas out of the market and don’t deal with bullshit.

Nothing is easy. Do the work up front. Don’t try to be a land lord for cheap. Spend the cash to deal with real properties not dog shit"
/r/thetagang needs a FAQ/wiki so I wrote one,"EDIT: I had to move some a section here to add the wiki link to the main post

I actually hit the character limit and had to split up the post. Here's the rest of the write-up.

### Should I place market orders when trading options?

Only if the options are very liquid and the bid/ask spread is narrow. SPY is an example of excellent liquidity. Others have a spread so wide you could drive a truck through it. You're better off placing a limit order at the spread's mid-price. Often times it will get filled, and if it doesn't you can adjust the price closer to the bid or ask until it does.

### Are there any good books to read?

""Trading Option Greeks"" by Dan Passarelli is an excellent book to read about options theory and trading. It's only 330 pages and covers the basics of options, the Greeks, strategies, volatility and various examples of it in different market conditions. It's a great read.

""Options as a Strategic Investment"" by Lawrence McMillan is also another solid choice, but it's really long (1,000 pages). Might be better as a reference (reading only what you're interested in) rather than reading it completely through.

""Option Volatility and Pricing"" by Sheldon Natenberg is another great book, a little long at over 500 pages, but be forewarned that it goes over the theory in detail and the math may be hard to understand. If more advanced math is impenetrable to you, you probably won't get as much out of it compared to the other books.

### Any parting advice?

As much as theta gang hates to hear it, there are good times to be an options buyer. If you were long deep OTM puts on SPX before the March 2020 crash, you're not reading this because you're too busy sailing on your megayacht that's stuffed to the gills with hookers and blow.

If you think it's an opportune time to buy options, don't be hesitant to do it just because you're a seller most of the time. Sometimes being a buyer is absolutely the right thing to do, and it can pay off way more than selling ever could for a single trade.

Why is Japanese public debt so high? How is it sustainable?,"It’s more complicated than that. Most of Japan’s debt is domestically owned, which is significantly better in fact, Japanese investors own 90% of all of the federal debt (pre Covid). Japan also holds trillions in foreign reserves. All of these increase confidence in the Japanese currency. While it’s prevented japan from imploding, all of this debt has been a massive drag on its economy. Since 1990, japan’s gdp has stagnated. While it’s true that they’re still stable, all of their debt has been severely hampering their economy’s competitiveness and has resulted in other countries starting to overtake them"
Direct Registering Shares (DRS) is the MOASS key handed on a golden platter. Dr T has been preaching this for months with CMKM as an example that exposed phantom shares. ComputerShare is not some shady company. They are the designated transfer agent for 37.4% of the market.,"Copy paste from the start just to reemphasize:

I'm sorry that this might look like a rehashed post since there are **tons** on the subject right now. DRS is too important of a subject to pass up, and some info within this post I haven't really seen in recent posts. So hopefully there's some new stuff here for skeptics. 

I think the CMKM diamond information is really interesting. Haven't seen that posted lately. Fricken 3200x the float of phantom shares. Absolutely ridiculous.

**Key point is it does not matter how much float retail owns. Be it 1x, 5x, 500x, 10000x the float. They can (potentially) continue the game as long as the ""float"" is still available for them to borrow against to continue producing phantom shares. DRS removes that power from them.**

What to do with 5000$ as a teenager in a developing country?,"Just one point about all the answers you are getting

Everybody in this sub will not understand how much 5000€ are worth for a person in a developing country.. that’s because in most European countries it really is not a huge amount of money.. this is why most answers might be on the lines of

“It’s not a life changing amount of money, just enjoy it” or “spend it on yourself” or stuff like that

Truth is, unfortunately people on this sub are too far removed from the reality you live in that giving advice will be very very hard.. my best suggestion would be to invest them in a € or $ based ETF, though I would have no idea if that is available for you in your country… sorry if I can’t help you much"

Planning FATFIRE @ Age 33 with $10M CAD (~8M USD) - This is my story.,"one thing ive noticed is that when fatfirees retire, it is retirement in name only. you've conditioned yourself to grind, and to give that all up is a step change in life. you will need to pick up some kind of hobby when the kids eventually go back to school.  maybe 10M will become 15M or 20M.

i would add that given how real estate has done and that by your own admission you're highly concentrated, it would be worthwhile to divest of some of the assets, crystalize the gains and diversify thereafter. that is my 2c given how i fail to see how real estate maintains the up and up and up status quo with interest rates rising.

It was as clear as the night sky… Saturna expectedly pushed past its ATH to $45M and is on the breaking upwards again.

Then on day 2 we're pushing $30mill mcap, now $45mill. How is this possible? What is going on?

The answer is simple: The community is extremely strong. BSC tokens thrive on energy, hype, marketing and SATURNA has captured that energy perfectly. There's no stopping it now. Momentum is a powerful beast. A record breaking day will turn into a record breaking week and then a record breaking month. All eyes are on SATURNA right now and yours should be too."

What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"The problem is that I don't think people expected hedge funds to go transparently illegal in every way possible. Things like:

2. Buy out CNN, CNBC, Barrons, Stocktwits, Bloomberg and push out shit articles that are clearly false to anyone who browses reddit but seem plausible to those that don't
3. Without telling anyone, restrict trading to retail investors yet allowing hedge funds to trade.
4. Without telling anyone, FORCE PEOPLE TO SELL THEIR STOCKS. Non margin, non leveraged bought with cash stocks.  EToro looking at you.
5. Show how the SEC is a complete joke and has sold out to the hedge funds.

The problem is that people on /r/stocks or /r/investing think that this is AN ISOLATED incident. Hell, this shit could happen to your VTI/VOO IF THEY WANTED TO.

"Daily General Discussion - August 11, 2017","All I can say is I'm glad crypto was not my first exposure to investing.  I've been investing in various markets for over 15 years and have learned a thing or two about money along the way.  Don't take this as an admonishment of trading, but consider it as food for thought for the vast majority of us who are not qualified to engage in such activity.

When reading this sub, it's clear how many folks, who have never bought an asset in their lives, discovered crypto and have become outlandishly greedy for overnight returns of 100%.  Sure, they can happen, but they are the very, very rare exception when it comes to investing.  What you'll learn over time is that if you constantly try to chase those types of returns, you'll eventually lose, and you'll lose big.

I saw someone refer to ETH as boring ""ol' reliable"" on this sub yesterday.  I would characterize something as  ""ol' reliable"" if it turned out 5% per year.  ETH has risen 2380% in one year.  That's not ""ol' reliable""...that's an *incredible* growth-oriented asset, with sound fundamentals (relative to the rest of crypto) and exceptional adoption / network effects.

Unless you really know what you're doing, you're better off holding an asset with sound fundamentals that you can understand (or at least kinda understand in the world of crypto).  For most of us, that means investing in ETH and maybe Bitcoin.  Can you predict what the token of the week will be next week?  I know I can't.

How many of you can actually say that you understand the fundamentals behind some of the projects you are plowing money into, like OMG, NEO, or EOS?  I am not judging those tokens, just using them as examples.  What are their business models?  What are their competitive positioning? Who are their expected users / customers?  What have they developed so far and what are their expected timelines?  I bet many among us piling into these coins cannot answer these questions.

Anyway, you don't have to listen to me.  Keep chasing fast money if you want, but when you stumble (and for most of us, that's a matter of *when*, not *if*), just remember this adage about money:

**Money tends to naturally flow from those who manage it poorly to those who manage it well.**"

Anyone Else Getting Interested?,"&gt;the UK is without a doubt one of the most stable countries in the world and in general a great place to do business.

I think this really isn't true. 1/3rd of export businesses have gone bankrupt since brexit, the conditions here have become really hostile to small enterprises.

Moreover the economist has been writing recently about how there's a severe shortage of lab space for biotech firms and a lot have to move to America just to find places to work.

More than this Brexit isn't done, the long term relationship between the UK and the EU isn't settled and until it is we don't know what the rules will be or what impact that will have on trade. If the city loses financial services passporting or we lose full access to the Lugano convention for instance that could be another devastating blow.

There is also chronic underinvestment and a shortage of housing and commercial real estate which sucks the life out of the economy.

There is a price where UK stocks are cheap but that price is very low, this place is a total basket case at the moment and could be in for a really tough few years, there are very few positive signs, imo everyone is still much too optimisitc."

"Do the thousands of layoffs in the tech industry (ignoring twitter) point to an upcoming recession, existing poor economic conditions, or something else?","They can be considered proxy measures. Here's all we really know: these major companies feel the need to drastically switch strategies from burning cash to grow fast, to battening the hatches and reducing costs as much as possible. That's all we really know by the layoff decisions. 

The reason the companies are doing this is because we are already in a recession, and have super high inflation. The number one goal for the American economy right now is to reduce inflation, and how they'll do that, is by reducing spending power. That is the only real way forward. 

So, federal reserve doing everything it can go lower total spending power, would be reasonable to infer there will be less aggregate demand in the near future. And so companies are focused on cutting costs and being capital efficient.

Another way to look at this, is the cost of capital is going from close to zero to 5 percent. This increases the default yield any business needs to produce to be more attractive than the risk free rate of return. Capital is becoming more scarce. And so must be managed more efficiently. And so, instead of huge RnD teams trying to break out into new market segments, companies are looking to preserve capital, allocate it for known rewards, focus on cash flow, and make less risky bets."

"If 42 million people get evicted after the eviction moratorium expires, what happens to the housing market?","[This report](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/The_Eviction_Crisis_080720.pdf) gives up to 40 million people ""at risk"" of eviction. So I wouldn't be surprised if this is the basis of your 42 million from journalists misreporting on this report. 

I would like to note two problems with this report 

1. Unfortunately there are always lots of people in this country who are housing insecure. One thing that this report doesn't tell us how the numbers have actually changed while speculating (and not ridiculously) on why it is probably worse now. So one part of your answer will be lots of people, 3.6 million households annually between 2010-2016, get evicted every year, so not much change in the dynamics of the housing market (this is a real problem but not in the scope of an answer to your question). 

2. They get that high number by including survey respondents who are ""only"" moderately confident in their ability to pay their rent, so 40 million is likely vastly overinflated versus what we should actually expect in regards to numbers of people who will be evicted in January and through the beginning of next year. 

So, this 40 million number is probably vastly inflated, and, unfortunately, there are already a large number of evictions every year.  

But, anyways, to your question. What could we expect if ~15 million households are evicted in January due to the inability to pay rent, or the back rent that will come due once the moratoriums are over. This ""analysis"" is just the cold hard ""here's what happens in markets"" without taking into account any possible policies or secondary impacts. 

1) We will immediately have ~15 million units available for rent 

1a) A significant proportion of those will no longer really be able to care if you have an eviction (especially if it came in 2020 which really doesn't reflect on anyone) as long as you have a job and are therefore a decent enough credit risk going forward.

1b) Some of the 15 million households may have to combine to make it so that they have enough combined income to be a decent credit risk going forward 

1conclusion) some large portion of the ~15million units will be almost immediately filled by the very same people who were just evicted with massive dislocation relocation costs.  

2) Some portion of the units that saw and eviction will not be immediately back filled. 

2a) rents in these empty evicted apartments will fall due to the ""excess"" quantity supplied of rental units now on the market. 

2ai) as rents fall some of the evicted will now qualify as decent enough credit risks, income vs new lower rent. 

2aii) some people who were not evicted will now start renting them (either they were rooming with other people in a rental, or were living at home, or etc.) 

3) Rents across the board will fall as these new lower rent apartments that saw an eviction create more competition with other rental units that did not see an eviction. 

4) As rents fall that changes the calculation on purchase versus renting across the market which will lead to housing prices to fall to keep in equilibrium at the margin. 


&gt;Would landlords sell their vacant properties rather than pay the mortgage and upkeep and flood the market with homes for sale? 

In the scenario above, rents initially fall, prices initially stay the same. Housing on the margin will leave the rental market and enter the owner market until prices adjust returning to equilibrium between rent vs buy. 

&gt;Or could there be a wave of defaults on investment properties?

There could be and also as those houses enter the for sale market prices would be expected to drop so we may even see people walk away from owner occupied mortgages. It all depends on the scale of price changes. 

But, again, I think the ~15 million households ""at risk"" of eviction is a vast over estimate of what we are going to actually see in January or through the beginning of the next year. I expect we will see rents fall some amount (I am not expecting a large fall outside a few select central cities) and prices will not go up as fast as we otherwise might have expected (the big driver of increasing prices right now is the fall in interest rates).

What are the consequences of a high renter economy such as Germany?,"This is a difficult question to answer.  I hope that /u/HOU_Civil_Econ knows more about it than I do.  I'll mention a few things that may be useful.

As others have said, the difference in home ownership rates between the UK and Germany are not that large (65% vs 51%).  But, as the Statista site also says, home ownership rates in some other European countries are a lot higher.

Home ownership has some labour market disadvantages.  If you own a home in town X and there's a job opening in town Y then what do you do?  Do you sell your house in town X and buy one in town Y?  Or do you rent?  It's a difficult question.  Moving house is expensive.  There are large frictional costs to buying and selling property (e.g. cost of survey, cost of legal services, taxes).  As a result, people who own a home have a large incentive to stay in it.  Even if doing so results in them taking (or keeping) a lower wage job locally rather than moving elsewhere to a higher wage job.  So, home ownership can harm labour market flexibility.

Security of tenure is a tricky issue.  Ownership gives you security of tenure.  That can be useful.  However, types of letting agreement can also give security of tenure.  There can be long-term rental agreements.  As I said elsewhere in this thread, in the long-run it is the tenant who pays for this security of tenure.  The landlord must hedge against the possibility of a bad long-term tenant, that introduces extra costs for the landlord which must be passed on to the tenants.

Some say that home ownership creates better neighbourhoods.  That may be true, but I haven't seen good evidence of it.  It may just be that higher-income neighbourhoods are better neighbourhoods, and that higher-income neighbourhoods tend to be full of owner-occupiers.

Rental versus buying changes the political issues.  Owners of housing have an incentive to prevent development of more housing.  That's true of both owner-occupiers and landlords.  However, landlords are more clearly an interest group.  Renters have an interest in more construction.  I'm sure people have studied this difference, but I haven't read what they've found.

Ownership may be useful for events like the COVID19 lockdowns.  Those who pay rent and lost their jobs were in trouble and needed government help.  Those who owned housing were in less of a sticky situation.

Lastly, this is one thing that makes wealth inequality statistics misleading.  A person who owns an expensive home is not necessarily better off than a person who pays a cheap rent.  High house prices can boost the wealth of sections of society.  That can increase average wealth and reduce wealth inequality.  But, does that actually mean much?  A high house price is not that important if you can't sell to realize the gain.  If all house prices are high then you can't do that."
Is Thomas Sowell's criticism correct ?,"Yes and no.

""Plain"" inequality statistics like the Gini coefficient indeed ignore factors like that. And there is something to be said for that, we know that for example people nowadays go to college more often and marry later, which means that the point at which especially household income is really going up occurs later. Which doesn't have to mean that people earn less money during their lifetime, and is a deliberate trade-off. You go to college instead of working right away to earn more money after all.

*But* economists really don't miss this at all. Economists talk about things like economic mobility and intergenerational mobility to compare groups of people over their lives and how their earnings develop.

Tbh. Wikipedia does an alright job of giving an overview of that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States

Besides that, focusing on broader inequality measures *or* individual developments is kinda missing the point. Inequality isn't low just because income mobility is high or vice versa. It's not an either/or question and both affect each other.

For example, if you're in the lowest income quintile and your income falls, that can make it harder to move up, because it's harder to for example afford to go to college.

Not to mention that just the existence of inequality can have adverse effects on the economy. Doesn't necessarily matter that people move up over time.

So, basically, this is a hollow complaint, you need to look at the specific type of inequality appropriate to answer whatever you want to find out. I'm sure you can always point to some nebulous group who misses this, but economists are generally pretty good at carefully chosing their tools."

[Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is in full force here, finding a single country where the number of underskilled exceeds the overskilled would be quite a sensation given this setup, no matter what reality looks like."

"Is ""Corporate Greed"" a thing that actually exists?","You're right that ""greed"" isn't a quantitative term used in economics texts, but it's also not without a real-world referent. It's just called profit maximization. As Fiona Scott Morton explained on [NPR's Planet Money earlier this year](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1088346603):

&gt;FIONA SCOTT MORTON: The corporate greed piece is - economists don't use that terminology.  
&gt;  
&gt;WOODS: This is Fiona Scott Morton, an economist focused on competition and antitrust at Yale University.  
&gt;  
&gt;SCOTT MORTON: We say that firms are maximizing profit. Now, is that the same thing? Close - it means they're going to take every dollar that they can under the law. Did the profit-maximizing behavior of firms suddenly take a jump up in 2021? I don't have any evidence that that's the case. I haven't seen anyone argue that or model that. It doesn't seem very logical to me.

Instead, Scott Morton suggests there *may* be some tacit collusion (but she doesn't study this directly and has no empirical evidence):

&gt;SCOTT MORTON: In a concentrated market, one firm could announce it's going to raise prices because of inflation. And its rivals might look at that and say, oh, this is a good excuse to raise prices. They're raising prices, so we should match. And we should announce we're raising prices also. We call this tacit collusion. And in a setting like this one, where inflation might be giving firms permission to raise prices and then they follow  
each other, that could cause price increases.

This mechanism is what I see politicians and government administrators like Robert Reich referencing. But Robert Schiller, a highly-regarded economist, penned the following in a [2022 OpEd for the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/opinion/dont-blame-greed-for-inflation.html):

&gt;The public tends to think of inflation as an indicator of a cycle of  greed and inhumanity, as a conspiracy to rob them of their buying power. In reality, the cause is more technical, like an increase in the money  supply or disruptions in the supply chain.

So although profits are at records in certain industries with high demand (we don't hear about the ones that aren't doing well), economists understand that profit maximization hasn't changed -- rather, it's once again about money not able to reach sufficient supplies of goods and services."

The stock market is roughly at the same place it was pre-Covid. Isn't that a huge red flag?,"&gt;How is the stock market not reacting to this?

Why are 'value' stocks tumbling with fed hike of interest rates?,"Value stocks aren't immune to the fed hike, they're just better suited than growth to handle it.

You could argue that tech stocks such as Facebook and Google are approaching value territory. 

While companies like Foot Locker may not actually be value anymore. 

I suggest looking into Financials and Healthcare, as well as a few consumer stocks for other value play, 

But we're approaching the point where many high flying growth stocks may actually end up being the better value play."

"Baby Boomers own the majority of the wealth in the US; what will happen to that wealth as they die? Will it shunt down to Gen X, be distributed more evenly, or something else entirely?","I take it you're referring to something like [this article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millennials-have-just-3-of-us-wealth-boomers-at-their-age-had-21/), which talks about how millennials have a lower share of wealth than previous generations *in percentage terms*. However, in absolute (inflation adjusted) terms, the net worth of millennials has a [similar trajectory to that of previous generations at the same age](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/per_capita_age_real_nw.jpeg).  The primary reason millennials have a lower *percentage* of overall wealth is because people are living longer.  

The parents and grandparents of boomers were far less likely to live into their 60s or 70s. So, back when boomers were young, there were fewer people in the 60+ age range and thus that segment of the population didn't have as large a share of overall wealth.  Additionally, because people didn't live as long, boomers in the 20s and 30s were more likely to have inherited assets from a deceased parent/grandparent. Now that most people live into their 70s, that 60+ segment of the population has a higher percentage of overall wealth and millennials are less likely to have inherited from a parent/grandparent.

Another reason younger people today tend to have a lower net worth in their 20s/30s is because [more people go to college today](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png). That means a 25-year-old today is more likely to have only been working full time for a couple years, while a boomer at 25 was likely to have been working full time for 7 years or more. The 25-year-old college grad today also probably has student loan debt, which boomers usually didn't have, even if they went to college. That is to say, younger people today enter the workforce later and are more likely to be starting off with student loan debt. But that doesn't mean that, in the long run, they will be worse off than boomers were.  Over the course of their life, a typical college grad earns [$1 million more](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160718_cea_student_debt.pdf) than someone without a degree. 

None of this directly answers your question of what happens to boomers' wealth when they die. That's because there's not a clear cut economist's answer to what happens to someone's wealth when they die. If they die intestate, the wealth goes where ever the law says it goes, and that varies by state.  If they have a will, the wealth goes where ever the person who died willed for it to go. Usually, the estate goes to family, but it could also go to charity or just about anywhere else.  

Some of the non-approved comments suggest that estates get taxed away when a person dies. At the federal level at least, that's rarely true. Under federal law, an estate isn't taxed unless it's over $11.7 million, meaning someone would have to be in the top 1% before their estate would be taxed. If they're married, they can give the entire estate to their spouse tax free, and when the spouse dies they can combine the exemptions, meaning the estate wouldn't be taxed unless it's over $23.4 million.  Needless to say, that doesn't happen very often."

\+10% or more would be more than 327.459

\+5-10% would be between 312.5745 and 327.459

\+0-5% would be between 297.69 and 312.5745

\-0-5% would be between 282.8055 and 297.69

\-5-10% would be between 267.921 and 282.8055

\-10% or more would be less than 267.921"
Interactive Brokers’ chairman Peterffy: “I would like to point out that we have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system”,"From what he’s saying, the GME 1000+ concept was not wrong. It *should* have happened, with devastating consequences for the short holders and their backers. I’ve never held GME but this whole saga is fascinating."
Are millenials/gen-z actually better or worse off financially than boomers/gen-x?,"&gt; Student loans are higher it sounds like

The college wage premium has grown more quickly then the cost of college. While they paid less for college the value of a degree has grown so much that it would still be better value to go today based on the returns from that degree.

&gt; and the cost of necessities (Healthcare and housing) have gone up

Healthcare, sure. Much like education [its easy](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.20.5.11) to make the argument that advances in healthcare are worth it even with the increase in cost. Today you live longer and have reasonable health status for a greater proportion of that life expectancy then previous generations did.

Housing is another area where its complicated. If you are buying a new single-family home today vs 1960 the price is approximately the same when controlling for area and thats without considering quality effects (such as you don't have asbestos everywhere, you actually have an AC etc).

Things like clothing, electronics etc have fallen in price while quality has increased substantially.

&gt; I keep seeing/hearing valid arguments for both sides.

Its highly politicalized and sufficiently subjective that its really easy to make the data fit nearly any argument you want to make. While we can talk about quality its usually impossible to measure and how that impacts utility will be intensely personal.

A TV today might as well be a totally different device then it was in previous generations thanks to the addition of streaming content. How could we measure the improvement in leisure time this affords someone? Since people are buying larger TV's today how can we compare the prices of a TV today then in years past given even the dimensions are not the same?

What is worse off? What goods do you want to bias for in your idealized basket? How do you want to account for changes in preferences (EG household size, urban preference etc for housing) between generations? How should we account for goods that exist today but didn't exist in the past? How do we measure quality?"
"Axis Bank has suddenly decided to raise its charges and minimum balance requirements to preposterous levels, what other bank do you suggest?",If you don't visit bank branches that often than I guess SBI/Bank Of Baroda would do. Opening up an account with those can be a difficult task but once its opened up you are good to go. Only problem occurs when there's some urgency to visit branch and you witness some of the worst moments of your life. Charges are reasonable imo.
Should I get paid in USD or EUR?,"You spend in Euros, so you should ask to be paid in Euros. If not, you are structurally exposed to currency fluctuations and FX risk. It could be in your favor or it could be against, but you have absolutely no idea what's going to happen with USD:EUR (as anyone else). Regardless, it is a risk that is stupid taking because it has almost 0 upside."
"Would boycotting companies who use child labor or other inhumane businesses practices help the employees be treated better, or would it just lead to them being unemployed and even worse off?","Paul Krugman has written some interesting articles on the issue. You're exactly right: by boycotting, say garments from Bangladesh, all you're likely doing is pushing Bangladesh further into poverty. The only way these countries can offset their low productivity is through low wages. Bad working conditions are better than no work and famine. Link to Krugman's article on this:

When will Questrade deliver a mobile app we deserve?,"I have both Qtrade and Questrade and like them both and use them for different types of investing, my #1 complaint regarding Questrade is reliability. I think they should slow down and tighten things up first (not disagreeing with your desire for a native app, but in my opinion Questrade just tries to do too much at the same time and perhaps this is the time to just take a tiny step back and clean things up). Below are my 2cents:

* I want it to login and stay logged in and not just quit on me whenever it wanted to. If you look at Qtrade iOS App it will look very rudimentary and maybe even the web wrap you mentioned, but boy does it work reliably and allow me to do most of what I need to do on the phone.
* For some reason Questrade not only has WebApp but also has a desktop native platform called IQ, I mean its spiffy looking but what's the point if the WebApp which most use is spotty and just haphazard. Now Qtrade on the other hand has a WebApp that may not look pretty but it is a gold mine of reliability (for the most part except for the COVID/GME bonanza days which I am cutting slack for Questrade too).
* I think simplicity with  wide resources is the key when it comes to investing and money, don't dumb it down too much but I don't want you to give me a airplane cockpit, if that's what I need then I would go to IBKR. You hear me Questrade?

ThankYou!"
Don’t let FOMO ruin months(or years) of gains.,"Yeah. Don’t buy options here. Or sell them. The IV is high for a fucking reason.

Instead, buy GME shares.

This is about as solid a thesis I have ever seen. Seriously, it’s like a perfect confluence of factors that only comes along once in a blue moon. The shorts really have no way out. Well scratch that, they have one, get GME to issue shares. Which is ultimately extremely bullish long term as it would essentially wipe out all existing debt and fully fund their transition to e-commerce.

I understand being risk adverse, but seriously read the DD, it’s so fucking solid. I would feel worse not having some skin in the game than I would being wrong. Don’t YOLO obviously but some exposure can’t hurt."
"Could billionaires eventually team up and legally ""buy"" countries to run them?","Historically it has actually been done before where billionaires use money to take over countries, but not with any kind of legality and not with any kind of subtle measures like private debt. Instead, they just directly paid or otherwise lobbied governments to intervene on their behalf, or just hired mercenaries to get it done. 

The US government has historically been the largest perpetrator. In 1893, American businessmen hired mercenaries to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii and then lobbied the US government to send the US Marines to prevent the Hawaiian people from reinstating the Queen. In 1954, the United Fruit Company (which is now Dole) convinced the CIA to sponsor a coup in Guatemala to protect their banana plantations."

"How much will the price of Litecoin move by Monday, May 10th?","Has been a bit more talk about ltc lately. For long it has been in complete shade of btc eth ada xrp vet dot bnb uni and the ones I forgot just now, oh doge. Point is ltc has been neglected for quite long. It has kept some position, still fast transactions and lower fees; and this without the amount of exposure of the others. Indeed other coins contest what ltc can offer, but diversity, in my eyes, is a good thing. And being one of the first coins does in my mind also hold some value. I need to get up to date with ltc projects. This is how I can get a more solid feeling of the value. Exposure is one thing (doge) real projects (eth, ada) is another thing. Combination of those two is a hodl/long I would be interested in. I need to get up to date with ltc again."

Why has the US gdp been falling despite job growth?,"Marketplace last night had a good segment on this. The economy is shifting from products that we bought during the pandemic back to services. This shift complicates already strained supply lines as well. So if you’re making or selling products, things might be pretty bad. If you’re in the service sector, things (jobs) are booming more than you can handle. It would average out to a small GDP gain, except retailers had excess inventory they had to unload. That was enough to tip GDP into a small decrease. 

The take away should be “Some things in this economy are great. Some things are terrible. It all averages out to ‘meh’”

How is USD strengthening against Euro when inflation in US is higher than in Eurozone?,"There are multiple reasons.

The USD is considered as a safe heaven and currently the recession concerns encourage people to move their money to safe heavens.

The second reason is the monetary policies inplemented by central banks. There are 3 main monetary policies which are used currently: interest rate decisions, forward guidance, quantitative easing/tightening.

The FED increased it's interest rates to 1.75% and is expected to increase it by 100 bps in the next meeting. Meanwhile the ECB have not changed their interest rates and it's currently on 0%. These decisions have a stronger affect on short term interest rates. 

The FED's forward guidance is much more hawkish. They expect several rate hikes this year. At the same time the ECB acts dovish and only expects smaller rate hikes like the 25 bps in july. And the forex markets are pricing in future rates so it's understandable that they are acting accordingly.

The FED also started it's quantitative tightening program meanwhile the ECB just continued quantitative easing. This has mainly an effect on long term interest rates due to the bond purchases/sell-offs. A shrinking balance sheet can also reduce the money supply which would fourther appreciate the USD."

What was your biggest investment mistake?,"Mistakes young investors make | As someone who has gone through the ups and downs of investing, when looking back, I cannot believe how reckless I was. I made all the mistakes you could think of.

Here are some. If you are doing them right now, it is time to stop or reconsider. Trust me about this.

1. Keep on finding the magic indicator | There is none, only a display of randomness masked behind fancy names such as MACD or RSI. You can use them as points of reference, but when it comes to investing, they won’t do you any good.
2. Follow the markets like an addict | Ask yourself how many hours per day do you spend in front of the screen watching certain stocks go up and down. It is no doubt exciting. But think about it, what good does that do to your health and portfolio. Chances are, it lures you into making bad trades. You click the buy and sell button just for the sake of trading. This is not needed as all the information is reflected in the price. You can see them when the market is closed.
3. Trade for the sake of trading | I know this is a cliche, but investing is 10% selecting and 90% waiting. Unlike other occupations that require you to constantly working, investing demands from you your patience. If you can find a way not to buy and sell for no reason, that is already a massive leap. By doing nothing, you are allowing your capital to work and grow. By doing something, you are preventing them from operating.
4. Predict the future | There is nothing wrong with trying to be the next Market Wizard, it is just more amusing than productive. I could try to guess which way the market will move tomorrow, how much the SP500 will be in 12 months time or what price Apple will be trading at in a decade. But the truth is, it does not care about your prediction. The market is irrational and emotionless.
5. Not reading | How does reading help? Well, to be a rational investor, knowledge is essential. By reading, you can learn and minimise your mistake. It gives you great comfort knowing that the SP500 has gone through two bubbles in the last 20 years and rose back up again. It reinforces your belief in long term investing, knowing that businesses that produce real goods and services will outlast any stock hype.

I could go on, but five is enough and I will write more in another day. Those were my mistakes and right now, I am trying not to repeat them. Thanks to giants such as Bogle, Buffett and Malkiel.

I cannot persuade you to stop trading, speculating or gambling in the market. But I am sure that there is always a place for long term investors and the wisdom of true investing."

There is absolutely no way this was a glitch or a mistake. Someone at the CFTC decided to say fuck it and post this data. They wouldn't give me anything substantial from my request let alone post the damn stuff publicly randomly.

**edit** this could also just be that whatever updates they were doing, finished ahead of schedule, it wasn't supposed to be back live until next year, keep your eyes out because if they finished early we should gain access retroactively to all the swaps from this year that were never posted

**edit 2** if the swaps become retroactively available, each swap has a unique number similar to the CUSIP for securities, which allows them to be tracked and book kept. The specific type of swap we are all seeking are the variance swap and TRSFBs. If they don't become retroactively available the update isn't finished and this is the CFTC gone rogue.

The thing that initially attracted me to the strategy though was someone saying ""hey, you're buying 100 shares anyway, why not get paid to buy them?"" because that's all a CSP is, is a limit-buy that you're paid up front to place and then the slow realization that I can also get paid to _not_ sell them, or if I do sell them, sell them at a price I want - again, a limit-sell with a price up front.

That's really attractive for someone with happy hands like me. I see a new stock and I get all excited about it, and inevitably I have to sell some of my old position to buy it... with thetagang I get weekly ""dividends"" out of my stock that I can use to reinvest either in more theta plays, or whatever this week's meme stock is."
Do you believe over-accreditation is a problem in the United States?,"By in large, [college is still a good investment for the average person](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf). In fact, we have [evidence](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19053.pdf) that the college wage premia is actually *increasing* over time and that the growth in demand for college educated graduates has been outpacing the supply. I'll use the United States as an example, but this should apply to any country. By artificially limiting the number of students you make your workforce less competitive and less productive and probably drive companies to hire more qualified foreign workers. 

As for supply creating demand, I do not think that this is what is happening. The [fastest growing sectors in the US](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/industries-fast-grow-decline-employment.htm) tend to be ones that require a degree. The most rapidly declining sectors tend to be manufacturing ones, which traditionally have not required a degree. It seems more likely that people are reacting to a job market that is increasingly requiring a college degree and are responding by going to college."
“The definition of “rich” is having passive income greater than your burn.”,"&gt;I have a number of friends who earn between $1 million and $3 million, with several children in Manhattan private schools, an ex-wife, a home in the Hamptons, and a lifestyle fitting of a master of the universe.

"Who decides stock prices? (because ""supply and demand"" isn't a conscious entity who can mentally make a decision or manually press a button to change the listed price of something)","In the stock market, people with the stock and willing to sell it set an **asking price**. If someone wants to buy some stock at the lowest asking price of anyone in the market, they can. People looking to buy a stock set a **bidding price**. If someone wants to sell some stock for a highest bidding price, they can. The price of every transaction is recorded and the price of the **last** transaction is what you see when you see a stocks price (or if you are looking during the day, this may be delayed 15 minutes or whatever the policy is to restrict day trading). If you are trading stocks, you see three prices, ""bid"", ""ask"", and ""last"". So the price is different if you want to buy or sell. And if you want to buy (or sell) a lot, you might have to find multiple people who have different asking (or bidding) prices to complete your order. The stock's **spread** is the difference between the bid and ask. Spread is lower on stocks with more sales volume."

"Daily General Discussion - June 26, 2017","Aaaand, we're seeing the difference between investing and speculation.

Can't believe the number of posts we're seeing that are saying, ""we'll shoot up in..."" (some very ambitious time frame.)

Also, ""we have support at...""  No.  We don't.  Those buy orders will get pulled with a strong price movement.

HODLers?  I salute you. And as I have pointed out many, many times, you're going to outperform the vast majority of traders.  Live your life, sleep, wake, check on this thing 2 years from now.  I'd say you have a great chance of being very happy.

But we've got this weird hybrid of people who have the optimism of HODLers, but who want to trade.  They want to time the market.  They want to identify entry and exit points... but they want to do it with a blind, optimistic cheerleading outlook.

So, to evaluate some of the things I've seen here recently:

1.  ""This is a selloff in the whole sector.  ETH is dropping faster because it ran up faster.""  BINGO.  Yes.  This.  But bubbles don't just apply to individual choices.  They apply to entire sectors, too.  Can't remember the exact number, but when dot com crashed, Amazon was something like... what $10?  IDK.  whatever it was, it wasn't much. So, even if you have something worthwhile, a sector crash can still take all your money.

2.  ""We have support at...""  No.  We don't.  This fall could stop at what I originally thought:  somewhere between $220 and 250.  If so, this is probably not the greatest time to sell.  Your upside delta is too small.  But this fall could also stop at $120 or $100 or $80.  YOU DON'T KNOW.  All you know right now is that we're in a downtrend.  

3.  ""$200?  Okay, I can see that.  But don't be ridiculous.  We're not going back to $80.""  Personally, I don't find that to be exceptionally likely.  However, I don't think it's impossible.  Guessing the bottom at this point is pointless.  It'll be whatever it is.  But right now, if you want to trade, play the trend.  Look at the charts. What's the trend?  Yes, a few folks are going to get lucky and buy at... IDK... $233, and that'll be the absolute bottom and they'll say that they had a method for figuring it out and they'll think they're geniuses.  Idiots like that will lose all their money eventually, just like the dipshits who go to vegas and come home on every trip claiming they won money every time.  Yep.  That's how those casinos get built:  because somebody with a high school math education can beat the odds consistently using intuition and guessing.

4.  ""ETH is cheap at... ""  These statements absolutely kill me because it shows a fundamental lack of understanding, not just of how markets work, but of what a market is.  Prices in a market are a consensus valuation.  Higher volume means a more valid consensus.  ETH isn't cheap or expensive at ANY price.  At $420 it wasn't expensive.  At $10 it wasn't cheap.  

At those moments in time, that was the market's best guess at a reasonable valuation.  So, no.  It's not cheap now.  It's a price and it's what the market says it should be. Especially in a sector with NO reasonable valuation models, there's no such thing as cheap or expensive.  It just is what it is.  

5.  ""Well, if there's no such thing as expensive or cheap, why were you so sure the price was going to fall?""

I wasn't sure.  I thought I saw a pattern.  40X runup.  What looked like the top, and what looked like the start of a downtrend.  Turns out this time I got lucky.  Just because you can't value something doesn't mean you're not going to have price trends.

6.  ""You're biased because you want the price to fall, because you sold.  / You're spreading FUD.""

These are, absolutely aggravating and infuriating.  If I could make things happen because I WANTED them to happen, all the banksters on Wall Street who got bailed out would be homeless right now.  

This is where you really see the emotional idiocy come out.  First, I brought these issues up WAY before I sold a single ETH.  And then, yes, I exited over time.  I also bought a few times when it looked like I may have been wrong.   (As I have said before, if you want to trade, you need to be looking to beat the herd 51% of the time.  No trader has ever made 100% good trades and if you have never had a stinker, you aren't a real trader.  You just aren't.  You're a fantasy trader who probably doesn't have any actual money to trade with.)

But none of this is about what I WANT.  It's about the market and reacting to it.  What I WANT is for us all to go back to our max position and for this to shoot up to $10,000 Eth.  That's what I want.  

Problem is, it doesn't matter what I want.

Okay, leaving this thing with this word of advice:  As a trader, never marry yourself to anything.  Long position, short position, nothing.  Not just in this, but in anything that's got the ability to be traded.

If you have an old, beat-ass car.  And it's worth $3,000.  Ask yourself, ""If I didn't have the car, but had $3,000, would I buy this car?""

If the answer is no, then sell the ****ing car.  That's just common sense.  But people, for whatever reason, don't do this.

They don't think of the $3,000 and the car as being equivalent.  THEY ARE.

If your parents left you a beat-ass house that's worth $70,000, ask yourself:  ""If I had 70,000, would I buy this beat-ass house with the money?""

No?  Then sell the ****ing house.  

The same goes for ETH.  if you have 1 ETH, and it is worth $260, ask yourself, ""If I had $260, would I use it to buy ETH right now?""

If the answer is no, then sell your ETH.  

""But I bought it at $370"".  Okay. Hell, I started buying at $160, and bought some at $380.  I didn't get ****ing married to it.  I sold it.

Sunk cost is sunk cost.  It's gone.  Don't let that have any part in your current decision.  Doesn't matter if you paid $10,000 for it and it dives to $100.  

If you wouldn't take $100 of your money and buy?  Sell it.  It's gone.  

You're a trader. Traders don't get emotional about this stuff.  They win when they win. They lose when they lose.  If they win 51% of the time, they're doing well.

Best of luck everybody.  I won't be responding to comments on these anymore.  Briefly considered not posting at all, but really, the problem is just a handful of dipshits who piss me off with their abject stupidity.

I wish you all good fortune in this war.

Last note:  I'm not buying at this price.  I want to see a clear trend reversal. And unlike some of the new T/A guys, I don't mean over the course of a few minutes.

The push for everyone to invest...why?,"Well... the only kind of pushing which reaches outside the bubble that everyone who reads /r/UKInvesting is already in is the over-aggressive crypto-hype. Which is quite worrying as its suckering in a lot of naive money into a world they don't understand.

Regular boring investing isn't pushed anywhere near enough, its like a giant secret that's hiding in plain sight. I know dozens of people (probably more than that, but I'm limiting myself to the subset of people I know well enough to know how rich/poor they are are) who have tens of thousands of pounds (and higher) above and beyond any reasonable emergency fund, just sitting in 0.01% Cash ISAs. They literally have no clue what to do next.

You say the word ""investing"" to most non-investors. 10% will think crypto, 90% will think Buy-to-Let.

It's absolutely crazy to me. The UK has very generous tax rules (ISAs), a mature fund management industry, and hardly anyone knows it's there, or how easy it is to get started."
Why are Nordic countries so successful?,"Presuming you mean ""Why do they have such good economic growth despite such a big government?"", a former professor of mine, Stephen Gordon from Université Laval, has a series on optimal taxation which covers that topic. 

The short answer is that [Nordic countries have been better than most at sticking close to what the optimal taxation literature would advocate for](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2007/06/doing-it-by-the.html). They have [moderate corporate taxes](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2005/11/who_pays_corpor.html), [high consumption taxes](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/03/why-the-gst-is-a-good-idea.html), and avoid going too far on income taxation. 

The surprising fact is that it's, overall, a really regressive tax mix. That's because [they do most of their redistribution with spending](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/09/gini.html), not with taxation.

What do 1% people owning 90% of the wealth spend it on? How do they use it?,"The media gives a flawed idea of wealth. Most very rich people don’t have $100 billion sitting in a bank account somewhere. They accumulate wealth through the appreciation of assets. Nowadays, those assets are usually shares of publicly traded companies. Wealthy people can use those shares as collateral to get loans to buy the stuff that they want or they sell off a few shares for pocket money. The reason why they accumulate that much wealth is that they physically can’t spend it. Take Jeff bezos for example. He can’t sell off all his Amazon shares overnight because that will cause the stock price to tank and reduce his wealth. So he needs to periodically sell off shares at a rate that doesn’t impact the stock price."
ETF’s to outperform S&amp;P500 and Dow in 2021.,"I think newer investors should stick to broad market funds till they get their feet wet and see how much volatility they can handle. With that being said, I think FinTech will continue to have strong performance this year and possibly the next few years. I think Covid has paved a way for FinTech companies to grow at a pace that FAANG did at the peak of the bull run. 

I like the idea of IPAY (mobile payments) but hate the expense ratio at .75. A newer fund is TPAY and from my research it invests in the companies creating the infrastructure for mobile payments and it has a .4 expense ratio. Lastly there’s FINX; it has performed well since inception (almost 200% in just under 5 years) but again with an expense ratio of .68 it turns me off."

Why hasn't Haldiram Foods gone public yet?,"There's no legal requirement or natural reason for a business to go public. A business only goes public if:

2. To provide an exit to existing investors
3. It has strong future growth but also large debt burden

"The corporations buying all the houses and renting them back out (Blackrock?), are they doing this on leverage/debt or cash?","First, I'd question your premise. Corporations are not buying ""all the houses.""

[This article lays out some of the numbers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/blackrock-ruining-us-housing-market/619224/):

&gt; The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, BlackRock—largely through its investment in the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes—owns about 80,000. (To clear up a common confusion: The investment firm Blackstone established Invitation Homes, in which BlackRock, a separate investment firm, is now an investor. Don’t yell at me; I didn’t name them.)

&gt; Megacorps such as BlackRock, then, are not removing a large share of the market from individual ownership. Rental-home companies own less than half of one percent of all housing, even in states such as Texas, where they were actively buying up foreclosed properties after the Great Recession. Their recent buying has been small compared with the overall market.

Second, as for where the money comes from, it's pretty simple. Blackrock manages almost $10 trillion in investments from people and institutions who believe that Blackrock has the ability to earn good returns through its stewardship of those investment. A lot of those Blackrock clients are just retirement funds, like pension funds and 401(k)s, including huge governmental pension programs. When you have that much in assets under management, the simple act of investing will affect the market for those investments.

That means Blackrock tends to invest with cash. It doesn't have room for leverage, because its job is to find a place for its $10 trillion, which would be harder if it tried to borrow funds from outside of its own clients, rather than investing their clients' cash.

Third, what Blackrock would to in a sustained housing price downturn: I think they'd be fine. They're diversifying their holdings as part of risk management for their clients/investors. When they back a particular asset class, they're not necessarily saying that the particular asset class will earn the highest return, or even prevent risk of loss. Their purpose is to spread out the investment across multiple investment classes so that they're resilient against localized downturns. 

They can choose to buy and sell to rebalance their clients' portfolios, but the only way that they'd actually be forced to sell a lot at a bad time is if their clients just suddenly terminated their relationships with Blackrock, and wanted to liquidate their investments. Sometimes investment funds see those types of ""run on the bank,"" but if that happens with Blackrock something huge is going on, and we'd have a lot more to worry about than its effect on housing prices."
Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP),"This is a high quality analysis and the kind of thing I like to see on this sub. Your assumptions seem reasonable and your stance seems unbiased.

The only point of contention i have is that i don’t think it’s reasonable to use an 11.7% discount rate when interest rates are near 0 and the expected long term return on the S&amp;P is probably 7-8%. 

In my opinion using a company’s WACC doesn’t make sense - WACC represents the opportunity cost of investment for the business, but the discount rate should reflect the opportunity cost of investment for you."

All The Math Textbook Recommended For AlgoTrading (Request).,"I studied math for over 10+ years, graduated from top-tier target school and work on Wall Street. I can’t believe nobody mentioned Linear Algebra. Real analysis / measure theory is a bit too much and unrelated. Put PDE and functional analysis aside for the moment.

Really, start from linear algebra and make sure you know linear transformation on vector spaces well. Then move on to basic probability theories and then linear regression. Make sure you connect probability theories with linear algebra and know them inside out. - That’s what most people don’t know but key to building up GOOD intuitions.

Then learn about optimization. Know how optimization theories are connected to linear algebra - Duh!! Then you can go into Machine Learning. Welcome!

Or if you want to go to the traditional Q quant area, learn about martingales, brownian motions, change of measures, etc. Connect them to linear spaces when you can!

Plus, learn scientific computing really well. Again, think of them in linear spaces.

"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not.","&gt;Not only is ETH a security

That's interesting, because Gary Gensler [directly contradicts you in this video](https://twitter.com/advaitavedantin/status/1460743621515177986?t=tcGqENbvQrQBhiMzIR5O6Q&amp;s=19). Timestamp: 36minutes

&gt;it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes.

this is a conspiracy theory without any substance or sources.

&gt;Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.

Pretty sure he didn't - source?

&gt;At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.

Has the thought crossed your mind that Ethereum is a decentralized network and thus can't be prosecuted, whereas the prosecuted ICOs had a company behind them which makes it a security and centralized? 

&gt;Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled.

Ahhhh. Now it all makes sense. You're a salty XRP bagholder. I'll clear this up for you: Ripple is a for-profit company that has been continuously selling XRP to investors even after the initial distribution had concluded - Ethereum has a non-profit foundation that sold ETH to investors only once in its entire lifetime. Even if you disagree that this is the reason for the prosecution - Ethereum never defrauded investors, but it sure looks like [Ripple did](https://ambcrypto.com/ripple-guilty-of-fraud-but-not-securities-law-violations-messaris-selkis/).

&gt;Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.

Straight up nonsense. If you run a node you have the complete power over which changes make it into the network. Don't like the changes? Don't update to the new version. This is exactly how Bitcoin works, by the way. The only difference is that Ethereum is rapidly evolving - a smart contract chain has to evolve. I'd like to say that Bitcoin doesn't evolve - but it does, and Bitcoin's core devs write BIPs and code just like Ethereum core devs - see Taproot. Why don't you criticize Bitcoin devs for this as well? The ultimate check on power lies with nodes in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. If you don't like what the devs are coding, code changes yourself and try to win community support. That's how all changes work.

&gt;The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.

The fork happened because a stupid large amount of ETH had fallen into the hands of a hacker. This defeats the entire purpose of Ethereum, especially with the move to PoS on the horizon. The fork happened because the community agreed it should happen - and ran nodes with the corresponding code. This was a one-time event that will never be repeated - in the meantime, plenty of hacks with much more at stake happened and Ethereum didn't fork over it. Entire EIPs were created back when the parity wallet's self-destruct function was called, stranding hundreds of thousands of ETH unaccessible. And we rejected it. Note also that average investors had hugely participated in the DAO - it wasn't just whales deciding over everyone's heads.

&gt;The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.

Already disproven. Nodes have the power, not anyone higher-up. It also wasn't an attempt at decreasing the supply. EIP-1559 was introduced to make gas prices more predictable and to cement ETH as the native gas asset on Ethereum (previously, miners could take off-chain payment for including transactions, but now every miner has to pay the base fee), and it has achieved those goals. Reducing the supply is a beneficial side effect.

&gt;This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.

PoS = PoW without extra steps. In both mechanisms, you put something at stake. In PoW it's computing power, in PoS it's money. Since you can just buy computing power with money, we can abstract the computing power away and use money directly - that's PoS. The amount of ETH that was premined went overwhelmingly into the hands of average investors. Only ~9% of the premined amount went to devs to bootstrap the network. Thanks to the 6 years of PoW inflation and redistribution of ETH, [ETH is currently as well distributed as Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb).  Needless to say, PoS achieves higher economic security as well.

&gt;To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”

One of your sources - a few dumb Bitcoin maxis on twitter that can't even correctly spell Ethereum? Phenomenal sources.

&gt;Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.

This is wrong. EIP-1559 didn't increase gas fees. Gas fees increased because DeFi and the NFT mania coincided with the release of EIP-1559. Increased gas fees are solely a representation of increased blockspace demand. EIP-1559 actually slightly increased the gas limit, and saves people absurd amounts of money due to the predictable costs - no more guessing the gas fee. Without EIP-1559, the situation around gas fees would be much, much worse. And miners actually didn't see a stark decrease in profits because tips still go to them, and the network demand has been insane.

&gt;ETH recent and future design is bad

This is especially ironic. You mention how burning fees is counterproductive for users, but you make no mention of zero-knowledge rollups that *already* enable gasless transactions for users - take dYdX or ImmutableX for example - they both have free transactions and free NFT minting thanks to the incredible technology that are zk rollups: https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48

&gt;ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.
Don’t be fooled.

In conclusion: ETH had a fair start - anyone was able to permissionlessly participate in the presale which was announced months before it went live, whereas Satoshi was mining on his own, waiting 5 days before he sent a letter to his cryptography buddies to announce Bitcoin, and even then he continued mining so much that he owns around 1 million out of 21 million BTC. 

Ethereum is becoming more and more secure thanks to the economic security provided by PoS. No decision can be forked in unless nodes agree with the changes and update to the new version. ETH is intended to provide a neutral ground for anyone to perform any action possible on a Turing-complete smart contract platform with a roadmap that is partly live, enabling instant and gas-less transactions on zero-knowledge rollups that inherit Ethereum's security.

Don't be fooled by salty Ripplers or Bitcoin maxis that see the writing on the wall - Ethereum is an unstoppable force that can't be stopped by anyone, especially not some basement dwelling Bitcoin maxis.

One more point: Notice how much time it takes to disprove bullshit? It's so easy to write a FUD post like this but takes a lot of explaining to debunk. Bitcoin maxis use this tactic and cry ""BUT THE PREMINE!!!"" without ever explaining what the rules were and how it happened. Don't fall for this bullshit."

Which company owns the most land in canada?,"Officially, Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II, as all of the land in Canada is ""crown"" owned and everyone is merely tenants. The next largest are the Inuit in Nunavut. The largest private land owner is likely the Irving Family."
UPI is a great boon for the poor and middle-class Indian alike but it still needs some improvement,"I agree with you that UPI has been a great boon for consumers. However, I think you have missed on major point in analysing why UPI is facing resistance from banks.

The biggest problem in banks adopting the UPI ecosystem wholeheartedly is **lack of financial incentive**. Earlier, banks used to get a small percentage cut of the value of each transaction. They had a reason to build UPI systems and push customers towards it.

Then, the government decided to completely waive off this charge (called MDR or merchant discount rates for UPI transactions) This hit the banks hard since they still have to pay for the infrastructure (think servers/ API maintenance/ compliance  etc) to keep UPI functional but will bleed money doing so. Think about it, why should a bank that aims to generate sustainable profits push UPI to consumers when they will only lose money on it.

Hence, a lot of banks have stopped nudging customers towards UPI (and Rupay cards as well). Third party apps like GPay and PhonePe are able to survive since they have owners with deep pockets. They are accumulating gigantic losses every year. Since other apps can't compete on cashbacks and running long on losses (Unless you are Paytm/Amazon), the UPI market is being cornered by a handful of (mostly foreign VC funded) firms.

In my opinion, the lack of financial incentives is the biggest stumbling block to completely moving away from card instruments. We can't expect banks to run on losses to support UPI infrastructure."
How would privatization of healthcare affect other parts of the economy?,"There’s only one place where private insurance works and that’s Switzerland. It works because it’s heavily regulated by the government.  Which our healthcare used to be. 

Swiss and Dutch residents are required to purchase insurance from private firms in a regulated (but competitive) market. Health-care expenditures are mostly financed through a combination of community-rated premium charges (paid by residents to insurers) as well as payroll taxes. Residents who do not actively purchase insurance are either automatically assigned an insurer (in Switzerland) or charged a penalty (in the Netherlands). The primary role of government in both countries is to manage competition, regulate insurers to ensure universal access regardless of pre-existing conditions, and help define the basic benefits package. The government also provides subsidies for individuals who cannot afford their premiums. However, in order to ensure responsible and sustainable use, cost sharing in the form of co-insurance (mostly in Switzerland) and deductibles (in both) are a common feature of these universal health-care systems.

We can’t get get the government to regulate cell phone costs and pay the most in the world and you think they will regulate healthcare when there’s billions to be made?"

Why does the government bail out banks and not the account holders?,"&gt;If a bank has fucked up so bad, the free market dictates that it should go down.

*If* banks fail on their own accord and the collateral damage is not big enough to bail them out regardless, sure, that's what usually happens.

&gt;Then why doesn’t the government bail out the account holders rather than the incompetent banks?

19F with way too much money- how do I go about finding a financial advisor?,"Find a fiduciary, because by law they will have to act with your best financial interest. Try to find an advisor who uses a flat fee per month. 

Typically a good advisor will assess your situation, review any money related goals you have, and then come up with a longer term plan with how you split up your money. 

Areas they can give you advice for and that the plan could include are life insurance, home/car insurance, 401k/retirement, stock/bond investments, budgeting, tax laws and issues, saving for a house, and more.

That’s an amazing income. You’re doing the right thing by trying to be responsible. At your age at that income, with the correct planning, you can set yourself up for life."

ELI5 request - Michael Burry's inflation issue,"Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon. Burry has been posting Austrian fearmongering.

Most of the inflation Hawks tend to forget that things like a global pandemic and massive unemployment are massively deflationary environments.

"Economist consensus says that inequality is a major problem today, both politically and economically. What are some proposed solutions, is there any consensus?","This is obviously a politically charged question, and you'll get different answer depending on the views of whom you ask, so I'll give you an answer based on the links you've provided. 

So it seems that the poll you've given indicates that technological progression, leading to a greater valuation on higher skilled labor, is the primary cause for economic inequality. In this case, it should be quite uncontroversial to say that the best way to reduce such inequality is to help the unskilled gain new skills that allow them to perform better paying jobs... Through a more equitable education system. As such, the best way to decrease inequality, from the perspective of the igm poll, is to invest in education and provide assistance to those who are attempting to attain one, but lack the means to do so.

How did Elon Musk become the wealthiest person in the world?,"I mean, you seem to understand how this is calculated so you should also be able to understand the why. But I'll entertain.
I can understand how other people touted as ""wealthiest person in the world"" got their wealth, for example:

&gt; Bill Gates gained his wealth because his Windows operating system is the dominant computer operating system

Well, not really. Bill Gates became the wealthiest person in [1992](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/10/05/for-first-time-in-30-years-bill-gates-isnt-the-no-1-or-no-2-richest-person-in-america/?sh=2124d84777e3). In 1992 DOS only owned [22%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24086895_Uneasy_Alliances_The_Spatial_Development_of_Computing_and_Communication_Markets) of the US OS market. While things changed [rapidly](https://www.forbes.com/1997/07/19/imbos.html?sh=1819cbf55615), the lesson is that the value (often) is in the promise, not just the result. Plus, Gates had sold [much of his stake by then](https://qz.com/1054323/bill-gates-will-have-no-microsoft-msft-shares-by-mid-2019-at-his-current-rate/#:~:text=Bill%20Gates'%20Microsoft%20shares&amp;text=Bill%20Gates%20has%20a%20long,1.3%25%2C%20according%20to%20Bloomberg.). Musk owns [17%](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048615/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sells-twitter-takeover#:~:text=Musk%20is%20Tesla's%20biggest%20shareholder,175%20million%20shares%20in%20total.) of Tesla and a lot more in [options](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/04/20/elon-musk-likely-getting-15-billion-in-options-after-teslas-record-quarter/?sh=668450987d18), and owns [47%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) of SpaceX. When you get out matters, and Musk got out at a much higher price. Last, in 1992, MSFT's net income was [708M](https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar96/fh.htm) (equal to 1.5B today), while Tesla's net income was over [8B](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income).



&gt; Jeff Bezos gained his wealth because his e-commerce business is widely used worldwide

Bezos became the wealthiest person in [2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos#:~:text=His%20wealth%20surpassed%20%24100%20billion,net%20worth%20of%20%24112%20billion.), when AMZN had a net income of ~[10B](https://dazeinfo.com/2019/11/06/amazon-net-income-by-year-graphfarm/). Bezos at the time owned [16%](https://money.com/jeff-bezos-net-worth-amazon-2018/). Tesla's numbers really aren't that peculiar.

I don't think it is necessary to elaborate on the others.

&gt; SpaceX products and services are not as widely used as those of Microsoft, Amazon or Google

First, his wealth is (obviously) for both stakes, so that is irrelevant. Second, his stakes are much larger than the billionares from those companies, especially Gates, who owns only a minute stake in MSFT. So how widely used MSFT Second, the promise of the product (and the profits) matter more than just how widely it is used.

&gt; Tesla comprises less than 1% of the market share of automobiles worldwide


They own more than 1% of total car sales [1](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/), [2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200002/international-car-sales-since-1990/#:~:text=Worldwide%20car%20sales%20grew%20to,63.8%20million%20units%20in%202020.). Also, microsoft are likely responsible for a percents in electronics or software sales. Investors aren't considering the car market as a whole, but the EV market, in which Tesla is [big](https://interestingengineering.com/tesla-ev-market-75-percent-market-share#:~:text=The%20company%20is%20also%20dealing,share%20of%2011%2C28%20percent.), especially in the US. If Tesla is able to keep a similar market share as the market increases, that can be very profitable. The size of the market therein is more important than just the share. If the market increases 10x, and Tesla's share halves, they will still make much more profit. Just as a 22% market share of DOS, the booming PC market, and future releases in which investors believed caused Gates to be the wealthiest man. Only with the benefit of hindsight you get to say that in those cases they were actually right and this time you do not believe them.

&gt; Elon Musk's other promises such as Hyperloop have been nothing but hot air

First, this is just an opinion, and others may disagree with you when it comes to future versions of the hyperloop. Second, remember [microsoft's](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t057-s001-microsoft-s-15-biggest-flops-of-all-time/index.html) Kin, Cortana speaker, and Zune? Or [Google's](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-biggest-product-flops-2018-11?r=US&amp;IR=T#14-google-offers-1) Web accelerator, Jaiku, Plus, Lively, Knol, Glasses, and Nexus Q? You are just looking at the successes these companies have had and disregarding their failures. I'm not sure why one failure by Tesla or SpaceX would then disqualify them from being a success.

The point is not, by the way, whether I agree with the valuation. As long as sufficient believe Tesla/SpaceX to be disruptors, the value is warranted. Whether they turn out to be so is irrelevant and ironically not just based on the value of the proposition -- they can turn out to be either lucky or unlucky to."

Clean energy ETFs: ICLN or PBW? And why?,"**There is a a great deal of of Alternative Green energy ETFs to choose from with QCLN, ICLN, PBW, ACES, FAN and TAN.**

**My opinion is PBW over ICLN.**

* **PBW** has had **better short and long term total returns compared to ICLN** with 77% over 13 weeks and 3 year at 71%, 1 year at 235%. **Not concentrated on top 10 holdings at 27% or #1 holding at 3.9%**.  Good mix of 39% midcap and 35% small cap growth companies. PBW uses equal weight index and caps any holding at 4% max. Lower 90 day volume of 995K daily average compared to ICLN at 6.3M but volume still high enough that it's not a trading issue on bid/ask spread costs.  Higher expense ratio of 0.70% PBW compared to 0.46% for ICLN. For a $1,000 investment, annual expenses are $7.00 for PBW and $4.60 for ICLN. But the higher returns on PBW, 235% for 1 year compared to ICLN 147% for 1 year greatly exceeds any difference in expense ratio.  A total yearly return of 1% is equal to 1.0% expense ratio.
* **ICLN** has 10.9% PLUG in ETF, too much overweight with single holding, Top 10 holdings of 50.6% is concentrated. The higher 90 day volume of 6.3M compare to 682K for PBW is not a factor. Great returns of 57% over 13 weeks and 3 year of 48%, 1 year at 147%. **What happen the last 4 weeks with -5.97% return?**

**My ETF selection criteria:**

* First priority is great returns on investment over Long Term of 3 years &amp; 5 years metrics.
* ETF needs upward price momentum over Short Term over 4 weeks and 13 weeks, breaking above 20 day and 50 day moving average.
* High trading volume, greater than 200K 90 day daily average to keep hidden cost down on bid/ask spreads on accumulating shares over time and selling.
* Low expense ratio for ETF.
* ETF has stock diversity with high number of holdings over peer ETFs in same sector and does not have narrow concentrated on top 10 holdings.
* Need to decide whether to go global reach, US only or country specific such as China for ETF.

***Comparison of the 6 green energy ETFs.***

**QCLN, ICLN, PBW, ACES, FAN and TAN.**

**ICLN,** Global Clean energy ETF. high 90 day of 6.3M, expense ratio of 0.46%,  Returns of 48%  3 years, 45% in last 13 weeks, **but minus -5.97% last 4 weeks.** Only 43 holdings, top holding is **10.9% of PLUG** and top 10 is 50.6%.  42% North America, 35% Europe, 10% Asia. In all fields of alternative energy, solar, biofuels, ethanol, hydroelectric, solar, wind.  29% Large cap, **59% midcap**, 10% small cap.

**ICLN final opinion:** 10.9% too much overweight with PLUG, Top 10 holdings of 50.6% is concentrated. What happen the last 4 weeks with -5.97% return? Best high volume with 90 day at 6.3M shares

**QCLN,** Nasdaq Clean green energy index, 767K 90 day volume, expense ratio of 0.60%, returns of 57% over 13 weeks and 3 year of 58%. 45 holdings Top 10 at 54%, 8.8% Tesla and 7.5% PLUG. 84% US, 10% China, 5% Canada.  QCLN holds a market cap weight index of US firms in clean energy. Its a broad portfolio of US-listed firms in the clean energy industry. Advanced materials (that enable clean-energy or reduce the need for petroleum products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).  18% large cap, **57% midcap**, 24% small cap.

**QCLN final opinion:** Top 10 concentrated at 54%, 8.8% Tesla and 7.5% PLUG is highly concentrated. Great returns. Good 90 day volume at 996K. High returns.

**PBW,** Invesco Wilderhill Clean Energy ETF, 90 day volume at 682K , 0.7% expense ratio, 3 year returns of 71%, 13 weeks 77%, 58 holdings, **Top 10 holdings is great at 27%.** Top holding of ReneSola at 3.9%.  **PBW uses equal weight index versus market cap weight and this avoids concentration of holdings. Caps any holding at 4% max.** PBW is highly diverse in scope, reaching beyond just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, biofuels and geothermal companies, to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy.  Only holds listed US companies.  68% US, 15% China, 11% Canada. 12% large cap, **39% midcap and 35% small cap.**

**PBW final opinion:** Checks all criteria, good 90 day volume, great returns 13 weeks at 77% and 3 year at 71%. Not concentrated on top 10 holdings or #1 holding.  Good mix of midcap and small cap growth companies.

**ACES,** ALPS Clean energy ETF, 90 day volume at 148K daily, lower to ETF peers. Expense ratio 0.55%, New green ETF with inception date of 6/27/18.  Returns 155% year and 59% 13 weeks. Top ten holdings 52% with PLUG at 9.6%. 100% North America, 82% USA and 18% Canada.  ACES tracks a market-cap-weighted index of North American companies involved in the clean energy.  The index provider targets companies in activities such as renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydropower, biofuels), clean technologies (electric vehicles, battery technology, fuel cells, smart grids), and any other emerging clean energy technology. Constituents are market-cap-weighted, subject to a 5% cap on individual stocks. ( Look like ACES will need to sell some of the 9.6% of PLUG on next quarterly rebalance to get down to 5% holding criteria).

**ACES final opinion:**  The 90 day trading volume of 148K is lower than ETF green energy peers, good 1 year and 13 week returns, a new green ETF with inception date of 6/27/18.

**TAN,** Invesco Solar ETF, 1.5M 90 day volume, 0.69% expense ratio, returns of 64% over 3 years, 54% over 13 weeks, -2.1% over past 4 weeks. Only 38 holdings, top 10 at 63%, top #1 holding Enphase Energy is at 10.6%. Too much concentration on top 10 and #1 holding.  46% USA, 26% China. 8% Large cap, 71% midcap, 20% small cap.  Pure global solar energy. If you like solar this is your ETF, but does not include other renewables, biofuels, wind, battery electric vehicles.

**TAN final opinion:** Pure solar ETF. If you like solar energy, then this is your ETF. Narrow focus, doesn't include other renewables or electric vehicles. Too much concentration on top 10 and #1 holding, Great short term and long term returns. Down 2% over past 4 weeks.

**FAN**, First trust Global Wind ETF, pure-play global wind power. Doesn't include other renewables. 90 Day volume lower than peers at 288K, higher cost bid/ask spreads, 0.62% expense ratio, **total returns of 22% 3 years** and 25% for13 weeks **lagging behind green energy peers,** but 60% for 1 year.  55 holdings, but high concentration of top 10 at 58% and Siemens at 8.9%, 51% Europe, 17% Canada, 16% Denmark, 112% Spain, 12% USA.  **62% Large cap**, 26% midcap, 11% small cap.

**FAN final opinion;** If you like wind power energy then this is your ETF. Pure wind power ETF play. No other renewables, too high concentration, lower 90 day volume of 288K compared to peers, total returns lagging behind other green energy peers, but last 1 year at 60% returns.

Today wasn’t a bloodbath for $GME or $AMC. WE watched LITERAL insanity as Hedgies sat and traded their trash BACK and forth to each other in order to cause YOU to panic. HOLD. BUY.,"learned this investment tip from my gay aunt. When you buy Gamestop, dont just stare at your phone all day. evertime i buy a stock, I gently squeeze my phone between my glute cheeks and set my phone to vibrate every time the shares moves. the tingling keeps me grounded and focused on the present moment. I find my mind wandering on painful past memories or future anxiety, but my new meditation mantra gently reminds me to focus on the present moment and remain mindful of all the boof stocks I'm buying. namestay is the way. Also, and this is super serious, if you've never had a prostate orgasm, this method is great at relieving stress and relieving the backlog of prostate milk youve built while holding Gamestop. Your investment is more than a financial revolution, it's spiritual orgasmic sexual revolution. Sure these hedge funds want your money, but they want even more than that. They want to repress your prostate milk. I'm talking pure spiritual energy that's inside all of you. Milk your prostate and release your tendies.  Ladies can also tap into this raw spiritual orgasmic jet fuel by placing the phone on the front of your clitoral hood.

Rocket Companies (RKT) - DD on an Undervalued Gem!,"As someone who works in the real estate industry I really wonder how their stock price will do. Rocket Mortgage PreApprovals aren’t worth the paper they’re written on and will lose a buyer a house in WA state. Listing agents will not take them seriously because they do not look into a clients financials as well as the standard for mortgage brokers.

They have excellent marketing. I tried to use them to buy a house of my own. Terrible experience. If they could change certain things about the company I’d definitely be long, but I know their new purchase business is terrible in hot markets. Refinance may be a different story.
All that to say, they do have great marketing and the IV looks right for puts."

I want to become literate in Economics as a layman: Where and how to start?,"I would read textbooks and avoid YouTube videos as a starting point. 

There are good YouTube channels of course. The problem is that there are also misleading channels and, if you don’t already know economics, it’s hard to tell which are saying correct things and which are saying things that sound correct but are not. 

You may also want to ask for references about specific fields. You need very different books if you want to know how the Fed works, or why some countries are poor, or why some people are poor, or which government interventions may help markets, or why some products are more expensive, or why some firms are more profitable. 

The wiki of this sub has a great reading list."
Could the Economic crisis have been averted by the Federal government giving $2400 per month to all Americans making under 100K from March 2020-December 2021?,"Averted? No. A downturn still would have happened as a result of COVID &amp; pandemic restrictions.

Would it not have been as severe? Yes.

Exactly how much better would the economy have fared? We could debate all day and likely never be sure.

First thing to emphasize: the economy is not money.  Giving a person $2000 is not the same as that person working and getting paid $2000.  Even if the amount of money is the same, what the person does with it will be different.  

The cause of the economic downturn was the abrupt reduction in people doing things. I wanted to watch a movie in a theatre, but the theatre was closed so I stayed home instead. It's not the price of the movie ticket the economy loses, it's the value I place on my experience. I had to trade something I preferred (going to a theatre) with something I valued less (staying home). That's the loss; not the price of the movie ticket. It doesn't matter if the government gave me $2000 or not, with the risk of a communicable disease high I'm avoiding this activity.  It's not driven by monetary restrictions, so providing additional money won't alleviate it.

The above example is a small scale one and almost trivial in nature, but as that happens for multiple people repeatedly it adds up. Maybe my neighbor wanted to take a beach vacation, but instead stayed home and learned how to knit. Someone else wanted to go out for dinner at a restaurant but instead stayed home and cooked. Repeat these tradeoffs over and over and it adds up to the economy (which is us) being at a less desired state than we would have been absent COVID.  

A large part of this compounds because of how these decisions then impacted certain groups of people.  Retail, hospitality, and service workers suddenly faced a massive downturn in their industry. This means their income fell, and as a result they made other choices not directly related to COVID.  A hotel manager decides not to buy a new car not out of fear of a pandemic, but because of reduced income. 

This is where the government transfers can help. Anyone losing their job would otherwise reduce their spending (often drastically), but if they knew there is unemployment insurance available, or (as you ask) a direct transfer payment some of these decisions change and maybe the unemployed person still spends a roughly equivalent amount.

The other thing the payments would do is increase spending from people less effected by the pandemic.  Many people retained their jobs during the pandemic, they'd now have even more disposable income. At least some of this would be spent on things these people otherwise would not have purchased. But here is where determining how much more people will spend starts to matter...  In aggregate, across all people, how much of this money will be spent immediately, and how much will be saved for later?  Spending drives the immediate short-term GDP.  Savings *kind of* becomes investments, and drives long-term GDP.  But... with the fed offering historically low interest rates, the relationship between savings and investment is skewed. With historically low interest rates, financing can facilitate investments without the need for as much savings.

So, we have a picture of opposing influences of varying degrees.  People's behavior changed to avoid the virus. Just giving people cash encourages them to spend more; but still in a manner influenced by pandemic risks."

What's a personal finance tip or hack that should be common knowledge but isn't?,"Whenever you take out a secured loan of any kind, buy a pureplay life insurance cover (called term insurance) of the loan+interest amount for the duration of the loan.

Why are American and Swiss wages so much higher than most countries,"Switzerland, Ireland, Netherlands are all tax havens that benefit from companies moving there to avoid taxes, and partly because its expensive to live there as you stated. 

As for the rest of the European countries, their wages are lower on average because they work a lot less. The average northern/western European works about [400 hours less per year](https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm) than the average American. This is partly because of generous benefits like paid leave, ranging from [three weeks in Germany](https://www.iamexpat.de/career/working-in-germany/sick-holiday-maternity-leave) to up to [FIVE weeks in Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country) (holy shit lol). This isn't including the one year+ maternity and paternity leave, so they get a ton. Many Europeans also opt for thirty two hour work weeks to spread their vacation days around. The money to fund all these benefits has to come from somewhere, and this is usually in the form of lower wages and higher taxes.

The wages in Singapore are low because they import workers from nearby developing nations for cheap labor, which is why their housing is so inexpensive. They also have really high inequality due a lack of redistributive policy and concentrated markets, all of which lower wages."

1 year follow up: Moved from VHCOL to MCOL (and FIREd),"&gt;Read Man’s Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl - ““Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.””

Just read this recently and it helped immensely with my anxiety, which was pretty much just a big existential vacuum (as discussed in the book).  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone and everyone, no matter what point they are in their life.  Some additional quotes that I really like:

&gt;“It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly…Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.”

and

&gt;“‘The self-transcendence of human existence’…being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself…self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.”

and

&gt;“These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. ‘Life’ does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross.""

and

&gt; “Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.”

Fat Dating - Anyone successfully used millionaire matchmaking services to find a wife?,"&gt; At this point, I'm struggling to meet ""quality"" women since I don't work at a company, most of my friends are married, and I only sometimes go to bars to catch up with friends. No clubs or festivals or anything like that.

The reason you're 'struggling' to meet *quality* women is because it doesn't seem like you're actually trying? Bars and clubs are fun places to go with friends, but they're bad places to meet new people, and you'll have better luck meeting new people if you have some sort of shared interest to bond over.

&gt; I do have several hobbies like golf and sports cars, but those haven't been great meeting grounds either.

Yeah... you're not going to meet women golfing or at the track.

&gt; I've tried dating apps like Bumble and Hinge, but at my age, I'm finding it hard to get good matches. I don't like to show off my wealth, and am not very tall or good looking.

How much energy did you put into your profile? Do you have nice clothes and professional pictures? A millionaire matchmaker is going to tell you that you need to spend money on your appearance...

How often do you get to the gym? If you want a partner that stays fit, you need to do the same. You mention you don't think you're attractive. Fine, you can't change that. But you can do a tremendous amount to change your physical appearance with clothing, grooming and training.

I have a lot of friends that just sort of assumed some gorgeous woman would walk into their lives, and pursue them. That's not really how it happens. You need to engage in activities that have a high probability of you meeting new people. Doing very little, and then hiring a professional, is just going to result in that professional giving you the same advice I'm giving you now.

Go out into the world and meet people. Do you like running? Do a couch to 5k program, I guarantee wherever you live, every weekend there are recreational 5k races that you can run in, no one cares how fast you are, and afterwords everyone hangs out high on endorphins. That's a great place to meet people."
"ELI5: &lt;serious&gt; How does a business like Trump's golf courses/hotels that have been losing money for so long continue to be able to make payroll, yet many other businesses that run this kind of debt end up going out of business?","The simple answer for Trump based on recent reporting: loans.

The longer general answer: access to capital.

If a business is unable to pay its bills from its revenue, then the business needs to seek capital from somewhere else. This will typically come in the form of loans, bonds, selling of property, etc. This monetary injection is then used to pay bills until the business can find its footing and get past the rough times. Big businesses tend to have more access to capital and thus have more options at their disposal for navigating turbulent economic water.

You're seeing many businesses fail in covid19 times because nobody wants to give loans to companies in hospitality, tourism, transportation, restaurants, and most service sectors. As a lender, you're looking at projections of potentially 1+ year(s) before those industries can really begin the long process of recovery. Any loan to that kind of business is very likely to go unpaid and be a loss. This is why you see these same industries frequently discussed when it comes to publicly provided stimulus packages because private lenders are unlikely to offer any help here. 

The recent NYT reporting on Trump's tax returns suggest that Trump relies to some degree on private loans to keep his various businesses afloat. There's a cycle of boom, bust, loans, repeat in Trump's financials. To date, Trump has been successful in securing loans as needed to cover his losses long enough to find a new income source."
"What is your target price to buy into GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN?","Should be buying now imho.  Cost average down. Don’t try to catch a falling knife. The moment consumer inflation turns, the fed will pivot. They won’t come close to recouping all the stimmy that’s been fire hosed the last 3 years+.  Government would need to raise taxes/cut spending to do that, and that ain’t happening. That money will land some where and markets will be a big winner. Those companies are doing buybacks too. For example, from last year until some point in the future MSFT has 60B$ allocated to share repurchases. That’s like 3% of outstanding. Considering a large part of the float is locked up in retirement accounts and such, these SP500 giants are going to be on a rocket when the bull runs again.

Of course, there is many different groups that the incidence could fall on: shareholders, workers, customers, lenders, etc.

If we apply a tax to a consumer while buying a product, they can (and likely will) pass a portion of that cost on to the seller ([like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Detailed_tax_wedge.png)), meaning the seller bears part of the incidence of that tax.

I don't see how deflation if bad,"Mild deflation isn't always too bad in of itself, but more on that later.

Sure, your money suddenly being worth 5x more sounds nice. But what if it's worth 5x more than that half a year from now? 10x more in one year? That would be a big incentive to wait, not spend.

Now, mild and stable deflation, or inflation for that matter, doesn't really do much, it gets priced in, interest rates, wages, etc. adapt and it's neither here nor there.

*But* what happens if a recession hits? You have $10 and they will be worth $13 a year from now, but now you're also uncertain if you'll keep your job and income. So you're more conservative with your money. Meaning lower demand, which leads to even worse conditions for businesses, higher borrowing costs, more layoffs, businesses being forced to lower prices to chase the falling demand, which leads to more uncertainty, even lower demand, more deflation, etc.

In short, a [deflationary spiral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflationary-spiral.asp).

So the short answer why we don't aim for deflation is because deflation is harder to get out off if you're already starting with it, leading to a higher risk for such a spiral. Targeting positive inflation makes it much easier to fight recessions."

"Bitcoin price hit its new record high, what is the economic explanation of Bitcoin value?","We could go into a lengthy discussion on the technology and potential uses - but lets not. The answer is really quite simple. It is worth whatever somebody else is willing to pay for it.

&gt; Why does it have value? 

Because some people are willing pay for it.


&gt; Is it all artificial value?


Yes or no, depending on what you mean by it. Yes in the sense that, no, it does not represent anything of 'real' value. No in the sense that in that regard it is not much different from 'real' money. You can't eat dollar bills, and if people tomorrow all of the sudden don't believe dollar bills are going to be valuable anymore, then they aren't. 


The most important thing to understand is that literally *any* value is subjective, and anything could potentially be used as a currency (though in many cases it would be impractical). Money used to represent gold directly, but one could imagine a scenario where gold would become without value as well.


Bitcoin is different in many ways - due to its technology, and its decentralized (uncontrolled) nature, being seperate from a central bank. But the basic intuition remains the same. It has value because people believe it has value.


&gt; Does it have real value for economy?


What do you mean by that?"

The psychology that unfolds is that the potential saviors of the housing market sit on the sidelines waiting for the better deal.   They try to time the dip.   This makes things worse.   Only 5% of the housing market being dumped can dump the market.  
2. We have a new player in town called Basel III.   If a big bank fails now - the negatives on its balance sheet in the form of debt (bonds) is wiped out.   The former debt holders become the new shareholders and the original shareholders are (partially or fully) wiped out.   The idea was to put the risk on the shareholders who 'own' the company.   But this is where market linkages get weird.   Who owns those bonds?   Goldman sold $12B of bonds this year but we don't know to who?   Other banks?   How the hell will that be helpful?   Unintentional system risk could come from the Basel III Bail-In Regime.   Go google that for fun.
3. RBC.   There were rumors in Toronto that a dry-run of the RBC absorption had happened and that the new suitors were even identified (TD and BMO).   Those rumors emerged around the time that RBC stated publicly that their Chinese Bonds were only a small portion of their balance sheet.   
4. Canada mortgages.   It's long been believed that Canadians can't walk away from mortgages if the underlying asset collapses in value.  Not so.   If you declare bankruptcy (say your house is 200,000 underwater) then the 'underwater portion' is fully discharged under the bankruptcy.  You walk away from the house of course - but also the debt.     It's a bit more complicated than that - but Canadian mortgages are not as 'full recourse' as some would believe.
5. And don't forget the follow-on impact to real-world employment.    How many mortgage processors, bankers, real estate agents, yacht brokers, wait staff, retail clerks, manufacturing employees will lose their jobs in the contraction?   That exacerbates the problems above.
6. And finally, much has been made of the fact that the Fed's tools have been exhausted.   Welcome to Stagflation.   The solution - a period of prolonged high interest rates, increased tax rates combined with reducing the monetary base and government belt tightening.    The reset will probably take 3-10 years.   

The sad part is that if the fed has used a helicopter to deliver the cash to average people (rather than the banks) then standards of living would have gone up, income equality would have improved, asset inflation would still be happening as would inflation - but interest rates would have also gone up, giving the Fed its usual tools to address it.

Progressive taxation could have kept the budgets balanced too.   With so much cash swirling around in the real economy - governments can stick their fingers in and grab what they need.   It's a paradox but well established.

Who actually loses out from a minimum wage increase? Does anyone?,"I'm going to assume you've followed those discussions and have read the [minwage faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage) - and thus sort of understand the concept of monopsony power. 

Clearly, a firm will only hire an individual as long as the marginal product of labour ≥ the wage costs. In a competitive environment, these should be equal. As a result, your wage should be equal to your contribution. 


If this is the case at the current minimum wage, and we raise it, there is only one logical result - the firm would hire fewer people. Some people are namely costing them more than they are earning them.


If there are little to none negative employment effects, the conclusion follows that employees indeed were paid below their marginal product, and there was monopsonistic power. Monopsonistic power results in (above market) profits for the firm. Those will thus be lowered as the labour costs increase.


Edit: let it be noted that I am reasoning for a case in which employment is not (or barely) affected. Clearly, if employment *is* affected, the losses are shared by both workers and employers. In that case there was no monopsony power. Plus, this is a continium - if the minwage = $10 p/h, and a workers' productivity = $12 p/h -&gt; a raise to $12 p/h has no effect on employment (loss for company, win for worker), if we raise to $13 p/h (resulting in a loss for company, win for workers who stay employed, loss for workers who become unemployed) the effects for workers as a group is ambigious and the total surplus is not maximized anymore. If we raise to $70 p/h, everyone loses."

Complete Guide to Trading The Wheel – Thetagang Strategy,"Yes good breakdown. I have a couple tweaks that I think are useful.

The first is to use ratio spreads and synthetic longs in some situations. This can allow you to more safely trade very high IV tickers that you like for the long term. CCIV is an example of this for me, but you are right that it is not the best pick for a tradition wheel strategy.

Using CCIV as an example: at $25 or under I'd sell an ATM put and buy an ATM long. I'm high conviction it's going up, so this lets me capture the upside more than a put and gives me the option to exercise and go long stock. If it goes down and I'm assigned and the long call expires worthless, I don't care because I'm happy to buy at 25 anyway. 

At $25-$50 I'll just sell the .3ish delta put.

Over $50 I'll look for entry selling 2 OTM and buying 1 ATM put. You are basically using a short put to fund a but debit spread. I like to do ratios for a small credit.

Let's say I'm assigned in the lower end of the price range and I'm high conviction there is a lot of upside. People alway complain about how they sell a CC and the underlying blasts through the strike price. Solution: sell two OTM calls and buy one ATM call. This is sometimes called a ""stock repair strategy"" because you can do this to break even faster on a stock that tanked, but you can also just use it to capture more upside on volatile stock you believe in. 

What if you got got last week and one of your .3 delta calls went deep ITM and got assigned? What if you want to sell covered calls but you think the underlying may take a few months to recover and the price you were assigned at doesn't have the premium to make it worth it to cap your upside? What if you don't want to use up all that buying power for months holding 100 shares? Solution: sell the stock for a loss, buy a deep ITM call six months out. Then sell 2 OTM and buy 1 ATM call for an PMCC ratio style. Free up that buying power.

Second tweak is: don't limit yourself to ""cash secured puts"" use margin responsibly. You aren't paying interest unless you get assigned, and stay small enough that you could get assigned and not be called. If you are young, margin reduces your risk over time. There is literature on this. It is actually very helpful have a margin account and be able to clearly see how the broker views your risk level per position. This is even more useful with portfolio margin so you can see how they view the risk of your portfolio as a whole. If using Reg T margin, try not to use more than 60% buying power and only do so when the premiums make the risk worth it. If using portfolio margin, be much more conservative with the buying power % because you may have about triple the leverage of Reg T account."
How exactly did the 2008 bubble pop?,"Slowly at first, then very suddenly, when an inability to cover their obligations for mortgage-backed derivatives caused Bear Sterns and then Lehman Brothers to fail. The Lehman collapse caused an immediate stock market crash. Businesses all over ceased discretionary spending at once and the whole global economy slowed pretty much immediately. It all came back to those major issuers of derivatives being unable to meet their commitments and everyone realizing how much mortgage-backed securities risk was embedded in global finance."

Why do doctors and nurses have such terrible work-life balance when they have such a high skill set and are in-demand in the healthcare labor market?,"I challenge your claim that working hours are lower for high earners. For example, have a look at this paper: https://www.nber.org/papers/w11895.

&gt; According to Census and CPS data, the share of employed American men regularly working more than 48 hours per week is higher today than it was 25 years ago. Using CPS data from 1979 to 2006, we show that this increase was greatest among highly educated, highly-paid, and older men, was concentrated in the 1980s, and was largely confined to workers paid on a salaried basis. We rule out a number of possible explanations of these changes, including changes in measurement, composition effects, and internet-facilitated work from home. Among salaried men, increases in long work hours were greatest in detailed occupations and industries with larger increases in residual wage inequality and slowly-growing real compensation at 'standard' (40) hours.

In general, the higher your hourly wage, the longer hours you are working nowadays. This holds up all the way to the CEO level at the largest multinationals. See this paper for more details: https://www.nber.org/papers/w6504.

&gt; I investigate how the relationship between the wage and the length of the work day has changed since the 1890s among prime-aged men and women. I find that across wage deciles deciles, and within industry and occupation groups the most highly paid worked fewer hours than the lowest paid in the 1890s, but that by 1973 differences in hours worked were small and by 1991 the highest paid worked the longest day. Changing labor supply elasticities explain the compression in the distribution of the length of the work day. In the 1890s the labor supply curve was strongly backwards bending, perhaps because men preferred to smooth hours over their work lives rather than bunch them as they do today. In fact, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution was slightly negative in the 1890s, but by 1973 was positive. I show that the unequal distribution of work hours in the past equalized income, but that between 1973 and 1991 it magnified weekly earnings inequality, accounting for 26 percent of earnings inequality between the top and bottom declines among men, more than all of the earnings inequality among women, and 17 percent of the increase in total household earnings inequality among husband and wife households."
What are the most contested and cutting-edge questions in economics today?,"Here's one of some interest: what is the effect of pre-k on children's short, medium, and long run educational outcomes? 

Very well done studies exist to support the view that the effect of pre-k is large and positive: the kids go to pre-k, they get a jump on school and develop social skills and such, they do well in elementary school, they then do well in middle school, they then do well in high school, they then do well in the rest of their life, and then eventually the kids' kids do well also. A good example of evidence pointing in this direction would be the Heckman evaluations of the Perry Preschool problem. 

Other well done studies exist to support the view that the effect is anywhere from ""small short run gains, which disappear by middle school"" to ""no effect whatsoever"" to ""actually, pre-k hurts the kids and leads to worse educational outcomes"" to ""pre-k seems to help a lot on a bunch of health outcomes, but maybe that wasn't the pre-k per se so much as the food and medical care that this pre-k program happened to provide"".

Why is there this variation? 

A lot of it is that pre-k programs often differ a lot. Some of the apparently more effective ones are quite well run, targeted children form the poorest families, and have a lot of well qualified stats. Some of the state run ones are also very well run, others less so. Head Start programs, meanwhile, vary immensely in terms of just exactly what the do. What is the formula for getting a working, effective pre-k program? We need to figure that out. Is there a formula for an effective pre-k program that we can scale up to provide everywhere in the country? Also still an open question. 

There is considerably more to this question still. Part of the issue seems to be that the impact of pre-k programs varies by family income -- it seems that pre-k programs often do not outperform whatever well off families were doing anyway. Sorting this out better, however, would be useful."
Are Wall Street and Hedge funds serving their social function?,"Short-selling is good.

Would a $15 minimum wage hurt or help small business and the economy?,"From Krugman:

&gt;So what are the effects of increasing minimum wages? Any Econ 101 student can tell you the answer: The higher wage reduces the quantity of labor demanded, and hence leads to unemployment. This theoretical prediction has, however, been hard to confirm with actual data. Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages ""do,"" in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces.

tl;dr: maybe there will be some small negative effects and maybe some small positive effects."
"Is there a consensus among economists on statements of the type ""The economy tends to do better when the president is Democratic/Republican""?","The report cites a [paper](http://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/DemRep_BlinderWatson_July2015.pdf) from well-respected economists that does in fact show the economy has performed better under Democratic Presidents. The largest issue with this is that the President has a very limited influence on the economy. If you widen your approach, [538 has a good project](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) you can play around with showing how you can easily make a case either way just depending on what politicians you include (President, Representatives, Senators, and Governors) and what economic metrics you study.

Additionally, it needs to be noted that it can take years or even decades for the full consequences of economic policies to play out--so results ""under"" one party could quite easily be partially attributable to members of the other party in power at some point earlier."
Does anyone else willingly pay the Medicare surcharge?,"If the medicare levy surcharge specifically went into the medicare/healthcare system, then I would completely agree.

But as it stands, that's not the case.

Your $1400 medicare levy does not result in an extra $1400 in the public health system.

Whereas your $1000 hospital cover allows you to use the private hospitals, which takes pressure off the public health system.

"Why does Belarus have the 3rd best Gini coefficient worldwide, very low income inequality, despite being a dictatorship?","Income doesn't really matter for the gini coefficient - only how equally it's distributed. The private sector is relatively small in the country, and the public sector wages are highly regulated, meaning the wages of most people sit within a relatively smaller range than in most European countries. 

Dictatorships lead to cronyism and that can boost inequality, but if the circle of elites is relatively small, then this is unklikely to shift the gini coefficient much."

Should I stay clear from cryptocurrency and just focus on the stock market?,"Well, it is about risk tolerance. The best way to get rich is to go all-in in one asset... it's also the quickest way to get poor. I wouldn't go all-in on one cryptocurrency, but if you look at bitcoin, it did survive (and one could say, thrive) since 2009. It survived many adverse events, and one interesting metric is that it's 200 weekly EMA was never negative - meaning that someone buying BTC never lost money if they held for 4 years.

But could it crash, and crash hard? Yeah it could. Could it go to zero? Yes it could. As the old investor adage says, ""Don't invest in things you don't understand"". If you read on BTC and feel confortable in the technology and that it's going to stick around, put whatever amount you feel comfortable, and if past returns are indicative of future returns (which any financial advisor is obligated to tell you, isn't always the case), if you are ready to hold for four years you could have some profit in your pocket.

So yeah, it all depends on risk tolerance and asset allocation. Good luck and DYOR."

Question about buying term insurance - limited payment duration,"No, this is in no way advantageous to you.

However, it's a great thing for the insurer, as they get paid upfront.

Most common tactics employed by insurers and banks, heavily rely on the fact that common men lack perception of _time value of money_.

----

### Opportunity Cost

This deal is presented to you as _you pay less over the years_.

But in reality, you actually pay more.

For most term insurers, the problem is people surrendering their policies after 5-10 years of enrolling in it. This is a good thing!

Insurance is supposed to act as an umbrella while you build a roof over your head. It's possible that within few years of taking the insurance cover, your net worth exceeds the cover amount. 

At that point, paying premium on that insurance is pointless - in the event of your demise, your nominees can simply inherit your assets, no need to go through an insurance claim process.

In the meantime, insurance company loses a paying customer.

So how to mitigate against this? Enter new gimmick - pay more upfront over smaller duration of time.

The insurer bets that paying 5L over 10 years, can have equal or even better ROI; than paying 9L over 40 years.

Assume Nifty TRI returns are 8% p.a. for long term. Then, an SIP of 50k / year, for 10 years, would be ~7.7L at the end of 10th year. And this 7.7L corpus would be ~77.48L in amount, in another 30 years. No inflation-adjustments were done.

Now, an SIP of total 9L in amount (22.5k / year) spread over 40 years, at 8% p.a., becomes only 65L!

Reverse the situation.

You've an opportunity cost:

- if you take the 5L over 10 years plan, you lose the opportunity to turn that into 77.5L over 40 years
- if you take the 9L over 40 years plan, you lose the opportunity to turn that into 65L

Which one would you rather take?

The second one also give you the option to have less _sunk cost_ 10-15 years down the line.

----

### Another perspective

You could also think of it as every passing year, due to inflation, you're paying less in value to the insurer.

The premium remains fixed at 22.5k / year. That changes in value, as more time passes.

Assume long term inflation (not talking about CPI, the inflation that actually applies to you), is ~8% p.a.

Then after 10th year, you're effectively paying 10.42k / year in today's value

After 20th year, you're effectively paying 4.82k / year in today's value

After 30th year, you're effectively paying 2.23k / year in today's value

At the 40th year, your last premium, would be 1.03k in today's value

And you always have the option to opt out with peace of mind, when your net worth crosses 2 Cr.

Received a $4300 check from Wells Fargo and a letter admitting that they wrongfully repossessed my father's vehicle that I was a cosigner on 5ish years ago.,"I am an attorney, and I would tell you to **NOT** cash the check yet, and speak to an attorney promptly.  This is not a settlement from a class action unless you were previously given class action paperwork.  The check would come from an attorney telling you that this is the result of a class action settlement.  It doesn't.  It looks like WF just realized they fucked up and are trying to pay you off.

My guess is that $4000 and change is not sufficient to compensate you for the damage to your credit history and other impacts this has had on you.  An attorney may take it on contingency and this impacts your potential recovery, but this usually gets factored into a settlement so that the final settlement amount is enough to pay back the attorney and put at least 100% of what they owe you back in your pocket.  Additionally, under the FCRA and other statutes, the attorneys can recover their fees if they are successful, so it may not impact you at all.

It's a little more headache, but it could put several thousand more dollars in your pocket.  It also sends a message to them that this kind of conduct is unacceptable.   Your dad may want/need to be involved too.  Ideally, look for an attorney in your area who handles FCRA claims against banks and other lenders.

**TL/DR: Don't cash the check yet.  Find an attorney who handles FCRA claims.  Your dad may want to be involved too.**

How do you tell smart money from dumb money?,"You make a good point! I'm just marveling at the fact that Redditors were able to ~~single-handily~~ take a company with a market cap of less than one billion, and bid the market cap up to 24 billion (although now it's down to 13).

I recall Buffett noting a few years back that he doesn't short stocks, since when you short a stock you only stand to see a 100% return, but your losses could be (theoretically) infinite.

Why is the dollar getting stronger despite untamed inflation?,"A major factor in exchange rates is interest rates. For an oversimplified example, if I can put my money in a U.S. bank and earn 5% interest, or a European bank and earn 1% interest, I will be willing to pay a higher premium to hold my money in US dollars. The U.S. is currently raising its interest rates faster than many other developed countries. Also, for the euro specifically, Europe is seen as being at greater risk of destabilization from the conflict in Ukraine because they are dependent on Russian oil and gas, and because they share a landmass with Russia. Finally, the US dollar still benefits from a perception of it being a stable and universal reserve currency, so in times of crisis or instability, it tends to fare better than other currencies."

You call your broker, usually at the bank, ask for a quote and submit the order you'd like to buy if it was close to the price you wanted. Some people still put in limit orders and things like that, but most people just put in an at-the-market order when the price was near what they believed reasonable.

In the mid aughts, Tim Apple's predecessor Steven P. Jobs the 12th single-handedly invented the iPhone. It's a common myth that Apple had a lot of engineers behind the scenes. That's a lie. It was only Steven. That's why he's always on-stage alone, there was nobody else.

Can someone please explain how someone with a typical day job can buy multiple homes?,"When I was a kid I had a neighbor who was a metro city bus driver. His wife had a hair salon in the back of their house. My neighbor used equity from his home for a down-payment on his second property.  He repeatedly used equity from his other homes to buy more homes.  He did this for 30 years.  I ran into him after he had retired from the metro city bus driver job. He told me he had acquired 33 properties in those 30 years.  He had just finished paying them all off when he retired. His properties are worth approximately $3 million. His monthly rentals brought in approximately $45K per month when we last spoke. When he bought them way back in the late 70s through early 80s those properties cost about $25K-$35K. He had an account at the metro city bus credit union.  Credit unions are very helpful to members. I'm sure his stable and secure city job made it easy to get the loans on those properties. Anyway,  that's how my neighbor did it. He's now a millionaire. He's also 70 years old now. So it does take time to do it that way."
What’s the point of “rigorous” math in Economics?,"It depends on what you want to do with it.

Economics as an undergrad program is underrated because the concepts are so beneficial and you can take that knowledge in any industry.

However, if you want to get into a graduate program or do some kind of research, it's helpful to have that math rigor. In my graduate program, we didn't use a lot of calculus, but we did use a good amount of proofs. I think perhaps the calculus may be meant to just keep your mind sharp.

One of the most exciting things about economics, in my opinion, is causal inference. For this, it's vital to understand probability and statistics (it's helpful to understand linear algebra, too)."

Daytrading vs swing trading vs scalping strategies,"Day trading is ruled by professionals and takes years of experience to make profit from.

Scalping is ruled by AI-wielders who can calculate an edge in the fraction of a second.

Swing trading, the ""market noise"" from both of the above is greatly reduced, and therefore it is much easier to make a consistent profit. I personally know two multi-millionaires traders that make their money from swing trading. I know no one that actually makes millions scalping or day trading.

If I could learn trading again, I would skip the countless hours it takes to get good enough to scalp or day trade, and focus on the patient art of swing trading. 

I suggest using only the daily chart, building an algorithm (a set of rules that you follow no matter what) backtesting it until you know it wins, and then forward testing on a demo for 6 months or so, before risking actually money. Sounds pain staking, but if I had gone that route I wouldn't have lost near the several thousand dollars that I have.

"For the love of god, please learn what market caps are","Not to be that guy, but I want to make a distinction here. Market cap is not how much money is actually in an asset (that would be almost impossible to calculate and would require determining the sum of the basis for all holders of an asset). Market cap is a rough approximation of what the totality of a particular asset or equity is valued at if all of the current supply of an asset or equity were sold at the current market price for one coin/share/bond/unit of the underlying asset."
"AMA: Jason Abaluck, an economics professor at Yale best known for work in health economics, Covid policy (masks and vaccines), choice and inattention, and yelling at an old man on Twitter about causal identification","On the topic of causal inference and your arguments with Pearl (big fan of all that, by the way), do you have any advice on how to spread the light outside of good causal methods outside of economics?

My sense is that Pearl and his camp are emblematic of the problem I see with reaching out to other fields. People like Pearl who have excellent technical training and have a toolkit that should be able to get them pretty far don't because they have no intuitive sense that selection on unobservables is actually important. Meanwhile, non technical outsiders who might have solid institutional background in some setting get cowed by technical content and accept on faith that Pearl's pile of math (or whatever variant of PSM that's been gassed up enough to confuse them) actually solves all problems. I tend to think spreading the light of causal inference shouldn't be hard (lots of sketchy observational work boils down to claiming identification conditional on the research having a complete, high resolution picture of all causal mechanisms at play in their setting plus excellent measures of all variables - claims most would disavow as preposterously arrogant if put to them clearly). But in practice, I have less luck than I'd like."

Is option trading even possible in the UK?,"This is an old guide thats been deleted bit i saved it before. NOT MADE BY ME

This is guide to US options trading from the UK, because I've seen countless requests of people browsing in /r/ukinvesting, /r/options, /r/wallstreetbets etc. about this.
First thing's first - no part of this post is to be taken as financial advice. It is a guide on how to start options trading from the UK. Options/CFD trading is a high-risk activity and most retail traders lose money.
1. CFDs vs. Options
So getting started, options and contracts for difference (CFDs) are both financial derivatives - they derive their values from an underlying security e.g. stock, indices, currency, commodities. Long story short, CFDs are more akin to selling naked options - if a position moves against you far enough, you will be forced out of your position either via a stop-loss or a margin call. With options, you can limit the losses using spreads, which means you don't need to use margin and you also maintain your position even if it moves hard past your maximum loss (key is that if it comes back into profit, you'll be back in play)
CFD trading is regulated as gambling is (and due to this is even treated as tax-free on profits), whereas Options Trading is highly regulated as financial instruments because they genuinely have a use beyond speculation - institutions regularly use options to insure their funds and hedge against major risks for example.
2. Brokers
For this reasons above, there is basically no options market in the UK - the only broker at this time is Saxo, and they only do vanilla options on Forex. Everyone else only does CFDs and/or stock (T212, Freetrade, IG, Plus500 etc.). To engage in true options trading, the only choice is to open an international/US brokerage account.
The two that are accessible to UK investors are Interactive Brokers (IB) and TastyWorks. Both are reputable brokers and have strong insurances for cash &amp; securities held with them.
* IB is quite expensive (£20+ pcm minimum), but is the full bells and whistles international trading platform - you may access European options as well as worldwide markets on stocks/currency/anything you want really. Recommended for high value traders/investors. 
* TastyWorks is the opposite - free accounts, low fees (zero inactivity, free stock trades, low option trading fees), though they charge $45 for cash withdrawals. TastyWorks primarily offer trading on US options and stocks, so anything listed on the American stock exchanges are game, including international companies listed via ADRs (e.g. global UK companies, especially on FTSE100). 
3. Opening an account
I will walk through some of the aspects of funding and operating a TastyWorks account from the UK, as this is my recommendation if you're here looking for a cheap way to get started.
Opening a free account on TastyWorks is easy (form filling within 20-60 mins - you will need a photo of proof of ID and address). It typically takes 1 day for cash accounts and 2-3 days for margin accounts to be ready for funding. My referral link if you feel this guide deserves the effort is: https://start.tastyworks.com/#/login?referralCode=GD9EGGNZYZ. (mods, happy to remove this is this guide is deemed low effort)
The account types are:
* Cash. Recommended to start because you can always open a margin account easily later. Able to buy long calls/puts and sell covered options. No short stock allowed. 
* Basic (margin). Able to sell naked puts, and trade defined-risk strategies i.e. anything with a known maximum loss before entering the trade. E.g. credit/debit spreads. Note that naked puts carry significant risk - this is equivalent to CFD trading on margin, and you can have your position forcibly closed at unfavourable market rates if you overleverage. 
* The Works (margin): everything above, and able to sell naked calls. Note that naked calls carry HUGE risk - this is equivalent to CFD trading on margin, and you can have your position forcibly closed at unfavourable market rates if you overleverage. The difference in naked calls and naked puts: stock can only go to zero, limiting the (huge) loss on a naked put, whereas a naked call has theoretically unlimited loss since stocks can (theoretically) go to infinity. 
4. Funding the Account
Since trading US options is done in USD, the account must be funded in USD. With TastyWorks, the only option for UK traders is to deposit ""By Wire"", assuming you do not have a US bank account - full instructions for the ""By Wire"" method will show up when you are approved to fund your account.
TastyWorks does not accept third party transfers (accounts not in your name), so services such as Revolut and TransferWise (inc. borderless) do not work (not directly at least).
You can either do an international wire from a GBP account directly (expensive, especially for smaller amounts &lt;£1000) or set up a USD currency account and transfer through that. If you have the time, I recommend the USD currency account.
The account of choice is the Barclays USD Foreign Currency account - you need a current account with them to be able to open the USD account. Once the USD account is open, you can transfer into it using Revolut/TransferWise (cheap) and then international (wire) transfer from Barclays account to TastyWorks (free!). Note that the Barclays USD account is still a UK bank account, so you'll need to use a SWIFT transfer from Revolut/TransferWise to turn your GBP into USD.
To withdraw funds, do the opposite, noting that $45 with be charged by TastyWorks per withdrawal.
That's it for the guide - happy trading, and if there are any questions, feel free to get in touch and I'll edit the answers in here. I want this to be a resource because I've helped many people get started, and it would be good to have it all in one place!"

Why is the Argentine economy so bad?,"This is a very broad topic (that I'm sure plenty of people have written papers about). Nonetheless, two factors to consider include:

* Fiscal responsibility on the part of the Government often involves making policy decisions that are politically unpalatable. For example, many developing nations (like Argentina) have a bloated public payroll (i.e. unnecessarily large public service). In this situation, reducing the size of the public sector to shore up the national budget is a wise fiscal decision, but would generally be  politically unpopular. Here, the Government is left with two choices: take the easy way out and kick the can down the road (i.e. do nothing to reduce the size of the public service) or alternatively, make the tough decision to cut the size of the public service. The latter often ends with the populous revolting and/or voting in a populist Government that promises to restore public service jobs (and thus, the cycle repeats). The net effect is that it is often hard for Governments in countries like Argentina to implement fiscal policy that maximizes productivity and/or growth.
* Developing Nations like Argentina often have to borrow in foreign currency terms (typically USD) as their own currencies are unstable (I'm not going to lend to you in Argentinian Pesos as a US entity if the peso is inflating at 100% a year, thereby reducing how much I get paid back in USD terms). In the event that the economy begins to perform poorly (if say, economic mismanagement results in inflation), the value of the local currency may depreciate, but the value of foreign denominated debt remains the same. In effect, as the local currency devalues, the size of  foreign denominated interest payments increase, reducing the national budget. This creates a negative economic spiral that leads to the currency depreciating more, which often (and certainly in the case of Argentina), leads to default.

The (cynical) side of me (as someone that works in finance) would also argue that Hedge Funds have short memories and always seem to be lured back into lending to countries that have previously defaulted on a ""this time it's different"" basis, typically because there is often a very large credit spread between debt issues by countries that have defaulted and Treasuries/Investment Grade Corporates. This often gives countries with weak institutions access to foreign denominated debt capital, which is in part, how you end up with a nation like Argentina defaulting so often."
Upvote if you think ethtrader should create a community rating service for ICOs,"I've been saying this for awhile. I've made a couple posts about it, and actually have a couple pages of notes of how I would approach it.  
  
Different things should be weighted differently in a rating system, here's a few points that should be considered when issuing a rating on smart contracts.  
  
* Ether Lock Schedule in place  
* Start Time in contract, allows sharing of address before go live (reduces scam ops)  
* Prefunding, allocating tokens to certain investors beforehand. What %?  
* White Paper  
* Alpha, or working product  
* Teams history, any known scam projects etc etc etc   
* Multisig Keys
  
  
There are probably a dozen other variables to take into account, all of them should be given certain weight. If this project of yours were to hold an ICO of it's own, the tokens could be used by companies to submit their ICO for review.  
  
I'm interested in helping out anyway I can, like you, I see the need for a ""JD Power"" type rating system, or something along those lines.   
  
What does this do for the devs? Well after we review the code, they will have a badge they can host on their site, if someone clicks on this badge, it will be redirected to our page. On our page, we will outline the rating in plain text for the average user to understand the structure of the crowd sale. Of course, making no predictions on the value of the tokens.

What is the deal with all the sub-$8000 houses in Milwaukee? Are they traps?,"I live just outside of Milwaukee and have properties in Milwaukee.  The houses you see for $8k are not habitable and will require $50k - $75k in renovations.  Once that is done, you now have a $60k to $90k house in a neighborhood where they WILL be trashed and you WILL be evicting every second tenant. My wife did in home health care for a bit and would visit homes in these neighborhoods daily.    There would be new bullet holes in the windows/siding of a home on a regular basis and the tenants would just kind of shrug it off as ""eh, what's a few more vents in the wall?"".  

Plus the house you just dropped $50k - $75k into is worth about $40k in good, renovated condition.  Plop that same house in a different neighborhood in Milwaukee (Bay View / East Side / etc.) and it's $250k - $300k house.  There are some good returns to be made in Milwaukee, but you do NOT want the headache of those if you are an out of state investor."

"
Is this correct? The only true hedge against inflation is debt.,"&gt;Is this correct? The only true hedge against inflation is debt.

No. Hedges against inflation don't have to be terribly complicated, anything with sustained positive real returns works just fine. In practice, something like an index fund is plenty.

&gt;I hear how gold and perhaps bitcoin are “hedges against inflation”, but never hear a logical theory behind the claim.

As far as more ""active"" hedges go, you want goods that rise in value when inflation goes up. A lot of commodities work fine for that.

&gt;I could borrow $10 million, buy all the cool stuff that I would ever need for the rest of my life, and when repayment comes due, the hyperinflation would mean that I would be paying back almost nothing. But I still have all my cool stuff.

"Who actually owned the houses in ""The Big Short""?","There was a lot going on and there's a lot to unravel, but at a high level, this is what was happening:

Bank lends money to a poor credit.  The bank funds the mortgage by ""securitizing"" it, which essentially means they sell it to a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle (SPV) incorporated in the caymans or wherever, which in turn issues notes to investors.  

The notes are tranched, which means the notes are broken into multiple classes and are paid in order from top to bottom.  The A notes receive a good rating from the rating agency and they're sold to pension funds, etc.  The lower classed notes are sold to investors with larger risk appetites. 

All the way at the bottom is the ""equity,"" or the residual interest.  These are highly risky and unrated.  Sometimes the bank could sell these, but sometimes it just kept the equity on its own balance sheet.

At some point, investors like Burry wanted to bet against these notes.  As shown in the movie, investment banks structured credit default swaps to accomplish this.  The CDS is essentially a bet that some basket of notes will fail.  The opposite of that bet is a synthetic interest in the notes.  So Burry would pay the equivalent of interest (or premium) and the swap counterparty in return would promise to pay out if the notes defaulted.  From the swap counterparty's perspective, it was as if they owned the notes directly. 

When the housing market turned and all hell broke loose, the servicer (which is the entity that actually manages the mortgages on behalf of the securitization SPV) would foreclose on the loans.  The property therefore belonged to the SPV and the proceeds from the sale of the property would go towards paying off the noteholders.  The A notes got the money first, followed by the lower class notes.  

When the SPV ran out of money, the notes defaulted.  In parallel, this triggered a payment under the CDS.  The swap counterparties experienced a default just like the noteholders, except they never owned the notes. 

There is a lot to be said about why any of this was possible in the first place, and Dodd Frank and other regulations have been passed to address some of the underlying incentives.  It's a different discussion whether any of those regulations worked in the way intended, but hope the above sheds some light on what was going on."

The power of compounding with a $50k portfolio at a conservative 3.5% yield.,"Nice post OP! If there's one thing I would like to clarify it's that Altria does not belong to the same category as  AT&amp;T, Ford, IBM. Explaining why would require a post of it's own, but I'll try to summarize it in this comment

\- Altria probably has one of the lowest (if not the lowest) capex amongst all the companies listed in the S&amp;P 500.

\- Free cash flow has grown every single year since the PM spinoff despite all the doom and gloom around US tobacco usage.

\- 80% payout ratio is by design (that might change moving forward as they invest more in reduced risk/cannabis products)

\- Even if FCF stops growing, because this stock trades so cheaply you're getting a 8-10% FCF yield that almost entirely comes back to the shareholder in the form of dividends/buybacks.

\- Yes they operate in a declining industry, but they essentially sell a product with very high pricing power and operate in a duopoly that are backed by the states to do so (long story, but look into the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998)

\- Cannabis is a wild card, but if if I were a betting man (and I am) I'd say based on their experience selling a highly regulated product and access to cheap capital (legacy tobacco products that require no reinvestment) gives MO has an edge in becoming a dominant player in the cannabis space.

TLDR: Low capex, fat profit margins, strong pricing power, backed by governments for the taxes they generate and a stock that always trades cheaply (which enhances the effects of buybacks and dividend reinvestment) is why tobacco companies have and will continue to outperform the broader market over a full business cycle."
"Sorry for asking stupid question. But does anyone (from non finance/accounting background) really self learn value investing and got really good at it ? If so, what approach did you follow and how much time it took to get you good at this ?","The most basic thing you can do is learn to read a annual/quarterly report.

If a company has $10 billion in assets, and 6 billion in liabilities, assume if someone were to buy it today, it’s worth $4 billion.

If it is trading with 1 billion shares, it’s a $4/share company. If it’s trading at $8/share, you should not buy it. Wait until it’s $2-3 a share.

That will be a first step to avoiding buying something for more than it’s worth. I did this with FLNC. Found out they had $13/share of net worth *a month ago when they were trading at $25*.

Guess what they are trading for now? $13.9. I could’ve gone all in and been down 50%. Now I’m waiting until they hit $8. Why so low? Well, in three quarters they have continuously lost money, but, their revenues are growing. So I want to also adjust the margin of safety for cash burn and potential set backs. But at $8, I can assume reasonably to see a 50% ROE in a reasonable time frame. Whereas if I bought at $13, I might lose half and need to wait twice as long just to break even."

"Do people still subscribe to the old adage “If the shoe shine boy starts giving stock advice, it’s time to get out of the market”?","I do not subscribe to that adage anymore, nor do I think others should. However bubbles will still exist. Hear me out before you write the rest of the comment off. 

That adage comes from a different time. The access to information in that world was much different than it is now. Even more so, the access to the markets was fundamentally different. 

Stocks were not the world of the common man around the time of this adage. It was not really realistic for most people to own stocks, and stocks typically were not held the same way we do now. If you owned stocks, you were wealthy, and you didn’t own stocks the same way a wealthy person does now. You would one or two, not much more. The idea of “owning the market” and diversification was not really around yet. Hence why the stock market crash was so devastating. It wasn’t just jobs that were hard to come by, but previously wealthy people were now broke and their futures and wealth had evaporated. 

The adage basically came from that type of stock market reality. So when the mania was hitting, a shoe shine boy having access to that type of information would have been odd and very unlikely. So the information you were getting was suspect.

The world we exist in right now, is one where I can download an app, transfer money from my bank and begin buying stocks pretty much instantly. The access to the stock market is among the widest it has ever been. That is all in all a good thing. More access for more people is not a bad thing. Does it have its downsides and risk? Yes, but access is not bad in and of itself.

We also live in an era where the access to information is better than ever. You can literally learn most anything through some deep diving on Google and YouTube videos. That is incredible, and means that previous information that only would have been available to a few people, can now be available to many many more. That is also good. The downside of that is that interpreting that information becomes something that is self taught and can lead to issues. But that does mean that people can make more informed decisions than ever before. 

There is risk in this. Like you said, when people believe they are experts, they can cause issues that I don’t think I need to explain since we’ve seen the results of that in the last two years. However, mistakes aren’t limited to non-experts. Experts make mistakes too, and having more informed non-experts can help to find faults and flaws in where experts are making conclusions. 

So should you get out of the market when the shoe shine boy gives stock picks now? No, because there is every chance that the shoe shine boy has access to a wealth of knowledge that the average professional investor has available to them too. 

What it does mean, is you need to learn how to filter that evidence. Don’t take it, or experts advice, at face value. Do your own research. It’s available to you, so become informed. Maybe that stock boy is an idiot. Maybe he’s on to something. You have the ability and means to find out. Do so.

Where money can be made, idiots will gather. That doesn’t mean you should run away. Inform yourself, do your own research, and know when it is appropriate to run and when it’s not. 

And do bubbles matter? Yea, and they unfortunately always will. It probably won’t be the thing you think it is though.

Edit: well that’s cool, first gold! Thank you stranger!"

"Is saving $10,000 a year still a good effort?","Answering your question in title: yes! It's an amazing effort. I have no idea how you're able to save that much on your income while looking after your baby.

&gt;Is that amount of money still decent to save?

This one is harder to answer positively. I wish I could say yes, but as you allude to, getting a house deposit is a little unrealistic. Since you're on such a low income, banks won't lend you enough to buy a house, yet alone many apartments, until you can put up a much bigger deposit than the ""standard"" 10-20%. It's sad, but true.

You need to start focusing your energy on more than just saving. If that means saving less so you have more time, that's okay. If I were you, I'd think about whether or not your current career path allow you to boost your income significantly in the future. If not, consider training into one that will.

You can also think outside of the box. Maybe think of ways you can earn income on the side. If you can earn an extra $2-3k a year from renting out your car space, then consider doing that. Or if you have a hobby consider using it to sell things online or to your neighbourhood. You just may turn it into a sustainable business you can quit your job for.

With the work ethic you have in saving $10k on your current salary, I have no doubt you can succeed at the things I suggested."

Zillow reporting an incoming increase of ~20% this spring. What will happen if this trend continues?,"We’re currently at the culmination of a multitude of issues all coming to a head at the same time.

-	supply has lagged behind population growth for too long
-	zoning was first instituted in HCOL cities with short-term foresight, and you can’t unfuck that pig very easily. They just don’t make land like they used to /s
-	Short term rentals like AirBnB have driven down supply for residencies because they take what was originally a housing unit and turns it into a commercial property that competes with hotels and motels instead of other rentals and homes
-	although low interest rates has been awesome to experience, &lt;2% interest rates were bound to blow up in our faces with how affordable it made homes when supply wasn’t contributing to that affordability
-	work culture shifted dramatically to allow for people to live further away from where they work as long as they had the proper utilities hooked up
-	household sizes have shrunk and it’s much more common for adults to live alone
-	there’s been wage stagnation in a majority of fields despite inflation and cost of living increasing dramatically - and those who have experienced wage growth (largely and most notably tech employees) are able to absolutely bully the have-nots financially in this market
-	the internet has made local housing markets global, increasing demand
-	investment firms have been able to continually leverage their properties into a snowball effect of purchasing

This issue won’t be resolved until interest rates rise substantially (which won’t happen soon enough because the fed won’t risk shocking a spoiled economy) and supply doesn’t just catch up, but makes up for significant lost ground.

I’m just an agent in Seattle, but if I had a recommendation and a prediction, it’d be to hold onto the properties you can afford to hold for the time-being because appreciation isn’t about to reverse anytime soon, and although appreciation will slow (this year I think it’ll be closer to ~15%, at least here in Seattle), it will continue to be the strongest investment avenue until at least 2024. My main concern would be for investors in more liberal areas where regulators will apply strong rent caps and try to jump the gun on addressing housing issues without considering the indirect consequences of their actions.

Between July and October AMZN had a few sell offs; did you roll covered calls down or hold until expiration each time. The former being a higher maintenance and active management, the latter being very passive. I imagine if you had managed the calls you could have sold several calls during these corrections yielding a better return.

From my research it seems like the wheel is almost certain to underperform buy and hold stock in a strong bull market. If we could all have predicted an unbelievable rally to where the market is at today, I think we all would have been buying LEAPs. Turns out we can’t predict the future though, and so no strategy will be the best performer in all market conditions.

The data shows that despite the wheel underperforming a market over the last year, it is known to yield very similar results to buying SPY and holding over the long run. The real benefit would be that wheeling sells volatility so a portfolio becomes less volatile.

Last thing to mention. Not everyone invests in the same stocks. You invested heavily in AMZN, which went parabolic because of the pandemic. Someone heavily invested in oil or airlines obviously would still be down overall, and selling calls would be absolutely saving their portfolios."

Now, it's worth it, yes, but unless this is really a passion (not making money but financial markets and creating and developing consistently winning processes), then I wouldn't advise anyone to take up trading. 

Having said that, trading is about making money at the end of the day and that should be the end goal. Just have realistic expectations. And ignore the marketing, most of these gurus are liars.

If you're interested in day trading and scalping follow Brian Watt and Tom Dante on Twitter. If you're a swing trade person look at Assad Tannous, Tradeciety and Peter Brandt on Twitter. 

And be ready for the mind games. Trading will fuck you over in your head and you better be ready for it. But find your niche and focus on one thing at a time. Become a market specialist or a trade specialist. I.e. either a handful of strategies applied on a single market or a single trade style applied across many markets.

Good luck."
Why are Nordic countries so successful?,"Since nobody here is giving a proper answer, I’ll give it a go (mods be blessed if comment isn’t removed). For background, I studied mordern history (MA w/research paper on the Norwegian Oil Industry).

The main reasons at least to Norway’s «Oil Adventure» is of course  many things, but at its core is ‘institutional density’ (if I am to sunmarize it shortly). 

To elaborate, we have a dense set of institutional networks that have been built over centuries all the way back to some time after the Black Death (records get fuzzy until around 1550-1600). Starting with ‘gilder’ (old Norwegian for ‘feast’ in Norwegian) where a group of peasants came together in a proto form of insurance companies. They would feast together where everyone brought some food as payments, and provide food back. Notwithstanding the history of ‘gilder’, such arrangements rose and fell, but the common trend was social safety networks. As literacy started to grow to (relatively) high rates in the 1800s, our society entered what historians call ‘the organizational society’ where organizations arose rapidly. Book clubs are one example, labour unions another. As these organizations grew in number, so too did the general democratic culture (in that you often voted for who became leaders and so forth). This eventually transplanted itself to our political system, where the same phenomenon arose, in that we started to get a plethora of departments and government agencies. Especially after WW2 and the calming of the pre-war social conflicts and lower levels of poverty (and to you Norwegians, no we we’re not “always poor” before the oil- only from 1922/24 to 1936ish/1945). 

This trend of organizational growth continued after the war, only this time from the political sphere to the economic. Public companies/economic organizations a, such as OBOS (google it if you want, they are still around) are an example of how the government started to form social-economic organizations. At around the 1970s, such organizations were manifold. Another result of the high degree of democratization and literacy, was the funding of education. At around the same time, a period of our universities/education system entered what we call «the people’s universities» (folkeuniversitetene), where enrollement arose from a few hundred each year, to tens of thousands each year. I hope I don’t need to extrapolate on the usefullness of a skilled labour force to economy.

In regard to the oil aspect, one key agency  to the discovery of oil was the National Petroleum Directorate (Oljedirektoratet) and if course socially minded government policies. Instead of just pro-private policies, it was a mixed market policy. The state secretly bought l Hydro shares, a private company, as well as invited American companies to train Norwegian ones (such as Statoil) in exchange for excavation rights. As Satoil became a giant, it was established that the funds acquired was not to be spent domestically. While I don’t wanna digress too much, the point is to show how the level of organizational density lead to a very high level of democracy and literacy, which again lead to high levels of institutional density, that again lead to publicly owned economic non-profit organizations (and to “socially” minded policies as you’d be voted out pretty quickly if you didn’t).

The point is, with this high level of institutional density, highly educated work force and organizational density in at least Norway (and Scandinavia at large I would bet) it is very easy to shift the society’s efforts into what is useful and profitable. Be it oil in Norway, heavy industry in Sweden, technology in Finland, and food, or designer industry in Denmark (and whatever else the Danes do)."

Midlife Crisis fatFIRE style and was it worth it?,"The experience of reading this post was like googling a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and getting ""treated"" to a 10,000-word intro-post about someone's trip to Brazil in 2009 to find the perfect, locally-sourced, ethically-produced cacao before finally getting to the recipe four click-through pages later.

How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps,"If you believe Buffo’s mantra of being greedy when others are fearful and vice versa, how do you feel in the current market where every punter is frothing like a mad mutt at every stock that kicks over 10% gains in a day? People seem especially greedy and are willing to pay hand over fist for dog stocks at price to sales and price to earnings ratios never before seen in our markets on the premise that some dickhead will come in after them and pay more for it.

"High net worth women who have had children, what have you done to make pregnancy easier for yourself?","Focus on prepping your body physically for the pregnancy and birth. If you don’t already, start doing Pilates. I didn’t have a single ache or pain for 90% of my pregnancy I think due to my Pilates practice. (Side note, I don’t care for ‘classical’ Pilates - I would never tell a beginner to start there. I much prefer the contemporary style where instructors can use current research in addition to traditional Pilates exercises). Doing it during the pregnancy will help keep you strong. 

I’d also hire a personal trainer who’s trained pregnant women before. There’s a lot of strengthening to be done in order to comfortably carry 30+ extra pounds and care for a quickly growing potato afterwards! Squats, back strength, and arms come to mind. 

Finally, I’d start seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. They can assess how tight your pelvic floor is pre birth and help loosen your hips/general area to make birth easier. Then postpartum you should see them again to assess everything and correct any issues (incontinence after childbirth is NOT normal and can be fixed, along with many other things).  

That’s my .02 as someone who had resources like this during my last pregnancy. Also, go easy on yourself during the 1st trimester. It sucks and you just need to survive, not thrive."

Anybody ever considered taking your life savings and just moving to somewhere cheap like Mexico or something?,"The problem you'd encounter (apart from being a foreigner, needing to get by in a different language and cope with a different culture) is that, unless you're rich, you'll still have to work. Your life savings up till this point might give you a nice start somewhere cheap, but you'll need a job to keep going. 

And if you're struggling to get a good job in your current location, there's no reason to expect that it'll be any easier to get a good job anywhere else because you're still the same person with the same skill set - you're just adding additional challenges around language and culture. And whilst the cost of living will be lower, so will the wages. 

Overall its one of those things that sounds on the surface like it'd be a good plan, but falls apart once you look into it more deeply. The only way to make it work would be to carefully research where you want to move to, and prepare in advance to make sure you've got a relevant set of skills that'll give you a way to make a decent living, and to make sure you've got the language down fluently."

Why is the Argentine economy so bad?,"I’m from Argentina. You can sum it up basically in one thing: peronism.

Peronism is an ideology born in the 40’s with Juan Domingo Perón’s rise to power. His ideology was heavily inspired by Mussolini’s Italy, as Perón was a military envoy in Milan in the 20’s and he became a sympathizer of fascism right then and there.

In economic terms, peronism takes inspiration from both socialism and capitalism. Or as Perón himself named it, “socialismo nacional” (national socialism, sound familiar?). It believes in heavy government spending in the well-being of the population, nationalization of many industries, protectionism, strong labor unions, etc. Usually the effect leads to an artificially stable economy with high inflation, until it eventually blows up in hyperinflation, poverty and general instability. During Perón’s first three governments, annual inflation was about 20%. This is caused by 1.) Monetary emission and 2.) Entirely protected economy. If demand in an economy has to be satisfied by the few and inefficient national industries, you will have high inflation, which is exactly what happened in Argentina.

Fast forward to present day Argentina. Politicians, claiming to adhere to Perón’s original ideology, have been ruling since Argentina’s return to democracy in 1983 almost entirely. They heavily invested in social welfare programs, nationalized services, etc etc. The result was creating a state so big that it had become impossible to finance with taxes and tariffs, hence why Argentina has suffered fiscal deficit for the last 90 years or so. So the government had to take loans to still finance that high government spending. Due to having a high deficit, high spending and low, low revenues, the government was never able to pay back its loans. So, the result is default. Over, and over, again. 

In regards to your questions:

-Yes. Argentina has very high corruption. It is estimated that about 7% of Argentina’s GDP is taken away in government corruption. [Source](https://www.google.com.ar/amp/s/www.cronista.com/amp/economiapolitica/La-ineficiencia-del-gasto-publico-en-Argentina-alcanza-el-72-del-PBI-20180923-0032.html).

-Argentina has a lot of natural resources. And I mean a lot. Oil, lithium, aluminum, copper, you name it. But barely any is exploited at all. Argentina’s mining sector contributed a tiny fraction to the economy. What contributes a lot is Argentina’s agricultural sector, which brings in about 2 out of 3 dollars to Argentina from exports. It is by far the most productive sector of the economy, as Argentina has specialized in agriculture since independence. That’s why you always hear about how wonderful Argentinian meat is. You also have an emerging IT sector, but the future is too uncertain to guess how productive it would become. 

-Mismanagement would have to be the biggest cause of Argentina’s frequent economic crises, if you ask me. 40 years ago poverty was 7%. Now it’s getting close to 60%. That should speak for itself.

Hope it helps."

"""$15 minimum wage would reduce poverty but cost jobs, CBO says."" My question is, are fewer jobs necessarily a bad thing?","&gt;To what degree could the loss of jobs be explained by people no longer needing to work 2nd or 3rd jobs?

Very little. If a minimum wage increase reduces employment, it is primarily because some employers find it more profitable not to employ them any more. That is, there are workers presently who, given the current mode of production at their workplace, contribute less than $15 an hour to that productive process. As such, when forced to pay them $15 an hour, the employer would rather not employ them at all."
"German here, THIS IS HUGE: Bafin (The German SEC) has just confirmed in a publication that Gamestop dividend shares are incorrectly booked in Germany.","So Bafin and German Banks got it right, it was indeed a split as a dividend; but the DTCC and everyone else are either badly informed or voluntarily giving false information. Either way actually a gigantic news."
"Why are economists way more likely to vote democrat relative to the general population, but way more likely to vote republican relative to other social scientists and academics?","The insights from economics are ""markets generally work  but there are cases where market failures mean market ourcomes can be improved upon with intelligent government intervention"".

Are dragons deflationary? (Doesn’t “removal” of money just cause less inflation/deflation?),"You are correct that the removal of the medium of exchange from an economy would be deflationary.  And in the simple classical model of the economy, where [money is neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_of_money), shrinking the money supply would reduce prices, but would not otherwise affect the economy.

If in a country that uses gold coins as the medium of exchange, a dragon demanded only gold coins, and did not use the gold to buy anything -- in classical theory this would cause deflation but would not reduce real GDP, and would not actually make the country poorer in real terms. 

However, there are two caveats to this. First, removing gold from the economy would make gold more expensive (increases in the price of gold is equivalent to decreases in the price level). This will move more people and resources into gold mining, which would reduce other productive activities.

Second, before countries started using paper currency, countries were perennially money starved. The money supply (gold, silver, or copper coins) did not increase as fast as economic growth, and so countries constantly experienced deflation. We know today, that for various technical reasons, the economy works better if there is low constant inflation. (See the [Wikipedia page on inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) if you want to know why.) Deflation makes the economy less efficient and holds back economic growth. A dragon constantly draining gold from a countries would worsen the rate of deflation, thus starving the economy of money and further slowing down the economy."
What happened to pensions?,"I believe what you are referring to are ""defined benefit"" plans. These were set up by companies and were supposed to deliver future payments based on your income and years of service (and other factors). The payments were often adjusted for inflation. These seem great, but they created huge liabilities for the companies. The benefit was defined, but there was no limits put on the costs. 

These were largely replaced with ""defined contribution"" accounts. In these accounts your employer would deposit money based on a set of criteria... The amount is much more easily predicted and does not create the potential for a large future cost.

So, the cost of pensions ended up being just too high for companies to maintain. These have been almost totally replaced with defined contributions -- The effect on employees is they generally receive much less total money from the company."
Why would it not be within the interests of the wealthiest individuals/companies to attempt to eradicate poverty?,"I do agree with your logic that the economy is a positive sum game and richer customers are better overall. I'll add to that that reducing poverty can also increase people's productivity and thus mean we can all consume more. This is the same logic as to why it's better for a country to have richer trading partners than poor ones. 

But I'd like to raise a question: why would the wealthiest individuals or companies be particularly good at eradicating poverty?  If someone is living in poverty there are multiple potential reasons why. Perhaps they have mental health problems, or perhaps they have a disabled child requiring full time care or perhaps they can't find a house to rent due to zoning laws or perhaps they're living in a war zone or perhaps they're an ex-prisoner who is legally restricted from working most jobs. There's nothing about those situations that necessarily imply that a tech billionaire or Walmart is good at or even capable of fixing them all. 

One important concept in economics is ""comparative institutional analysis"". Different institutions (markets, governments, non-profits, etc) are good at different things. There's no simple one-size fits all answer. Not even for poverty. Governments are plausibly more competent at paying poor people money than at fixing difficult mental health problems, and some things, like changing bad laws, can only be done by governments."
So...How Do We Prepare for WW3?,"Start exercising more regularly and eating healthier (if possible).

The Climate Wars? You'd be better off healthier in all of those scenarios.

Please invest in mutual funds/ETFs directly if you're young instead of stocks - A personal experience,"I’m 19 and I’ve put a majority of my FD into 2-3 large caps which I have a firm conviction on, regardless of any future contingencies.

These mostly comprise of EV stocks - Motherson Sumi, Exide and Tata Chemicals. I could really care less about whether these speculative stocks flatline in the future because I’ve bought them with the sole intention of speculation, nothing less and nothing more. 

The strategy is to buy, hold and never sell. As long as I think the fundamentals and the model of the business is good, price fluctuations mean nothing to me. 

Stocks aside, I’ve also started investing in 2-3 mutual funds. This is to build the habit of regularly and periodically investing a certain portion of my allowance. All equity, large-cap, and an index fund. This is where I personally feel the ‘wealth creation’ happens.

Why is it that millenials are poorer than boomers were at the same age/is the millenial quality of life worse than the boomers?,"Two points:

The first is a bit morbid. So far, there has been less inter-generational transfer of wealth to millenials.  The [article in question](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millennials-have-just-3-of-us-wealth-boomers-at-their-age-had-21/) talks about how millenials have a lower share of wealth *in percentage terms*. That makes sense because people are living longer. Concrete numbers are hard to come by, but [this Berkeley dataset](https://u.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html) is pretty good. The parents and grandparents of boomers were far less likely to live into their 60s or 70s.  That means the 60-80 segment of the population didn't have as large of a share of overall wealth both because (a) there were fewer people in that age range and (b) boomers were more likely to have inherited from a deceased parent/grandparent. Now that most people live into their 70s, that 60-80 segment of the population has a higher percentage of overall wealth. When we look at wealth accumulation in absolute, inflation adjusted terms, the net worth of millenials [looks similar to previous generations](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/per_capita_age_real_nw.jpeg).     


Second, people have [far more education today](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png). That means a 25-year-old today is more likely to have only been working full time for a couple years, while a boomer at 25 was likely to have been working full time for 7 years or more.  The 25-year-old college grad today also probably has student loan debt, which boomers usually didn't have, even if they went to college.  That is, millenials are taking longer to enter the workforce and are starting off with more student loan debt. But, over the course of their life, a person with a college degree will usually make an [extra $1 million more](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160718_cea_student_debt.pdf) than someone without a degree. So someone ""in their mid 20s to 30s"" now with a college degree might have less wealth than a boomer at the same age, but in the long run the college-educated millenial will earn more, even taking into account the student loan debt."
"Axis Bank has suddenly decided to raise its charges and minimum balance requirements to preposterous levels, what other bank do you suggest?","I have an SBI account and an HDFC salary account.

SBI is my primary account because their internet banking rocks. While the UI might not be very impressive, theirs is the most feature complete internet banking you'll find.

Haven't been charged for anything else as far as I recall.

HDFC Salary account is pretty much the same in terms of charges. No minimum balance requirement, 100 or 150 per year for debit card, that's all. But your salary needs to keep flowing into it every month, otherwise they'll stop the benefit at some point."

"Drug addicted brother opened a credit card in my name last year and ran up a $3500 bill, I'm just finding out about it now.","**DON'T PAY THE COLLECTION COMPANY A DIME!**

If you do, they'll take it as an admission of ownership. Don't make any promises to pay, don't say you're interested in a payment plan, nothing. 

On the letter somewhere it should give you instructions about asking for validation of the debt. You'll want to send them a certified letter asking for debt validation. They can't try to collect on it until they validate it. They'll probably validate it in the sense that they will just say it's you because your brother used your information.

You will also need to contact your local police department and ask them to take a quick report. They can't really do much other than take your report, which is going to be good enough in 99.999% of cases since you're basically swearing to the police what you're telling them is true. 

You'll send that police report to the collection agency and probably the credit card company which will probably get them to stop trying to collect from you.

"Why do most day traders lose money, what do they do wrong?","Trading is a very difficult business. Takes years of training to be a consistently profitable trader. Most fail because they don’t treat it like a business. They gamble. They win big for a while and keep pushing their luck. And then like in a casino, they lose it all in a couple bad moves. 

If you see those claiming to make 100%+ in a short period of time, think about what they had to risk to get that type of return (probably 100% of their account). 

I’ll admit, it’s tempting to bet big, and some times it works out. But when it doesn’t and you try again, you blow up your account. 

Just my 2 cents."
"Do economists write ""reviews"" of government policies and if so, where can the public read them?","The [Chicago-IGM Economic Experts Panel](https://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/) is close to a (US centric) version of this. They regularly poll top economists on the efficacy and implications of controversial policies, and the economists are encouraged to provide justification and sources for their answers. Responses are rarely in-depth, but it's a fantastic barometer of general economist sentiment and can give you good starting sources. It's been running for years, so you can dig up results for just about any topic of interest."
What's in it for the Cayman Islands?,"They still charge registration fees for new businesses. Apart from that, the government levies import duties and other indirect taxes. The country has a sprawling tourism industry which generates quite an income."
Doesn't the knowledge of Economics...somehow change Economics itself? Doesn't it create paradoxes?,"&gt;doesn't knowing Economic theory change the Economic theory itself since people will apply it?

Yes. It is a widely accepted fact in social sciences, from [Goodhart (1975)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), [Lucas (1976)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique), and [Campbell (1979)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law).

&gt;So these economic theories help them anticipate some stuff like prices given certain models of how people will make decisions, right?

Yeah, _kind of_. You are vastly overestimating how much the financial industry actually uses economic models.

The most widely used ""economic model"" in financial markets is arbitrage pricing. Calling it an economic model is a bit of a hyperbole though, as it essentially only states things like _""Two apples cost twice as much as one apple""_ (obviously it's a tongue in cheek description, but fairly accurate).

&gt;It seems to be an infinite paradoxical situation!

Mathematically, not necessarily. In many cases, game theory proposes problems where both players in a game know that the other player will play optimally.

In these cases, when choosing a move, player B knows that player A knows that player B knows... and so on. You can still solve those games.

In the real world, it can of course be a problem and a source of error.

&gt;In Physics, [...]

Yes, generally speaking, most fields of economics do not reach the epistemological validity of most fields of physics. Of course, exceptions exist."

People who lived through 2000 Dotcom Crash and 2008 Great Recession - what was it like?,"I worked for a dotcom startup in 1999/2000. 

Most of my coworkers had lots of money in tech stocks and everyone was making money. A LOT of people thought they really knew how to play the stock market. Also, online trading and day trading had just recently become a thing, and people were pouring in. Sort of like what Robin Hood did for Millennials and Gen-Z, but 1000x bigger. 

There was an air of euphoria. No one thought it would end. They said it was a ""new paradigm"", and the information economy could only send valuations up. Our company loaded us up with perks: fancy coffee, we could order pizza whenever we wanted after 5 pm. Friday at noon the cases of beer showed up in the breakroom. No per diem limits when we travelled. We once racked up a $450 bill at Mortons, it was no problem. Another time, our sales guys took the project managers of a client to a strip club and racked up a $6000 bill. We had our Christmas party on a massive yacht. The list goes on.

The way money got thrown around in tech at the time was unreal and very seductive. I had a small advantage - I actually worked before I got into tech. I worked in restaurants and other service jobs. I knew enough that I knew it was insane and couldn't last, but I was also riding the high like everyone else. 

You know when the tech economy is insane? When you talk to a girl in a bar and she asks you what you do, and you say, ""I work at a tech startup"", that was a PICKUP LINE. 

There was also a lot of arrogance and FOMO. Anyone not on board with tech in some way was missing the boat or outdated. If ever was heard a discouraging word, the reply was that they were too old school, and their way of thinking about the economy was obsolete. 

There was a massive drop in quality in tech. People were trading in their fast food uniforms and became ""Tech Support Engineers"" overnight because there was such a shortage of tech workers. No training, no experience, fake resumes, etc. They just walked into recruiters and the next day they were now working in tech, making double or triple what they made before. People one rung up from the bottom like me were basically told to ""figure it out"" when it came to these people and somehow train them. I literally got one person who, when referring to a computer, said ""not the screen part, but like, the box part.""  I had to find busy work for people like those - like inventorying old equipment we planned to get rid of, or doing test prints on all the printers to see if any needed a cleaning. Total mouth-breather work. If you wanted quality, you had to pay BIG for it.

In terms of the stock market, I finally decided to get in on the gold rush. I'd gone to a pretty prestigious business school and they taught us all kinds of different ways to determine the value of a company, so I got to work looking for tech companies that looked financially sound. Only problem was, I couldn't find any. In fact, my math seemed off. WAY off. Like I was off by a decimal point and occasionally two. Like the math was telling me XYZ company was preposterous. I finally said to myself, ""You must be doing something wrong, but if you can't feel confident in these numbers, you're not investing, you're gambling."" And I just decided to stick most of my money in index funds. All these companies with HORRIFIC financials had ""strong buy"" recommendations from the ""stock analysts"". It was the blind leading people who couldn't see. 

Honestly, my go-go-go dotcom job had me working 60 - 80 hours/week anyway, and I didn't have much motivation to endlessly research stocks. I kept a little around to ""play with"", but never went big.

Then of course it ended, and one by one all my numbers and math started to make sense. LOL. The numbers back then were so wonky I like to cite [this Wired article from 2000](https://www.wired.com/2000/02/permanent-upside/) as a perfect time capsule of the thinking at the time. ""Don't like the numbers, make up new ones."" 

After the bubble burst, tech people got laid off wholesale, but the hardest hit were the aforementioned burger-flippers turned Tech Support Engineers (and day traders). As late as 2005, I interviewed many and they were easy to spot - a half-assed resume full of errors and their tech experienced ended in '99 or '00. They'd been working some crap job or ""self-employed building custom PCs"" ever since. They always massively failed the basic tech skills test we gave them."
Meta shares plummet hard on weak fourth-quarter forecast and earnings miss,"Meta has 4 of the 5 most used social media apps with between 1-3 billion users. Facebook won't grow users but it doesn't need to. It already reaches half the planet. This is clearly a MOAT. The only comp it faces is a Chinese app that could be banned. 

Facebook isn't popular with kids and young adults but IG is. It doesn't matter that much if young kids don't like these apps given adults 25+ are still likely to use them unless something better comes along.

I am unconvinced the Metaverse will be a thing, or Meta the company will benefit but Meta has tens of billions if dollars to risk on this investment. 

My opinion on Meta is it was clearly overvalued at the $300+ range, so I stayed away. As it entered the $200 range it made sense to buy, but I still thought there wasn't enough upside. At $100 it is a no brainer buy."
Is China a successful centrally planned and/or market socialist economy?,"Myself (and some of the other mods) are not happy about the number of posts like this one /u/Economy_Glass .  It seems that every day someone posts a quote from a left-wing source and asks if it's true.  It's not just you asking there are a group of people doing the same.  We are fed-up of all of you.  The others I'm thinking of here are /u/rusty_copper_crown, /u/Worker_Specific and /u/AskOrnery286.

This question is a good example.  Ask yourself this - is it likely to be right?  Is it even coherent?  Take a look at the wikipedia page on Huawei and the section on ""Corporate Affairs"" [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei#Corporate_affairs).  It doesn't take long to see that it's far more complex than saying that Huawei is simply a co-operative.  Nor is the claim in the quote even particularly coherent.  It claims that the Chinese government keeps Huawei ""Well controlled"".  In that case, in what sense do the employees ""own"" Huawei?  Ownership implies control.  If the state controls Huawei then the employees *don't* and they're not owners in the normal sense of the word.  The quote tries to appeal to supporters of Central Planning and supporter of Mutualism.  But those are different ideas.  The quote is even more wrong about Xiaomi, and you can find that out *straight away* just by searching the web.

I don't know who you're quoting, /u/Economy_Glass, or if there's more than one person your quoting.  But, most of these opinions you ask us about in quotes are rubbish.  And usually fairly obviously rubbish.

The same is true of many of your questions /u/Rusty_copper_crown.  Some are debate prompts, which are against our rules.  The answers to the others are either fairly obvious, or easy to find on the web.

""Is Cuba economically really this paradise people say it is?"" you asked this recently /u/AskOrnery286.  Do you seriously believe that the answer might be ""Yes""?  I don't think that you do, and that makes asking the question very close to trolling.

I'm not taking a hard political stance here.  I'm not saying that all right-wing or libertarian economic positions are right.  My point is just that obvious hard-left propaganda is obvious!  You know it and I know it.  There is no need to ask about it here.

In your posts you have not touched on most reasonable left-wing views.  It is easy to demolish the sort of silly view that your have asked about.  It's also completely uninteresting and irrelevant.  ""Marx was wrong and therefore all leftists are wrong"" is a fallacy and an obvious one.  Most leftists are not defending Marx, or China or the USSR.  Some of them have much more nuanced and careful arguments.  Arguments where there is no simple answer, and where *they may be right*!

I strongly suspect that you are using this forum to gather argument for debates.  I don't mind that once or twice, but we've had dozens of post like this recently.  You should do your own research. Depending on others is not very Classically Liberal.

Debate usually cannot persuade those who have already made up their minds.  Exception are very rare.  There is no point in debating the supporters of the CCP, for example.  Public debates are good for speaking practice, but for little else."
US investing options for Indians - Personal experience,"Thanks for this, I'll add my 2 cents from Vested's perspective (disclaimer - co-founder at Vested):  
1. We have 1,300 stocks and ETFs on the platform. These suffice 95% of the investors investing in the US markets from India. For the rest 5%, we keep adding securities on a regular basis. I understand that this is not ideal - we'll be expanding the stock/ETF universe  soon  
2. From a taxation point of view you might want to use a platform that provides you reports as per Indian regulations, it can get quite complicated otherwise. We give all capital gains + dividends in INR as per the Apr-Mar cycle along with the information you need to fill the summary of foreign assets. I think u/jaya1994 mentioned the reports we provide

3.  Regulation wise - better to use a platform that's regulated by the regulator in the US"
What stops ETFs from becoming worth more than their component parts?,"Great question. Not only is it possible, it happens pretty much all the time. This is a broadly similar problem for Investment Trusts as well.  
An ETF's **Net Asset Value (NAV)** is the sum of all share values minus any liabilities such as loans or other payables. In your case the NAV of ETF1 is £2.
Due to all various factors such as market differences, liquidity, timing differences and behavioural preferences its perfectly possible that ETF1 might be trading at £2.10 on the LSE. We call this trading at a **premium** (10p or 5%). If its trading below £2 we call this trading at a **discount**. 

One example of how this might be caused is that the US market is closed, but the LSE is open. Trading on a UK ETF can happen freely while its underlying US stocks are frozen until they reopen. Thanks to the magic of efficient markets these usually correct themselves fairly quickly.

Sometimes though an ETF is persistently trading at a premium. This is quite common where you have an ETF traded in an 'attractive' market or currency such as UK or US holding stocks in emerging markets with diverse currencies. As an investor even if the ETF is trading at a premium its far easier, cheaper and less risky to buy the ETF than purchase its component parts.  

To fix this the ETF manager will take matters into their own hand and try to correct the pricing difference themselves. This is called a **Creation/Redemption** (or alternatively Buyback/Issuance for Investment Trusts). If the ETF is trading at too high a premium they will create new shares in the ETF. For each new share in ETF1 they will have to buy the component Stk1 and Stk2. The extra share in ETF1 will then be sold on the market. This process increases the demand for Stk1 and Stk2 (increasing NAV) while also increasing the supply of ETF1 (lowering price). If calculated correctly this will reduce the NAV premium."
Whether one should have a credit card or not?,"I do have the credit cards offered by Flipkart/ Amazon with their tie ups with Axis and Icici.

But yeah they can promote spending habits."
How is it possible that people are leaving NYC and rents are going up?,"This is one of the cases where reasoning from a price change can be misleading. I don't have any specific knowledge about New York, but

&gt; Rent went up in NYC. Are there more people living there now, or fewer people?

Doesn't have a clear answer. People leaving NYC should cause prices to go down, but prices going up should cause people to leave NYC. So the relationship between rent and net migration is a bit complicated - it depends on why rent is going up."

How to be a good rich uncle to a first gen Ivy League freshman?,"I was that kid. What I wish I had had was career and financial advice. I literally did not know what consulting was and the names of the top firms until senior year… after other people were telling me about their intense interview prep. I also only became good at finances because I stumbled into an extra-curricular seminar on how to have a good financial life once school ended.

The only experience I would highly encourage him to do and help fund would be study abroad. It was a life-changing experience for me, and I could only pay for it because my grandmother died and left me $5k in bonds she’d been secretly holding since my birth on top of $10k of financial aid and money I’d saved from two on-campus jobs.

Otherwise, don’t push him too hard. Just visit him 2-3 times a year so he can come to you. I loved my school experience, including the skills I learned from working part-time and all of my down-to-Earth/had-never-heard-of-Tahoe friends. It’s inevitable he’ll meet and befriend a rich kid or two. He doesn’t have to entirely ingratiate himself into that world.

If he’s lucky like me, maybe he’ll just end up marrying into it and his SO can be the one who teaches him how to ski 😉

ETA: Also a good idea to pay for his parents to be able to visit him and make sure he can afford to fly home for the holidays! Would be kind of shitty if he never saw his own parents (assuming he likes them) but you came in their place all the time."

What is happening to the economy?,"There's two answers to this.

First, the economy *is* getting better, not worse. Unemployment has fallen to 4.8%, around where it was in 2017. GDP, which is roughly a measure of how much money people make, has gone up a bunch too (even after you account for rising prices). Most economists consider these two statistics to be the most important for understanding the economy.

That being said, prices are definitely going up, which is a major problem. As usual it's a supply+demand thing.

On the supply side, ramping up production takes a long time for some goods. For instance, a new fab (computer chip factory) takes about 7 (!) years to build, and finding a new hire to fill a position usually takes months.

On the demand side, people are spending more because they're more optimistic about the economy and because COVID stimulus put a lot of money in peoples' pockets. When aggregate demand increases, the economy grows and people get put to work, but prices go up.

Right now, the Federal Reserve thinks the price increases are temporary. They think that as the supply problems get sorted out, prices will fall back to normal, so they don't have to try cutting back demand and risking a recession."

Credit cards also allow you to earn points/rewards, which is free money if you use it correctly (i.e. always pay off your entire balance each month. Don’t spend more than what you can afford. You don’t want to pay interest on your bill because you can’t pay the full amount due, you’ll be paying more in the long run then. Credit cards also allow you to build up your credit score too when used properly.)"

I'm Leaving Algo Trading. Thank You,"To everyone reading this and getting discouraged, let me be a bit of a beacon of hope. I started working on stock trading systems in January 2021 after spending the last few years working on creating a profitable NCAA basketball betting system. I realized that my system research could probably work in the stock market too, and so far my paper trading and actual trading is looking promising.

A few tips:

1) Get a good source of data - nothing will invalidate your results quicker. (Hint, don't use Google Finance)

2) Don't only focus on one idea on one time frame. Come up with dozens if not hundreds of system ideas and write them down. I promise if you don't write down your ideas or todo items you WILL forget and that idea could be lost forever.

3) Learn how to use custom stock screeners for ideas and data. No need to reinvent the wheel.

4) If you do find something and the results start looking promising, audit the shit out of it. This is not a time to let your ego get in your way. If you find bad data anywhere in your results, you're better off deleting your tracked results, fixing the issue, then start the results gathering again from scratch. For example I've had to wipe months worth of data out of all my systems (approximately 500,000 paper trades at the time) because of a minor issue, but that issue would have stopped me from trusting any of the results.

5) Automate, automate, automate. Make all of your tasks as automated (and accurate) as possible.

It's not easy work, but fortunately I find it to be a really fun hobby and don't see it as work. Using the above knowledge, I have 60 unique systems running across different time frames, so basically 494 systems running daily. Currently have 2.73 million completed paper trades, 1.2 million open paper trades, and up to 83,000 new completed trades daily.

There's no one right way to algotrade. You don't have to build a trading bot. You don't have to know python, C++ (I'm using Java + MySQL DB). All my systems are based on swing trading timelines and I gather all data after hours. After everything has run for the night I generate my trading signals and put in orders manually (seems overkill at the moment to focus on a trading bot with 3-10 trades a week).

You DO have to have the desire to put in the hours. You DO have to have the ability to gain new knowledge and implement it correctly. You DO have to be willing to put your money where your mouth is to test your ideas. There's no rush to market, the stock market will continue to be around in all of our lifetimes. Don't think you're a genius because of a few good trades and don't beat yourself up because of losing trades, just make sure to learn something from every trade."
"If we all come up with a dollar or two, we could get the best securities lawyers on retainer for a class action if the SEC pulls shenanigans","Be careful about trying to organize. That is what SEC is looking for. Market manipulation. We're not organized, we're individual investors that really like the stock.

That's what this sub is about. Individual investors. People post about stocks they like. Other people look into it and also like the stock. No one tells us what to do with our own money. People buy and sell at their own will.

But it seems most people don't sell, because they really like the stock. Stonks, you see, always go up.

Speaking personally, I just really like the stock. This isn't financial advice. I just like it."
Bloomberg: Single Family Rents Surge,"Shelter or at least the pursuit of it is a human right.  All regulations on home building besides when it is unsafe for other families should be banned.

/r/thetagang needs a FAQ/wiki so I wrote one,"I realize that for those already experienced with selling options there's nothing new to learn here, but this was written for those new to theta gang.

[/r/thetagang](/r/thetagang) doesn't have a FAQ or wiki page like other subs do, so I decided to write this up with the hopes the mods would adopt it. I think it would help cut down on posts asking the same things, and be useful for those who don't have a clue where to start. I tried to cover various details that I think would be helpful to those still learning.

"I don’t understand, is everyone just started trading last week???","Market isn't even down; the Dow, SP500 are slightly up and Nasdaq has a tiny dip.

ICLN, PLUG, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, ARK funds and a bunch of tech stocks are down 10-20% since last week. They also don't have the numbers to support their current valuation so they will be the first to go down when the market tumbles."

Extra 5k sitting around. What should I do with it?,"What is the interest on the debt? 

If it is above 5% I would pay that off. If it is under than I would keep 1000 in a high interest savings account (ex: ally bank). 

Invest the other 4000 into a Roth IRA (you can put it into an etf like VTI). 

Another option if you are scared of the stock market is to invest into I-bonds which is a guaranteed 7.2% currently (you can buy up to 10k in electronic bonds for the year). 

Another option if you have a high risk tolerance and believe in crypto is to put it into bitcoin. Or you can do a combination of these things"
"If a 4-day work week makes workers much more productive, why hasn't the idea caught on?","From the article: 

""In addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails.

They suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft’s, of course).""

It sounds like the 4-day workweek was bundle with a bunch of other changes in management practice, making it impossible to disentangle the effects of any individual practice (like a 4-day work week). Unless Microsoft did a bunch of randomized treatment arms which I doubt.

Another point may be one of external validity. Japan has (relatively unique) reputation for overwork. Even if a 4-day work week did improve productivity in a Japanese office, it might not be the case that that these results generalize outside of Japan."
Are interest rates too low for India's own good,"Good points. Fully agree that Indians are forced to save due to lack of social security in case of catastrophe. Also only a minority feel comfortable investing in equities which leaves saving schemes as the main channel for most.

Unfortunately the solution is actually not to artificially fix interest rates. I'd rather have a situation where saving schemes pay less but you can get capital at low interest rates than the reverse situation. Easier and cheaper availability of capital is what will actually allow innovation and long term development."

"Maths and gambling: You could be gambling with your future not because you want to, but because you haven't thought the maths through","This is why I advice people to remain on the conservative side. Avoiding losses is more important that making gains. But people keep chasing returns, always investing in funds which have high 1-year returns.

I've shown this math many times to many people, to illustrate how a fund which falls more could be worse for you, even if it rises more.

The basic thing is that a layperson does not understand volatility or how to account for it. They only understand that a fund which has given higher return in the past is likely to give higher return in the future as well."
Can this type of attack actually happen?,"It's a possibility, but a well known one, so there are robust defences in place:

 - Most countries have legislation that allows the government to block mergers &amp; acquisitions deemed harmful to the national interest.

 - In certain strategic industries, like defence contractors, they often have either direct stakes or ""golden shares"" that given them veto powers over certain strategic matters. Some countries, like France, have rather broad definitions of what they consider to be a strategic industry.

 - In other industries, foreign ownership its restricted - in the EU, it's a condition of an airline's operating licence that it remains majority EU-owned. The US restricts foreign ownership of airlines to 25%.

 - They can also forcibly nationalise companies that are perceived as acting in a hostile manner - for example, Gazprom controlled a key gas distributor in Germany. It was believed to be harming German gas security, so the regulator seized control of it."

When you wish upon a star - a complete guide to Computershare,"I like to think of it as a math problem, if everyone registers x percent of their shares if they can, the float is locked up in the infinity pool, Now all shares are worth infinity.

If someone sells from the pool, then the rest are not worth infinity, it would take fuel from the rocket and slow the climb imo. Its why its suggested that everyone keep a few shares at a broker. If you have 14 shares in CS locked up in the infinity pool, and 6 at your brokerage, you have 6 shares worth infinity to sell. you sell one from CS now everyones shares are worth less.

"When economists say that American wages have stagnated since the 1970s, do they mean that the actual material conditions that Americans live in have not improved?","To make a long story short, the CPI only tracks ""typical"" consumption goods bought by ""typical"" households adjusted for changes in things like quality and purchasing patterns.

To make an example, it tells you how much money you need to buy a ""typical"" car in 1970 and it also tells you how much money you need to buy a ""typical"" car in 2022, it does not tell you how much money you need in 2022 to buy a 1970 car.

CPI is not a cost of living index or a standard of living index, and it's influenced by both changes in quality and purchasing patterns.

Let's say for example cars get better. Let's say the new Toyota Corolla is better than the old one, price is the same. Everything else being equal, that means the CPI for cars goes down, because you get ""more"" car per dollar.

But then let's also say people buy this new Corolla with more options, a more powerful engine, etc. and spend more on the car, CPI for cars goes up. It should be easy to see that with a bunch of such changes over decades, product comparisons become quite difficult.

Also, real wages grew by about 15% from 1979 to 2019. Slowly, but still.

"Why did Brazil fail economically, but China, Korea and Japan succeeded?","I was able to find [this presentation deck](https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/OECD-NERO-june-2017-labour-productivity-in-Brazil.pdf) from IBRE arguing that labour productivity in Brazil has increased at a lower rate due to Brazilian firms typically being smaller than in other countries (with cited sources in the slide deck; see [Akcigit, Alp and Peters (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180555)). Brazilian firms do not appear to expand in the same way as in other countries, and this may be due either to traditional business practices or due to tax incentives that provide savings for small businesses that report revenues under a certain amount.

Small businesses will be less likely to benefit from scaling up production and utilizing economies of scale per unit of labour, the definition of labour productivity. If economic and tax policy favours small businesses too much or if large sectors of the Brazilian economy are comprised mainly of small businesses for practical or other reasons, this will put a hard cap on labour productivity growth in the future. Changing tax codes, creating business incentives to expand, or diversifying the economy into industries with larger firms may all be solutions to increasing overall labour productivity."

I have inherited roughly 4.75 acres of land on the opposite side of the country. What should I do?,"Think about these two scenarios with hypothetical numbers.

**Scenario 1**

You inherit this land and look up how much you would make if you sold it. You determine that you could sell it for $100,000. 

Instead of selling though, you decide to keep it. Maybe you sit on it in hopes of land prices rising, maybe you develop it.


**Scenario 2**

Instead of inheriting this land you inherit $100,000 in cash. A friend suggests you use that money to buy this property they know about on the other side of the country. It is 4.75 acres, roughly 16mi outside of a major city, and the surrounding area is slowly being developed into housing. Your friend says you could make money by developing it or just sitting on it. 

But you decide there are better ways you could use that money.




**Why this matters**

Even though your decision in both of these scenarios may seem logical. It is actually completely irrational. In Scenario 1 your are deciding that the land is worth giving up $100,000. In Scenario 2 you decide the land is not worth giving up $100,000.

This is called the endowment effect and it is one of the main mistakes people make with money.


**So what should you do**

If you had inherited money would you use it to buy this land? If you would, then keep the land. If not than you should sell the land.

AMD surpasses INTC market cap.. Any thoughts?,"Intel constantly has overpromised and underdelivered.  Constantly.  Whether it's power/perf for a product, actual timeline to delivery, features supported, etc.   Doesn't matter.  If you're in the industry, it has been painfully apparent Intel is losing ground in data center for years.  And it's not just AMD that's been eating away.  Folks like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have either been pivoting to build their own data centers or going to AMD as is the case with Facebook.

Intel has been paraded on this sub for a long time because no one can look past ""the PE ratio!"" and no one actually understands the industry.  You have a bunch of folks who think PE ratio is the end all be all when analyzing a company.

It will be a long time before Intel can prove they can turn it around.  2 years at least, and then I'll take another look at them.  Till then, your money is better elsewhere for growth.

&gt;I won't make this post too political but I also firmly believe that  intergenerational wealth serves very little purpose for society as a  whole.

On pain of turning too political, I am genuinely very curious -

Clearly you feel like your wealth comes with a debt to society.  To what degree do you feel like this debt can/should be settled by your own involvement in government, politics, NGOs, etc. - essentially leveraging your power and wealth to try to directly improve the world, versus simply giving cash directly to others?  This is something on which it seems like public opinion has changed drastically in the last 150 years and it isn't every day I get to pick the brain of someone who actually has the wealth to do anything about it!

&gt;I think the point of diminishing returns for money is pretty early ($10-$15m)

Do you ever feel a desire to try to make significantly more wealth for the purpose of impacting the world for good?  $10m is obviously enough for most to be perfectly content with their individual consumption, but is certainly on the small side when it comes to having individual impact through charity (e.g. the impacts Bill Gates has had)."
Why are companies taxed on profit but individuals taxed on income,"1. Households/workers derive utility/welfare from consumption.

How Low Will She Go? What's the lowest you think ETH will hit in 2018?,"As far as falling knives go, you always have to do like 6 double takes before the price reaches a ridiculous bottom that was 50% below where people expected it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trading stocks when oil went from 110$ a barrel. It was assumed the price would bottom out at first at 80$, then 65$, then 55$, then 45$. At 45$ the fracking oil industry was running at a deficit and many companies in the U.S went belly up while Saudi Arabia filled the market with a surplus to retain and retake market share. The price however tanked to a low of 24$ per barrel.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of ETH, we know that the 300$ per ETH was a strong support level for consolidation for months. I can see a price bottom range of 150$ per ETH as the (50% below where you expect it to be logic). This is also the range where ETH first exploded from its bullrun in 2017 and never came close to crossing back in the negative direction.

&amp;#x200B;

In the oil case, the places to store it was running out and caused a large surplus in the market.

Complete Guide to Trading The Wheel – Thetagang Strategy,"I will add my two cents, while I agree with 95% of what you said, I disagree with the mandate of high IV/IVR.

The more volatile the underlying (high IV) the more premium you will collect, in exchange for the extra risk of course. Depending on your targeted rate of returns, it's not mandatory to target high IV. It's very possible to achieve a reasonable rate of return on ETFs like SPY.

All about targeted return and risk tolerance. A decent rule of thumb, your max draw down in a given year is going to be 50% of your target rate of return (if you are using good risk management).

50% return = accepting 25% losses at times

My wheel strategy while not conservative, is not the ""aggressive"" part of my portfolio. It aims to beat the market by a few points a year, nothing more."

The 'Law' of Supply and Demand and Economics as a 'Soft Science',"Let me clear-up some fundamental misunderstandings here.

&gt; For supply and demand to be a Law it must be true that supply curves are upward sloping and demand curves are downward sloping.

Not necessarily - they can be horizontal too. The point is that you, *ceteris paribus* won't demand more of something when its price increases. The crux of the law is a causal argument. You will generally want less of a good when a price increases. You will not want more of a good when a price increases.

&gt;  But this isn't the case, as demand curves can at times not slope downward Veblen or Giffen goods/behavior for example.

The *ceteris paribus* above is important. For a Giffen good, the main point is that the income-effect dominates the substitution effect. That is, you do not *want* more of a certain good but a lack of other options forces you to get more of the good. If you would compensate the wealth effect -- so the price would increase without a real-term loss of wealth, you would actually demand less of the good. Though I'd say compared to Veblen goods, this point would be debatable.

For a Veblen good, percieved value increases with price-increase (as noted on the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good#Non-violation_of_the_law_of_demand)). This means there is no violation of the law of demand because that assumes a *ceteris paribus* situation -- as such, paying a higher price for *the same product/value/utility*. As the product becomes more valuable with a price increase, this negates that violation.

&gt;  Economists in contemporary times like to make the argument that in general supply and demand does apply despite not always, but that precludes it from being an actual law compared to say, the Conservation of Energy or Universal Gravitation.


As far as I know, it does always apply. But what people generally fail to attach to this (and all) laws is that they work *under certain conditions* and *with certain constraints*. These are fundamentally a part of the law. The law of supply and demand explains *ceterus paribus* behavior to price changes. If you could spend x$ to get utlity y, you are not going to spend &gt;x (what about tipping? - well that increases y).

The same goes for natural laws. The law of gravity results in a conclusion that something should fall towards the earth at a given speed. But, in fact, this doesn't occur like that all. Factors like wind, air-pressure, object surface, general interference (and so on, I'm not a physicist) create results which in fact differ slightly from the intuition. The problem with laws on human behavior is then that the constraints are quite likely to be violated, that these violations aren't always systematic, and that this makes them less intuitive. Basic supply and demand models are, for example, based on free and immidiate entry, perfect information, and no transaction costs. The combination of these factors don't exist in real life -- but we do consistently emperically find that moving closer to this scenario moves us closer to the model.

&gt; Does this highlight the way the discipline shares a place with so called 'Soft' or Social Science rather than Natural Sciences?

No - that is semantics matter, not really related to 'laws'. Is neuroscience not a natural science because it has no laws? That Economics is a social science is in the name. It deals with society and human behavior. Physics deals with the behavior of 'nature'. This is what seperates the two. This is often coloqially (and in reality quite often as well in outcomes) linked -- generally consistent findings are harder in social sciences because human behavior is complex and because the performed research can influence the outcomes of said research. 

Feel free to search on the subreddit further; this topic has been discussed quite a few times (e.g. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/o7x4xu/is_economics_science/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/p5n8gg/to_what_extent_is_economics_a_science_to_what/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/lk3gnt/before_every_major_crisis_there_are_always_one_or/)) and there is a valuable discussion in the [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_methods#wiki_are_there_laws_of_economics.3F). Generally, the most simple answer to your feeling of discomfort is that, just because a science is complex and may make incorrect predictions, does not make it not a science. Think of meteorology, for example. Discussions between economists are usually not as principled as people think - they are mostly on whether the assumptions we make to draw conclusions are justified."

EXPLAIN TO ME HOW ARE DIVIDENDS WORTH IT?!,"Exponential growth; if you have one share and you reinvest the dividends every distribution, 1 share becomes 1.05 in a year, but as the multiplier uses the latest balance, you'd be earning dividends on 1.05 the second year instead of 1 (more if dividends are quarterly vs annual). Doesn't sound like much, but the multiplier effect is more evident after many years of dividend reinvestment."
Why aren’t loans the rich take out using stocks taxed?,"If you take out a loan for $1M, you’re getting the 1M cash as an asset and receiving a liability of 1M in debt. So the net change to your balance sheet is zero since they cancel each other out. There is nothing there to tax.

Stocks are used as a collateral on loans in the same way you can use your house as collateral. You don’t lose the house unless you default so you’re not realizing the gains made on your property. The same thing applies to any other asset that is used. You’re just telling the bank you have this so they can trust to loan you the money.

Welcome to the vampire economy,"This is an absolute garbage, ""where's my socialism"" post.  It's one thing to suggest that these companies are overvalued.  That's fine.  But to suggest that they aren't providing useful services?  To suggest that companies who are providing services that are in enormous demand are somehow predatory?  To suggest they need to be regulated and taxed into oblivion so that a central planner's idea of ""the greater good"" can form?  Let's protect the typewriter manufacturers and Encyclopedia salesman while we're at it.  Absolute garbage."
Honest Question: Are we in an echo chamber of index ETFs being the best investment product?,There’s nothing wrong with stock picking.

How will Amazon fall?,"I think this is a really interesting question!  The clearest analog to Amazon in the early 21st century may be the Sears Company in the late 19th century. And... Sears just went out of business in the last 5 years. Its business model wasn’t current for the last 30 years or so, but entrenched market positions can stay alive for a long time. 

By the time Sears failed, the economy had changed radically around it. (Several times!) My sense is that Amazon won’t ever fail *in this economy*— it will take some big changes in the economy that we can only guess at now. 

What changes might come? 

Nanotechnology and active assemblers would make the “shipping manufactured goods” business a dinosaur. 

AI-driven autonomous corporations that could manage their own logistics might decentralize the things that Amazon has done so well for us so far. 

Nearer-term, a congressionally mandated split-up separating the AWS cash cow from the steady smaller margins of Amazon proper might change its velocity, but probably not its market advantages. 

I’m curious what anybody else has to say!"
"Renter not allowing others to see home until the renter moves out, normal?","What about asking the renter to do a video walk through tour of the property?

What was your biggest investment mistake?,"Being too cheap. I wanted AMD when it was at ~2.50, but thought I'd wait until it went under 1$. Lost interest and thought $10 was too expensive. This while actively only buying their products on value propositions since 1998."
"ELI5: &lt;serious&gt; How does a business like Trump's golf courses/hotels that have been losing money for so long continue to be able to make payroll, yet many other businesses that run this kind of debt end up going out of business?","There are a few different phenomenon happening here that make something like this possible. It is important to start with the understanding that we are missing significant pieces of information that prevent any clear conclusions from being drawn on exactly what is happening. What I will lay out below is based on a general model, not a detailed understanding of any one specific organization's holdings.

The first key piece to understand is that a business can not make a profit and still make payroll. A business that has $1,000 in sales a year and $1,000 in expenses per year can continue operation without issue, they just aren't generating any profits that would then generate income taxes.

The second piece builds on the first. Among a businesses expenses are their debt payments. There is some complexity here in terms of tax treatment, but keeping it simple, any debt payments you are making reduce your potential profits.

The third piece is that in terms of real estate, those physical properties are generally going to appreciate in value over time. This has the effect of increasing equity (value of the property less any debt owed on the property), but has no effect on profits until the property actually changes hands.

The fourth piece connects the 2nd and 3rd. As a business pays down debts, they are increasing their equity in the property. Combining the appreciation (increase in value of the property) and the debt payments, you can have a business that is worth quite a bit of money because of the equity in the property, but is generating no annual profits (often intentionally). A business can build significant equity without ever generating a profit and then go to a bank, who will lend additional money on the existing equity of a property. The money raised from this debt can be used to fund ongoing expenses.

The fifth piece is specific tax treatments such as depreciation that allow a business to recognize largely paper expenses that produce favorable tax outcomes. The idea behind depreciation is good, when you build a building, it is going to degrade over time and be worth less than it was the day it was built. Stated more plainly, a new building built on the same piece of land is worth more than an old building on the same piece of land.

The last piece rolls up all of this together. We're hearing about the aggregated results of a large organization with several different properties and streams of income. Over time some of those properties may be sold (or part of them sold) and some of the businesses may generate some profits used to fund expenses from other business lines that allow a cycle of losing money from a tax standpoint to continue for a considerable period of time."
Is Supply and Demand a law that is only valid within our current economic system or is it an actual natural law?,"You might be interested in research into the market economies of cleaner fish for example: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2208-coral-reefs-operate-free-market-economy/

Humor: People assuming you don’t have money,"I was once backpacking on a South Pacific island. At the time I earned more than six figures, but when travelling alone, I like backpacking - you meet more peopleI decided to drink the last of my local currency and walk the 5k’s to the airport the next day (I had all day and it was flat, beautiful country, with a clear weather forecast). So off to bed with no cash - no problem. 

Next morning - torrential rain - fuck it, walk anyhow with rain coat. Was warm, so jot a huge problem - lounge access at the airport, so hot shower at the end. 

I stopped at a bus shelter for a break and the locals on their way to church asked what I was doing. 

“Walking to the airport as I’ve got no cash left for a cab/bus”. 

As they got on the bus the beckoned me on - they pooled their church change to pay my ticket to the airport - buses only take cash there. I have never been more touched by a group of people. I made a point of getting their names. 

The following week I made my one and only direct donation to a church. Their church. In their name. With a note “to say thank you for helping a stranger get out of the rain”. Best $1,000 I have ever spent. Got a nice letter and photo back from the pastor."

"Zillow Seeks to Sell 7,000 Homes for $2.8 Billion After Flipping Halt","&gt;The company acquired roughly 8,000 homes in the third quarter, according to an estimate by real estate tech strategist Mike DelPrete.

In case people didn't read the article. Seems like they bit off more than they could chew temporarily and are looking to unload basically everything they bought in Q3 to avoid holding costs on $2.8 B with no one available to renovate all those houses. 

Holding costs on that are probably about $7 MM a month. I'd guess they took a look at contractors being booked into 2022 and said they would rather try offloading to investors at cost than eat $20+ MM in interest before selling at cost."

Russian Stocks are not value,"Respectfully I disagree with this.  You are being too emotional and political.  By definition, value investing is mathematical.  You can model and add the appropriate political/war, etc... Metrics to anything.

At the end of the day, all the bullshit and war it all comes down to money.  Western governments will impose weak sanctions on Russia because it is in their economic interest too.  

They will post on their official twitters how much they support Ukraine, but it won't stop the flow of Russian Oil into countries like Germany who are absolutely dependent on it.  Even if the western governments grew a pair and implemented sanctions that bite, China, India and other countries will surely buy it.

Russia won't get cut off from SWIFT and Russian energy companies will still earn near record profits (along with all the other western energy companies with big investments in Russia i.e. BP)."
I'm seriously considering leaving nothing to my kid,"By the time you leave a big chunk to a child at death they are on average about 50-60 years old. If they are well set in their life it won’t make a meaningful difference. Instead, make a measured donation to them to help give them a bit of a head start. Ie pay for college (maybe leave them 10k of loans if you want to play the tough love card), consider a grant at 30 or so to help with a down payment.  

I think an ideal inheritance would be school with no debt and then 100-250k at around 30 to help launch and get a leg up in todays society (and brutal housing market) but then little else. It shows you care, but then you can spend the rest on yourself or charity and your kid still has to take care of business."
Maybe safe-haven stocks aren’t so safe after all?,"I think what you're missing is the degree of confidence in future earnings. 

Companies like PG or JNJ have very stable earnings streams, they sell essential goods and are (at least arguably) recession proof. In my opinion that's not enough reason to pay 30x earnings for a KO or PG that can only grow earnings at a low single digit rate for the foreseeable future, but that logic is WHY they're trading at premium.

Your comparisons to ""cheaper"" stocks are discretionary, consumer durables (AAPL, F) retail (TGT, BBY, BGFV) and financials (JPM, C) all of which are **highly cyclical** and will experience lower earnings, or possibly even losses, if the economy contracts. 

You're saying they look cheap based on the past 12 months but that doesn't tell you what they'll do if the economy contracts. They're cheaper because the market is discounting them based on uncertainty for the future.

While I appreciate the effort and spirit of this post, I think your DCFs are giving a false sense of precision because you're really comparing apples and oranges. 

Where the edge might be is finding a stock that is priced as if it were cyclical, but in fact will hold up better than people think."

"Citadel has hostages: explaining why the MOASS is taking so long, how the January spike was stopped, Robinhood's motives for the trading halt, and the mysterious silence of the SEC","Interesting article and thanks for taking the time to write it, but I respectfully disagree that there are any ""victims"" or ""hostages"" on their (mega rich, institutions) end. **TL;DR: I believe they're all colluding, the only variable is how close the co-operation is.**

I've worked in white collar for a long time now. If there's anything I've learned is that most, if not all, interactions  are fake and scripted to make them seem real and serious from an outsider's perspective. Contracts are signed but not adhered to. Promises are made but there's always failure to deliver. Disregarding company policies (as simple as writing passwords in plaintext emails or post-its) are widespread and frequent. Everything - all the policies, regulations, rules, legalese - is just ""theater"" for the outside world.

NDAs are more ""guidelines""... when someone leaves for a competitor, no matter if they were the janitor or C-level, I can 100% guarantee they do spill the beans on the previous company they work for. Usually they pass around files marked as ""INTERNAL ONLY, CONFIDENTIAL"" from their old company in their new one. This becomes increasingly true, the more tightly knit the industry is.

Personally, I have been making much more by selling CCs than holding shares because the number one problem I ran into is not knowing when to exit. Selling mid bull run seems stupid, so taking 50% gains when the stock is still running up is giving up gains, which results in holding longer, then eating a crash and panic selling.

Why is the Argentine economy so bad?,"&gt;Argentina also doesn’t struggle with crime and poverty or civil conflict the way certain other South American countries do, and from what I understand the population is relatively well educated compared to say Colombia or Brazil, so why does Argentina have a much worse economy than these countries? Does it stem from a lack of natural resources? Corruption? Just general mismanagement? Or are there other things I’m missing? And more importantly for the Argentinian people, what could be done to potentially break them out of this cycle?

Look at the history of the country, and it becomes clearer. It has been more than 90 years of chaos punctuated by violence. For most of the 20th century, the economy was in service to the military's power over the country, and when it wasn't, there is not sufficient expertise or stability politically to manage anyways.

Or, to put it another way: without political stability and the rule of law, economic stability is impossible over the long term."

"Since 1978, wages for the average worker have only increased 11.9%. Why?","It mostly has to do with the type of workers in the survey the EPI used.

However, it makes no real statement on the change in quality of life for the average worker or person.

[Real personal per-capita consumption](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A794RX0Q048SBEA) increased 120% in the same timeframe, which is to say that the average person/worker is much better off today than in 1978."

Buyer1 want to buy 5 AAPL for 124

Buyer2 want to buy 4 AAPL for 125

Seller1 want to sell 10 AAPL for 128

Seller2 want to sell 2 AAPL for 129

and so on. It is just and (almost) endless stream and if ordered in a way that you have all quotes lined up with the highest buy order on top and the lowest sell order on the is called an (ordered) book. The difference between the highest buy (125) and the lowest sell order (128) is called the spread. In the above example, the spread is 3 (its usually much smaller).

Now two things can happen: accidentally they meet and match, like:

Seller3 want to sell 3 AAPL @ 125

That ends with a trade Seller3 selling 3 AAPL for 125 to Buyer2.

 or someone comes in and says explicitly ""I want to accept Seller1's offer"" (technically there is not much difference).

Now as everyone can change their quotes or remove them again in split seconds this fluctuates the whole time. People on the market adjust the prices for a lot of reasons, be it expectations on the company or on the market trying to simply game each other. You can see this in action in the link u/daybyter2 On the left you see the book with the prices and amounts and on the right the trades which are done.

Now what is the price of AAPL? Well, that's relative, you can say it is the last trade being done or the average of the last few trades or the middle of the spread...

And yes, with each trade you move the market/price every time a bit (or by a lot if you move a lot of money/shares). Though it is not directly visible, mostly as there are specialized companies (Market Makers) around, which fill the gaps immediately (microseconds).

Just sold all my ARK positions.,"I am not, have not, and never plan to be in any of the ARK funds however, the decision to sell now is likely just the opposite of what you should be doing - this is modelling ""dumb money"" of buy high and sell low.  If we find the fed is not going to be agressive on rate hikes (I dont think they will) and inflation starts to cool a little in the coming months then there is a good possibilty you are near or at the bottom for their funds.  Not my money, not my decision but I never sell low when I have any kind of conviction in my investments and I don't buy without conviction."
My country (Brazil) is considering allowing people to hold foreign currency in their bank accounts. What are the pros and cons of this?,"Seems like a strange thing to have been illegal in the first place. Holding foreign currency among masses most likely won’t have much of an effect in my opinion, since I doubt many people will attempt some kind of speculation on foreign currency. I’m case Brazil decides to implement policies that might cause inflationary problems, secondary currency such as US dollar might become second used currency in the country, escaping the loss of value on domestic currency. Apart from that I don’t see a scenario where this would be significant policy in terms of economic impact. But maybe I’m missing something."
"HR pulled me to demand proof of a degree I never claimed to have, (they knew I only had a HS diploma) and now they want to cut my pay.","Tread lightly here, sometimes you'll get audited by HR because they are looking for reasons to cut you from the company. Obviously do yourself the due diligence of figuring out why it's just you with the pay reduction but I'd also start looking for other jobs in case they are trying to nudge you out. "
Why can't money just be created and used without having to be financed or paid back,"Because the point of being paid to construct a better school is that I get real consumption for it, not simply money. Increased money printing devalues money when it’s holders go and try to buy goods and services with it themselves.

Inflation is also a sort of tax—by reducing the value of existing money, you are reducing what it’s current holders can get for exchanging it. With taxes, however, you can target who is taxed in a statutory way. With an inflation “tax,” you cannot. 

The point is that the government cannot simply get goods and services for nothing. In the end, money is a promise of future consumption, and a weaker promise is less valuable."

"Why did Brazil fail economically, but China, Korea and Japan succeeded?","A variety of factors have contributed to Brazil's stagnant productivity. I will mention three of them which are detailed in [this article](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/08/24/brazil-increase-productivity-share-prosperity#:~:text=Brazil's%20low%20productivity%20rate%20is,sector%20and%20openness%20to%20trade) by the World Bank. Firstly, infrastructure quality is quite poor in Brazil. [According to the World Bank,](https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/h2cf9f9f8?country=BRA&amp;indicator=536&amp;viz=line_chart&amp;years=2007,2017) Brazil ranked 108 out of 137 countries in terms of overall infrastructure quality, and it went down 11 spots between 2007 and 2017. Second is the ease of doing business. In 2019, [Brazil](https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/country/b/brazil/BRA.pdf) was ranked 124 out of 198 countries. It took roughly 338 days dealing with construction permits alone. So much regulation is incredibly restrictive and hurts investments into Brazil, and discourages innovation immensely. Thirdly is access to financing for businesses. Brazil has high interest rates for businesses, which are a result of its policy of wanting to have a balanced budget, but as a result, this is hurting business investment and innovation, and therefore indirectly productivity growth. [It ranks third globally](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/lending_interest_rate/) in how high its interest rates are."
"For those receiving government benefits for the first time, particularly those from high incomes.","Australia's welfare system is poorly means tested, it's far too generous to age pensioners with substantial assets and income, and far too cruel to Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients.

The Age Pension is the single largest item in the federal budget, there is nothing else the government spends more on.

A couple on the age pension can have over **$1 million** in assets (seriously) **not** including the value of their home and still receive a part pension.

A couple can earn over **$106k per annum** and still receive a part pension.

Of course your house is entirely exempt from the age pension assets test. Most people are aware of this. People seem to be mostly unaware that pensioners can have **over $1 million dollars in the bank!!!** or be earning **over $100k/annum!!!** and still be receiving a part pension.

The Age Pension costs over $50 billion/annum. Combined jobseeker payments of Newstart and Youth Allowance are approximately $11 billion.

People have a moralistic view, about the perceived deserving vs undeserving poor. They think of pensioners as nice helpless nannas, and the unemployed as lazy drug addicts. But you don't have to be a nice person, or have worked hard, or do shit to receive the age pension. 

If we could take away this false emotion, on any objective financial assessment, Newstart recipients should have a lot more help, and wealthy pensioners a lot less."

Which offer is better 50k Frankfurt vs 60k Luxembourg vs 87k Basel,"* 50.000€ in Germany is [about 2.640€](https://www.handelsblatt.com/brutto-netto-rechner/) net.
* 87.000CHF in Basel is [about 5.470CHF](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/welcome-center/services-and-downloads/salary-calculator.html) net, depending on your employer's pension scheme. However, ""net"" in Switzerland is before health insurance which you would need to deduct as well.
* I don't know anything about Luxembourg, but 60.000€ seems to be [about ~~2.460€~~ 3.517€](https://www.calculatrice.lu/calculator) net~~, so the tax isn't really that low? Maybe I'm missing something.~~ [I confused monthly and annual salary.]

Switzerland is not cheap, but rent in Basel is somewhat reasonable. Depending on your needs, you can get a 1-room flat for less than 1.000CHF. Also, you can go to Germany or France for grocery shopping. I believe you will have the most cash left at the end of the month in Basel. Say if you spend 1.000 on rent, 500 on healthcare, then you can spend another 1.200 and still have more money left than you would even *earn* in Germany.

And since this is a personal finance community: It should be noted that Switzerland has, generally speaking, no capital gains tax for private investors, and that US ETFs are available.

Also, if it matters: Basel is ""closest to home"" geographically speaking. There are multiple direct trains a day taking you to Milan in about 4 hours."

Noah Smith AMA: Economics blogger at Noahpinion,"1. Up until maybe a month or two ago, quite a number of pretty prominent economists had been arguing that ARP did not contribute to inflation. With the common consensus beginning to roll around to the point that US stimulus (including but not limited to ARP) likely *did* exacerbate inflation, why do you think so many generally smart people got it so wrong? Did motivated reasoning lead some to believe inflation was forever dead and gone? Bad luck?Or was there a deeper theoretical error?

If so, what might we learn from that error going forward - since even the Fed now claims to not fully understand inflation

Where did the houses go?,"""Where do they go"" is an appropriate question, with the wrong subject. Of course houses don't just move. But people do.

To put it a bit differently, the housing shortage was never about there not being enough housing in general, but there not being enough housing *in certain (high demand) areas*.

And it's not a particularly new phenomenon. It's generally true that most of these places have very small vacancy rates though.

There are certainly factors that exacerbate this temporarily, but broadly speaking it's the result of urbanisation that has gone on for decades if not centuries. A tad less broadly speaking, it happens because the influx of people in the areas where people want to move to, like New York, Boston, etc. is much greater than the increase in housing supply and has been for a while. Demand goes up, supply doesn't, you get what people perceive as a shortage.

This has indeed slowed down a tad during the pandemic, but we're just seeing the trend continue."

GME Overnight Pajama Party Megathread,"Alright fam, here’s my thoughts (disclosure, I’m a retard, but I’ve got a few wrinkles, a JD, and some basic addition and subtraction skills):

* GME float is roughly 47M shares. (For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).

* The number of shares short is still above 68M. 

* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. 

* This is 155% of the float. 

* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)

A number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That’s roughly 6.5M users. And, that’s only RH users. Let’s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). 

If we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that’s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that’s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it’s 5 shares, that’s 85% of the float. I don’t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. 

What does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. 

That means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail’s shares. They have to have your bananas. 

And, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That’s the squeeze. 

Don’t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk. We have no ongoing expense of ownership. The market made sure of that. So, let their actions slit their own throats. 

Don’t sell.  If you do, buy back in. Don’t let up. 

And, don’t forget, I’m an idiot. You probably shouldn’t listen to anything I say. 

(Finally, if someone has better information, numbers, or analysis - correct me.)"

Just got 1.8M....now what...,"I would just put whatever I can into tax advantaged accounts, then put the rest in a brokerage and buy a low fee index fund. It will go up and down, but it could kick out around $50,000+ in dividends each year. If you don't touch the dividends and let it grow for a while you'll be pretty rich in the end. You could use the dividends (or other income) to continue maxing out the tax advantaged accounts each year.

If you do pick a financial advisor make sure they have a fiduciary agreement, this means they are legally obligated to act in your best interest rather than...say... the interest of their own pockets.

"Axis Bank has suddenly decided to raise its charges and minimum balance requirements to preposterous levels, what other bank do you suggest?","SBI is anyways a good choice in comparison to other public banks. I will however, add something which might not be relevant to this threa. Feel free to ignore it.

I have 3 bank accounts: ICICI, Indian Bank (Allahabad Bank) and PayTM Payments Bank. I have a wealth account with ICICI so almost everything is free except for debit card fees. Indian Bank because I have a locker with them and PayTM Payments Bank because of FDs and very smooth payments experience.

ICICI Bank is the oldest and in 19 years I have not faced any single issue. For me this is the primary account. Indian Bank is pathetic. Bad customer care, bad mobile app which never works and bad branch experience. PayTM Payments Bank is a delight and I keep only 1 lakhs (as it is the limit) for expense payments (UPI, NEFT, IMPS). 

ICICI bank does not charge for SMS yet (my wife has a normal savings account) but they do have 10K limit. Indian Bank has Rs. 500 limit and PayTM Bank is free except for debit card fees, if you want a physical card.

I can vouch for ICICI and PayTM Bank as I never had a problem with them.

-----------

These are the signs to come. All private banks will be increasing their service charges and decreasing their interest on savings instruments (heard it from a bank manager) as RBI has tightened the noose and has asked all banks to make digital payments free for all. 

The safest option right now, for someone who does not want to pay lot of charges, are public sector banks. But there are trade offs."
.1% problem,"This is why I struggle to see the value in staying in very nice hotels...

Buffett &lt;-&gt; OXY?,"It's a bit of a contrarian bet in my opinion. 

There's a strong narrative out there that fossil fuels are going away in the next 20-40 years, but even if every personal vehicle is electrified by 2040 there are a ton of applications for petroleum that aren't going anywhere (e.g. anything made of plastic, aerospace, heavy transport, etc.). I think we'll see oil and gas hang around longer than people think on the basis of its affordability and energy density relative to weight compared to other sources of fuel.

With regards to the earnings, oil and gas is a notoriously cyclical business. When oil prices are low (e.g. 2019 and 2020), they lose money, and when prices are high they rake it in hand over fist. OXY is a profitable company with a moat in the form of the upfront infrastructure investments and leasing rights they hold, and it trades at a discounted valuation due to market fears."
When to tell children about inheritance they will receive from third party,"No real advice but I wish you luck. That kind of money at 18 is just a recipe for trouble but I'm guessing you are well aware of that.

That said I cannot image having the drive to give a damn about high school if I knew that I could just walk away. Honestly most adults would struggle if that was given to them so expecting an 18 year old to handle it well is just unfair."

"I realized when people start calling warren buffet dumb, well we are in a bubble","Issue is many do not know what they are i.e investor or trader or a bit of both. Whatever buffet says applies to an investor and that too with heavy cash (or slowly accumulate with discipline), (and/or can sit tight for long term). When you deal heavy cash, suddenly your focus is 1. To sleep peacefully 2. To not have to log in every second and watch graph 3. To not to worry about news. His first job is not to find a multi bagger but to retain the same value of investment. You have to invest in a stock that will be less volatile but also multi bagger and obv it will take years but that's the person who should listen to buffet. 

Amazon, tesla are selling hope. And they portray as they are too big to fail. If and when things go wrong retail investors will be the last ones to know. The worry is for investor, not trader (i consider under an year holding as trader)

You have 1000 and want to hold a stock from an industry you don't know, you can go ahead. You've a million but you won't hold more than an year, go ahead. But you have a million and want to hold for 3-5 years, you better make sure the value is retained and do your dd so it will be multibagger. Buffet is for them and only for them.

An investor creates wealth. A trader creates capital.

Would it be a good idea to link minimum wage to inflation?,"To answer the question in the title, maybe. It depends on what you would take to be the objective of minimum wage policy. 

One possible objective you could have in mind for minimum wage policy is just to use it to offset employers' monopsony power in low wage labor markets (so, an efficiency maximizing / employment maximizing goal). In this world, probably, inflation indexing is the wrong call. For one, the amount of monopsony power in low wage labor markets might change over time, making the initial real minimum wage possibly too high or too low. For two, for a fixed quantity of monopsony power, probably the efficiency maximizing optimal minimum wage will rise at a rate closer to that of nominal productivity growth (or median wage growth) - making the inflation rate too slow a growth rate.

Another objective might involve setting a particular minimum standard of living for workers for normative reasons. In this case, I guess inflation rate indexing would be optimal.

Another issue to consider is one related to the legislative process. Policy makers might be interested in setting the maximum minimum wage before notable negative employment effects kick in. But, probably, nobody knows exactly what that minimum wage level is in advance. In principle, policy makers could just experiment with the minimum wage until they found the optimal one. But if they can't adjust the minimum wage frequently, they might just set an ambitious one and then reckon that inflation will take care of things if they set it too high. So giving policy makers the option to set an ambitious starting minimum wage that then fades out until it can be adjusted later after evaluation may be a good idea in some political contexts."

Why is job automation perceived so negatively?,"I have written a few papers on labour market automation and I am of the opinion that it really boils down to a psychological bias and is not really explainable within economic theory. 

First, fear that technology will make people obsolete has been a feature of society for thousands of years. First written record is Aristotle, but there's evidence it goes back to around the time of the invention of the wheel.

Second, we can't know what new jobs technology will facilitate or create... But we have some idea of what labour won't be needed anymore. Loss aversion (the phenomenon that people value losing something at twice the value of gaining a similarly real-value thing) plays a huge role on the fear of technological change.

Housing and Real Estate Posts are becoming Toxic,"Your observation about the behavior around RE investment versus other avenues is actually rooted in how little knowledge the average poster actually has about investments in general.

They don't fight very hard because they know if anyone takes a peek under the hood, most of their knowledge is just surface level garbage regurgitated by everyone else.

With housing, it's different. People think, ""I own a house, or know people who own a house, or have lived in houses. I know houses!"" This, coupled with their emotional stake in the market, makes them fight harder than ever to justify their position (whether bull or bear). There is also understandably a ton of emotional spillover resulting in comments around morality, ethics, and very little to do with true ROI.

Doesn’t hiding salary/compensations fundamentally hinder an efficient labor market?,"Complete information is a basic assumption for the perfect market. If I just take your title into account the answer is a simple yes.

As this sub's goal is to improve economic understanding, I want to clarify some things you mentioned in the second paragraph.

Just because both parties ageee to something it does not automatically have to be fair (one can't even ultimately define what actually is fair because this depends on political views which must not be discussed here). As a player competing in a market where prices are hidden and many buyers do not know how do determine whether a website is that good, we're dealing with asymmetric information. As you get more experienced and strike more deals, you get a better feeling for prices even in hidden markets.

You as a rational player should not assume that the deals you spot are efficient. You can try to convince the buyer by writing an offer or getting drunk with their marketing team or similar. This of course causes costs (time you could use to work on other things, money for booze and transportation) and has a risk of not leading to a deal. If net profit times probability surpasses the costs (minus the benefit from a good night with drunk marketing people) you should go for it.

Edit: Spelling"
Anyone else think that the idea of retiring as a “millionaire” doesn’t seem like a big thing or achievement anymore?,"In a sense yes, having a net worth of a million for retirement right now and in the future isn’t going to look or feel “rich”. However, it still is well off and majority of people even in America will never be a millionaire let alone the whole world. If your goal is to drive expensive cars, live in a mansion, buy a boat and travel whenever you want, you’re going to need to be worth $10-$20 million+. That’s just how it is. 

That’s why when I invest I always account inflation for my investment (subtract 3% from whatever my yearly return is).

With all that being said, you’re looking at life through the scope of America, but you forget that there’s hundreds of other countries where having $1 million is going to give you that “millionaire” lifestyle. Many Americans move overseas for retirement because they can get more bang for their buck. As a scope of reality, an average apartment in Thailand in a populated expat area only costs a few hundred dollars a month. Food and everything else is crazy cheap as well. 

If you want to feel like a millionaire with a million dollars then I’d suggest to move to South America, Eastern Europe or Asia"

Thought experiment: If humans were only a 1/4 of our size; do you think we will have similar economics?,"Biologist here, so no economist but maybe some expertise relevant to my speculation. Firstly to scale our resource consumption down by 1/4 would probably not be achieved by making us 1/4 of the size, because biology doesn't scale that way. Smaller animals have relatively more surface area, and an animal 1/4 the size of a human would probably consume more than 1/4 the calories. Lots of other things wouldn't scale the same. Brain size for instance - while certain parts of brains scale with body size, there's no reason to think an animal 1/4 the size of a human could do the same amount of abstract thought with 1/4 the brain tissue. Our size relative to other animals and plants would also be different - animals would be huge relative to us, capable of moving huge loads, and much more dangerous, so one could imagine that effecting how useful they are in warfare.

As far as the meat of the question goes though - what if we consumed 1/4 the resources, it's worth noting that according to some (I gather by no means all) historians, many societies were trapped in a resource limited 'malthusian trap' prior to the industrial revolution. The limits of that trap would still presumably have been reached by our hobbit people, but presumably at higher population densities - however little resources we consume, we'd eventually have increased population sizes till we hit some limiting resource, and that would lead to scarcity and many of the same things that happened in the real world."

Oil Profits Not Going To Capex,"I'm a finance guy who's been in Oil &amp; Gas for 12 years. 

You're correct. Prices are very likely to remain above $70, despite all of the calls for a major recession. People often don't take into account the [serious inventory shortages](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=WCRSTUS1&amp;f=W) that the SPR releases have been papering over this year. We've drained over half of the SPR, and crude inventories are still at multi-decade lows. And almost none of this is due to electrification of cars and trucks. Ukraine has had a very big effect on this because we have been exporting more crude to Europe in order to help offset the Russian crude embargoes.

Even though it was painful to endure 2020, COVID ended up being a a much needed shock that the industry needed - especially for upstream firms. Prior to COVID, balance sheets were notoriously over-levered, and capital budgets were often pegged in excess of 1.5-2.0x the prior year's operating cash flow. This meant that, although EBITDA could grow (and keep the company's debt profile under control), equity investors would see little result, as companies were recklessly growing volumes in order to service all of the bonds, term loans and revolving lines of credit that the companies had taken out in the 2010's. 

Part of this was needed, as that decade was really dedicated to acquiring and testing out methods in the Permian Basin. The industry also learned the hard way that shale plays in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus and Bakken are much tougher to realize good ROIC, and so a lot of capital was wasted trying to perfect very imperfect geological formations. Nowadays, most E&amp;P firms have retrenched into a much more capital-friendly basin in the Permian. The methods employed in the Permian are much more efficient because of wider pay zones (geological formations with oil-bearing rock), cleaner drilling rights (biggest landowners usually own thousands of blocks of acreage, making land acquisition costs lower), and more efficient drilling/completion scheduling (2 mile lateral wells, and more tightly packed wells on a 640-acre drilling unit).

So while the Permian set-up phase took a decade to play out, and cost the companies dearly in debt and equity costs, COVID ended up being a huge boon for the industry for a few reasons:

1) Easy Fed policy meant that the industry could refinance their oftentimes 6-7%-yielding bonds into far more manageable 3-4% bonds. Same with bank loans. Across the industry, interest rates plummeted, and bondholders were willing to exchange their notes for lower rates and longer maturities (thanks, Fed!). This dramatically eased the burden that companies faced every quarter when making interest payments and also maintaining debt/EBITDA covenants, which were also eased in these amendments.

2) With debt service costs now better managed, as well as a capital-light 2020, E&amp;P firms started realizing very significant cash flows from existing oil &amp; gas production. The introduction of the vaccines in November 2020 - only 6 months after prices had plummeted - also saved the industry's bacon. This meant that the economy could reopen sooner, and drive up oil &amp; gas demand. Prices quickly rebounded up to a survivable $60-$70 / $3-$4 level, which, coupled with dramatically reduced capex budgets, meant that firms could simply collect cash flow and clean up their balance sheets even further. We've seen Debt/EBITDA ratios drop from 5.0x in 2019 to &lt;3.5x in most cases (and even lower for the healthier firms like DVN and PXD). 

3) The greater spending discipline has also helped to stabilize prices at &gt;$70/Bbl, since firms aren't chasing high prices as overaggressively as they did in the past. Remember, they don't have massive debt costs to service in order to stay in business anymore, so for the first time in a long time, companies are actually free to spend at their discretion, instead of feeling that they have to play catch-up with their lenders.

So long story short, COVID cleaned up oil firms' balance sheets dramatically, and the quick vaccine development kept prices up to healthy levels. The industry is completely flush with cash and is returning it to long-waiting shareholders after they endured decades of overspending. Assuming that this discipline holds (and we'll see what happens as interest rates rise sharply), firms should be able to keep drilling capital light in the next few years and keep prices high enough to protect their bottom lines.

Vitalik Buterin Introduction

“I was born in 1994 in Russia and moved to Canada in 2000, where I went to school. I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.

In 2011, searching for a new purpose in life, I discovered Bitcoin. At first, I was skeptical, and did not understand how it could possibly have value without physical backing. But slowly I became more and more interested. I started writing for a blog called Bitcoin Weekly initially at a meek wage of $1.5 per hour, and soon with Mihai Alisie cofounded Bitcoin Magazine.

In 2012, I entered the University of Waterloo; in 2013 I realized that crypto projects were taking up 30h/week of my time, so I dropped out. I went around the world, explored many crypto projects, and finally realized that they were all too concerned about specific applications and not being sufficiently general - hence the birth of Ethereum, which has been taking up my life ever since.”

"Are ""the rich getting richer"" and ""the poor getting poorer""?","TL;DR It depends on who you mean by the poor. The global poor have been getting ""richer"", the Western poor not so. In both cases, the rich are definitely getting richer.

The other comments seem to be arguing about [Thomas Pickety's work](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006) on inequality in the West. That rightly gets a lot of attention, but it's still very much [debated by top-economists](https://www.amazon.com/After-Piketty-Agenda-Economics-Inequality/dp/0674237889/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=after+picketty&amp;qid=1605702524&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1).

I think that this focus on the West also misses out some really important points.

There is a famous graph in economics called the ""[elephant curve](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/elephant-curve-world-inequality)"" (image [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=9356)). Imagine a big ""hump"" (showing how the global poor have benefited), then a dip (showing the global middle-class has stagnated), and then a ""trunk"" (showing how the global rich have *really* benefited).

To your question, it thus all depends on who you mean when you say ""the poor"". If you think about it on a global level then poor people are unambiguously better off now than 40 years ago (i.e. the rise of countries like China and India saw the biggest ever reduction in human poverty).

But if you think about it on a national level -- i.e. the poor in the US and Europe (who might are still middle-class on a global level) -- then your friend seems to be onto something. They have hardly seen any wage gains since 1980 (and are much worse off in other ways). So there is a case to say they are getting ""poorer"".

The quite shocking thing is just how much the top 1% has gained in comparison. They captured almost 27% of all global growth! Whatever way you look at it, the rich have definitely been getting richer.

On another point, there is an interesting ""[Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)"" in inequality. It says that inequality can rise in every individual country but at the same time decrease globally. This is because developing countries are catching up to the Global North and many more people live in those countries. Gapminder has quite a good [interactive visualization](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=1987;;&amp;chart-type=mountain) of this.

If you want to learn more, check out [Branko Milanovic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-Inequality-New-Approach-Globalization/dp/067498403X) \-- his book gives you a really good overview of all the major trends.

"How does a $21,000 car minus $5,500 equal $30,600?","Used to sell cars, so thought I'd try to get you some feedback from someone in the industry. Not me, but a friend of mine in the industry has been a finance manager for decades (and not a sketchy one; has been honored with some top customer service awards nationwide over his career), and is currently and F&amp;I manager at a Honda dealership.  Sent him the link to your post in case he had any good insight for you, and he's given me permission to share his response here.  I've also included links to the screenshots his system gave him when he inputted your data:
""580 score. Rate in 20 to 25% range. 72 months, compounded annually, 30k total payback is right.
Not the dealers fault. 580 is sub prime. No major bank wants it.
Why is it 580? Slow pays? Repo? Charge offs? The repo risk rate is high, then so is the interest rate.""

He says he's had 2 like this this month, and only one bank woukd take them (which I can speak to as the case 99% of the time when I was in sales) and the bank made all the money, not the dealership.  It's worth noting that The REAL profit is on used cars, not new, so the real opportunity for the dealership to make money on this deal is on the back end, selling extended warrantees &amp; upselling on after-market products.  So they're not trying to rip you off on the payments, it's just what the bank is demanding to make the sale on the front end.  The dealership WANTS to sell you a car, and they WANT to get a bank to approve it, so they can make money on the back end in F&amp;I.  

If you do seek a line of credit through your bank, your chances are much better through a credit union than a traditional banking institution.  Honestly, given your credit, I'd consider a less expensive, used vehicle that maintains it's resale value well &amp; is always in demand (Toyota, Honda, Subaru).  Make all your payments on time for 1-2 years, and THEN trade it in for a more expensive car once you've boosted your credit score.  Hope this helps!

I agree with you - it’s tremendously hard. I grew up poor, white, and molested (outright raped, actually), on open farm land (not in the hood), and the psychology you mention in point two still gave me an uphill battle for six extra years. I absolutely believe it would’ve been even harder for me if I were black (and had systemic racism working against me) and if I lived in the hood (with more people around me to injure me further or ignore my pain, my trust in humanity would’ve eroded even further). 
   I know it *can* be done. You can get out and find a safe, sane, decent life for yourself where you can pay your bills, hold a good job, and have a loving family of your own.

But one last rape by a “friend” I trusted left me pregnant, and I (remember that I was jaded by trauma psychology), I kept the baby out of spite.

Is it true that Marxism has been relegated to philosophy and there are few economists who take it seriously?,"It is generally true that economists tend to waive off Marxist critique in their analysis, in no small part because of the labour theory of value issue. However, Marxist economics is still an active albeit small field in the broader field of economics, and some academics are still active in publishing work analyzing modern economic outcomes with a Marxist perspective. The one I know the best is David Harvey, who has published (not sure if peer-reviewed) critiques of global neoliberal economics. To some extent, Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the 21st Century* incorporates a data element that is missing in much of the work of Marx and his contemporaries, and offers a slate of mechanisms that are more in line with modern economic theory that explain similar patterns predicted by Marx, including the accumulation of wealth over time and potential disruptors of that process under a capitalist framework.

I would argue that Marxism is mostly dismissed in economics because it hasn't been updated in the language of economics in quite some time. When Marx was writing, economics was a less rigorous and mathematical discipline, a change which didn't occur until Alfred Marshall in the early 20th century. Since that time, the Marxist literature has mostly focused either on vague criticisms of capitalism or specific analyses of productive processes and the qualitative aspects of capitalist production. (See for example Adorno's ""Culture Industry"") That's not to say that Marxism does not provide valuable insights or criticisms of modern economic theory, it just hasn't been done in a way that is consistent with the economics discipline in the 21st century."

How to win friends and influence a small city,"It's always easier to be a small fish in a big pond than vice versa. I assume you are moving to a regular town, not some flashy suburb.

And not only for you - your kids might soon be labeled at school and that os usually not a good thing.

A close friend of mine was in a similar predicament - he made his fortune in IT, moved to a smaller town and slowly started integrating in community. But to do that he basically moved most of his assets in a revocable trust, deleted as much information about himself from internet and never told anyone local about his wealth. He covers his expenses from a trust, drives a very modest car and lives in a cute, but unimposing house. That didn't stop him contributing millions to local charities anonymously though. 

He is now a well respected member of a local community, very few know who he is and what he does, he never ""bought"" people's respect, it just came from his action and good heart.

ELI5 request: Where did the money for Budget 2020 come from? Who did the Australian Government borrow from and who do they actually owe money to? How will this money be paid off?,"Excellent question! As you alluded to, the federal budget is quite different to a household budget. Before diving into your questions, I just want to touch on the difference between **Fiscal** and **Monetary** Policy. **Fiscal Policy** is the use of government revenue and expenditure to affect a country's economy. By increasing or decreasing government revenue (e.g. taxes, tariffs) or expenditure (e.g. infrastructure programs, social welfare), a government can influence the aggregate demand, and the rates of saving and investment in an economy. **Monetary Policy** is the use of the money supply (e.g. interest rates, “money printing”) to affect an economy, and is most often used to affect the inflation rate of an economy. I bring this up because Fiscal Policy is the purview of the *Federal Government,* while Monetary Policy is the purview of the *Reserve Bank of Australia*, which acts independently from the Federal Government. The Federal Budget that was delivered this week is an example of *Fiscal Policy,* and as such, the Australian Federal government is unable to just crank out more bank notes as they wish. Every dollar needs to be accounted for by government revenue, or a loan needs to be taken out.

**Where did the money come from?**

If government expenditure exceeds government revenue (e.g. money raised by taxes), the federal government needs to borrow the difference. They do this by selling [exchange-traded Australian Government Bonds (eAGBs)](https://www.australiangovernmentbonds.gov.au/). These securities are initially sold on the ASX to investors, with the money raised by the sale going to the federal government (similar to a company undergoing an IPO). These bonds can then be bought and sold between investors. The latest bond sale that I am aware of was in August, when the government sold[ $21 billion dollars worth of bonds](https://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/government-bond-record-smashed-as-aofm-set-to-print-21bn-20200826-p55pep) (that is, the government took out a $21 billion loan, which was added to the government debt).

**Who did the Australian Government borrow from and who do they owe money now?**

This is actually kind of difficult to give an exact answer for. Under the *Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Act 2009* the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is required to publish the beneficial ownership, by region, of Australian government securities. However, the AOFM is unable to compel custodians or nominees to reveal their beneficiaries. For example: the AOFM can know that a bunch of Australian Bonds were brought by a mutual fund based in the USA, but can’t know how many of the fund members are private US residents, US institutional investors, foreign investors etc. [You can find the data they publish here](https://www.aofm.gov.au/data-hub). 47% of Australian debt is owned by identified beneficiaries, while 53% is owned by custodian or nominee companies. Of the identified 47%, regional ownership consists of: Australia (33.5%); Asia (6.5%); Europe (3.5%); North America (3.5%).

**How will this money be paid off?**

It will be paid via government revenue. [The Government’s 2019-20 budget estimated interest repayments approx $16.6 billion for that financial year](https://budget.gov.au/2019-20/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs6.pdf); in a year where [the government raised $505.52 billion in revenue.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-03/federal-budget-2019-sliced-and-diced-interactive/10959808?nw=0#revenue/breakdown/2020/other-purposes) The point here is that interest repayments make up about 3% of total government spending. In the 2019-2020 budget, the government paid $16.6 billion in interest, but earned $39 billion in non-taxation receipts (e.g. dividends from government owned investments, sales of goods and services)... so the tax cuts announced will hardly affect our ability to pay our debts.

Since following this strategy I have not had a loss on a symbol that i have opened in the past 6 months and am almost out or break even on any that I opened prior to that.  Currently I am outperforming all the major indices over 12 / 6 / and 3 months.  While i am not going to get rich in a day I do believ that after i move my other 150k in investments over that in 10 years I will have enough to be comfortable and within the next three years i could sell my business and trading be the only thing I do.

Account size 35000

Usage for options is around 15000

Trades per week 5-10

DTE 7-180 (see above sometimes you have to go far out to cover a loss but you still have to believe in the stock)


Edit: PS if you dont believe in a stock anymore GTFO (Get the F*** Out!!!)

Edit: Fixed terrible mobile formatting since someone thought i am making 15000 trades per week.

Edit: 

 I have had a lot of people ask me how I find the stocks to collect premium on. 

To clarify, my stategy is long to medium term hold.  I use premiums for three things.  

1) CSP: Aquire stock that I want to own but is not quite in my price target.  In this case I don not care if i get assigned or not.  If i get assigned then I get the stock at a price i am comfortable with.  If I get to 50% profit or 40% for at least two days in a row I close the position.  NOBODY LOSES MONEY TAKING A PROFIT.

2) CC Type 1: Stock that I am profitable on and want to keep in my portfolio.  I am selling OTM here hopefully enough to keep the stock.  If I get assigned and I still believe in the stock at that price I buy it again and start over.  AGAIN NOBODY LOSES MONEY TAKING A PROFIT.

3) CC Type 2: Stock that I used to believe in or still believe in long term but I am in the red.  This is where my DTE can get up to the 180 days.  I am looking for the highest %/day premium available.  My only goal here is either breaking even or profiting and exiting the stock to redeploy capital.  I have been fortunate to not need to be in this position for more than about three months on any stock so far but very well could be shoveling dirt out of a hole for much longer.  There ins another strategy I also use here which is cost averageing down and selling and shorter term DTE to exit. 

I am currently doing this on SLI. I decided I wanted lithium exposure exactly 15 days before a proposed class action lawsuit against them.  I started at 9.84 cost average.  Sold my normal call that was straight to in the money and wanted more stock so I sold a put.  The next day the trend was down for no reason. Stock continued the fall and I closed my call at normal profits and was assigned on the put.  New cost average 9.17.

I have sold two more calls to average down to 8.76 but then the stock got hammered again.  I want out so I purchased 200 more shares and averaged down to 7.855.  I then sold 4 calls at 7.5 april 14 for 440 total premium averaging down to 6.755.  Ar this point as long as the stock maintains 6.76 or better though expiration I get out of this trade only losing time.  In a perfect world 4/14 rolls around and the stock closes at 8.59.  Oh and if it goes to 5 I will chase it again until  I believe the stock is done and take my bruises."
Is a stock market crash like the ones in 1929 and 2008 impending?,"1929 and 2008 were both financial crises, which doesn’t just mean “a very bad recession” but actually has a specific meaning.

1929 initially started as a market decline on a similar path to todays (though on a much shakier ground because of lack of regulation). When the market did decline, however, the Federal Reserve made all the wrong moves, abandoning credit lines and causing a moderate recession to turn into a bad one. This bad recession caused a domino effect-like bank runs because savings weren’t protected. Combined with some natural issues (like the dust bowl) this turned a bad recession into a depression. 

This would not happen today because every person with a minor in Econ knows this is the exact opposite of how the Fed should behave, and we have policies in place to prevent things like bank runs. 

2008 was the result of a fundamentally flawed credit market, one that could have absolutely brought down the entire world and probably be worse than 1929. Luckily, we learned the lessons of 1929 and the Fed acted much more aggressively-chairman Ben Bernanke got the nickname “Helicopter Ben” because he circled over the economy injecting stimulus in it. This walked us back and turned a potentially catastrophic Greater Depression into an extremely strong recession. 

Our speculation is worth what you paid for it, but to most economists the fear is more like a late ‘70s/early ‘80s stagflationary environment than 1929 or 2008. Supply chain shocks and high inflation a financial crisis has not yet made.

As far as timing goes, there’s no point speculating in what things will look like 5 or 6 years from now. 5 years is an eternity in an economic cycle."

How does Costco measure if their $5 chickens are an effective loss leader?,"You basically answered the question yourself. There are a bunch of ways to measure if a loss leader is worth the cost, none of which are perfect. If we introduce $5 chickens in this store, does that increase overall sales in this particular store? To know if the increase is because of the loss leader or just because of natural sales growth, you compare that store with other similar stores where you did't introduce the loss leader (A/B Testing). Yes, you have to control for numerous factors, but that's always true in empirical research. 

If you're a company like Costco, you've got a ton of stores, so it's pretty easy. Pick a representative sample of a bunch of stores and put them in group ""A."" That's the control. Pick another, similarly representative sample of stores, and introduce the treatment condition (the loss leader). That's group ""B."" Compare the sales from Group A with the sales from Group B and, if you did a good job picking similar stores for each group, you've got your conclusion. 

Companies are generally trying to maximize profits, but that doesn't mean they can't experiment. Otherwise, how would they know if it's a good idea to introduce a new product, raise prices, etc.?"

Is there a conflict of interest between personal finance and the economy?,"I am very tired and happened to come across this moments before heading to bed, but felt obligated to provide some sort of response. So forgive potential incoherency or sloppiness on my part. 

I don't believe this characterization of the economy is remotely accurate in any meaningful way. When individuals do not spend money, they save it. Often that money is saved in a bank or they buy stocks. Banks will take that money, and because they wish to earn a profit, they will often invest it into firms they believe will net them the highest return while trying to minimize risk. Firms receive this money from banks and stock issuances and will allocate those funds into investments they believe will net them the highest return while minimizing risk. 

There's always some sort of tradeoff between consuming more today and trying to invest more to maximize societal welfare, which is what economists really care about when studying 'the economy' rather than something like GDP - which just happens to be one reasonable way to measure this. Market economies seem to be pretty good at striking that balance on their own, and to the extent there is underinvestment in the future relative to immediate consumption, it generally has more to do with potentially great risks involved in successful R&amp;D than an aversion to investing in the future per se.

There are also certain instances like recessions where people do in fact consume at levels below societal welfare maximization as a consequence from panic, excess unemployment, etc, and it makes sense for the government to step in and help close that gap with monetary and fiscal stimulus. However, that does not mean the 'economy' or individuals would be better if in normal times the government continually stepped in and tried to boost consumer spending, even if that would still theoretically increase GDP in the short term.

&gt; A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof

I am not well-read on this matter, but intuitively I do not think it makes much sense or am personally aware of anything empirical to support these claims. Investment is also still a form of spending, albeit one where the payoff is less immediate than consumption. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon."

How come houses keep creeping up in price despite people not being able to afford them?1,"Low interest rates keep the monthly payments low even if the total price is much much higher than it used to be. Notice that rents are virtually disconnected from ownership price.

https://fullstackeconomics.com/the-2000s-housing-bubble-was-greatly-exaggerated/

What would it take? Building units *where* people want to live. This basically means high density. Urbanization (people moving to cities) is not stopping, also assuming you are talking about US prices, we should factor in US population growth too, and housing supply needs to keep up with that too.

Less than 5 years of median income unit prices need the kind of economics that is basically only possible if housing becomes industrialized (ie. mass produced) and the land price is shared between many units."

"If 42 million people get evicted after the eviction moratorium expires, what happens to the housing market?","I agree with /u/HOU_Civil_Econ.

I think it's likely that the government will have some plan. Probably they will resume distributing money to the unemployed. That will allow some of them to restart paying their rent.

In my view it's unlikely that the eviction moratoriums will last for a long time. After all, the landlords still have costs to pay like mortgages and repairs. Many landlords in the US are small-time and only own one or two properties. So, I expect an end to that and some sort of welfare for renters.

Like HOU I'm not convinced that there will be so many extra evictions. Even if there are, a house price crash is not certain. House-buyers and landlords are looking at the long-term.

Something people have to remember is that recessions don't always come with associated house-price crashes. That happened in 2008, but it doesn't happen every time. More often than not house-prices rise or stay fairly level."

Why would an insurance company not renew a policy rather than raise the premium?,"That just means that insurance companies believe that nobody would buy insurance at the price they would charge. 

There is an important distinction between idiosyncratic risk (1% of houses will have kitchen fires while 99% will not) and systemic risk (with 1% probability a natural disaster will burn most houses and with 99% probability it will burn none).

Because of the way probability works (law of large numbers) insurance companies face little risk when insuring idiosyncratic risk. Maybe one year 0.8% or houses will burn and the next year it will be 1.2%, but it will never be 50%. 

In contrast, when it comes down to systemic risk, we are talking about a 1% chance that the insurance company suffers devastating losses on a given year. Therefore, providing insurance from systemic risk is much more expensive."

I have a very broad question (perhaps too broad...) so feel free to spend as much or as little time answering it as you feel.

Although it's not my primary field, I've dipped my toes into health economics occasionally, and I've notice that most people I've talked to seem to fall into one of two camps. The first believes that health behaviors are largely fixed in adulthood and that while cost burdens can be reduced, there isn't very much that can be done to improve actual health outcomes. They cite things like the experiment in Oregon, the fact that health outcomes don't seems to respond much to income or unemployment shocks, etc. The other camp believes that outcomes can be changed and point to some papers finding reductions in mortality after ACA Medicaid expansion.

Do you fall into a camp? Or, more generally, how do you think about this question/debate?"

Are developed countries 'exporting' pollution to poor countries?,"You can't really draw the conclusion you made from that graph. But, the idea that rich/developed countries export their pollution to developing countries is not that controversial. The extent to which it happens is more debatable than whether it happens:

&gt;Despite awareness of the detrimental impact of CO2 pollution on the world climate, countries vary widely in how they design and enforce environmental laws. Using novel micro data about firms' CO2 emissions levels in their home and foreign countries, we document that firms headquartered in countries with strict environmental policies perform their polluting activities abroad in countries with relatively weaker policies. These effects are stronger for firms in high-polluting industries and with poor corporate governance characteristics. Although firms export pollution, they nevertheless emit less overall CO2 globally in response to strict environmental policies at home.

"Ran into these words of advice by Michael J. Burry to fellow investors trying to imitate a Warren Buffett style of investing, thought it was appropriate for the subreddit and a timeless observation so here you go:","Love this take on investing.

I personally believe a lot of the “imitation” is a result of the way investing and analysis is taught. Many go to a college/university with little to no background in the subject. They interpret the textbook as a bible and believe they need to fall into these very specific, rigid lines of thought.

This is compounded by the way students are evaluated. A multiple choice exam leaves you no room for deviation. Right or wrong, black or white, good or bad.

This becomes so hammered into a person’s approach that they often don’t realize they are group thinking. This is something I believe has more of an effect in today’s market than we want to admit.

Personal safety when traveling,"Corporate Security/Intel guy and former director of a HNW-client travel security company. Basically it depends entirely on your destination, personal exposure and risk tolerance. Thinking about your security definitely doesn't mean you are being ""too worried"": you're just conducting an ad hoc risk assessment, and by thinking about these things you are already overcoming the biggest threat to most people's personal security: complacency. Most people don't face these issues so we are somewhat normalised to assume that it isn't needed.

That said, having personal security is quite an invasive and restrictive thing, so it isn't something to jump into lightly unless you really need it. Also worth noting, having a full time CPO team (bodyguards) is really up at the top end, and it may be more appropriate to consider interim measures such as security-trained drivers, remote location monitoring and regular check-ins, and emergency evac insurance. Proactive destination assessments are also always worth considering so that you can tailor your defensive posture for each destination. You might not need a CPO in London, but you might in Sao Paulo.

Now, I can look at the numbers just like him or anyone else.  I can look at the company, its products, its financials, its management, its future plans, etc., and I can decide what I think it's worth.  I think we are at less of a disadvantage to the financial gurus than most of us would realize.  

I also think that investing in individual stocks is valuable, in and of itself, because it forces you to learn more about business, technology, financials, and really just the world as a whole.  The more you learn, the better you become.  You should always try to be learning in life and I think that investing in individual stocks is one good way to do that.

Everyone is going to have their own investing style and I am not criticizing folks who want to have an all index fund portfolio.  There's plenty of evidence that that is a really good approach.  But I think they are missing out on the learning, and potentially on the outsized gains, that can come with researching a stock."
Etoro got their 1.5% of all GME holder straight from the Gamestop There are over 89 Million Diamond handed Apes out there.,"Oh boy.

EDIT 3: Looks like this has been debunked. There are ~96,660 GME holders on eToro. If they are 1.5% of GME shareholders then we're looking at ~6.4 million shareholdes. I'm not sure if that number includes insiders and institutions. A 14 share average would still put us over the total outstanding shares of the company."

"Dad is offering to sell me his house at a significant discount, but the location is not very compatible with my life. Would it be stupid to not take this deal?","What you need is advice on how to have a conversation with your dad.    
Dad, This is an amazing offer. I'm really grateful.  What made you decide to do offer this to me?  Why is that important to you?  What are you trying to achieve?   


Assuming the answer is both ""I want to help you"" and ""I feel sentimental about the house""  I think you can say:   


Right now is not a good time for me to move to LOCATION, and I'm not sure whether that will ever work for me.  I'm really working on building my career/ finding a partner/ whatever you do that he supports.  I don't think I'd be able to do that with an hour long commute each way.   I see a few options.  If you want to keep owning the house, we could spend some weekends working on it together and then you could rent it out and I could manage it. That way you could keep it for sentimental reasons, and it could be some additional income for me. 

You could sell it as is, or fix it up and sell, and then give me the profit for a purchase of a condo/ house closer to where I am now.  While we'd have to fill out tax forms, there wouldn't be taxes on that gift. That way I could start building equity where I live now. 

If you'd just prefer to be done with it, I could buy it, but my plan would be to fix it up and sell.  I don't want to do that if that would make you feel bad.    


I really do appreciate your generosity.  I love you so much and have so many great memories of that house.  I wish the world was different, but for now it just isnt' the right decision for me."

"Marrying into a 10 digit family, prenup advice","As others have said, everything going in should be clearly scheduled/listed as separate property.

Since your main concern is that your earnings during the marriage are substantially higher, there are two ways to do it that I think are fair and have seen:

1. As someone else suggested, figure out an annual amount that you will be paid for each year of marriage.  It does not need to be fixed (i.e. 100K/year).  There could be waterfalls, or after X years it could stop (i.e. 100K/year for first 5 years, 200K/year for 6-15 years, nothing more past 15 years).
2. If it is distasteful to either of you to get paid for your ""years of service"" then another way to write it up is that he needs to contribute from his trust (or other sources of) income to the community property an amount equal to your annual income (can be done annually, or quarterly in arrears if your income isn't stable/known at beginning of each period).  This way, when your community property gets split up at time of divorce, you've each contributed equally to that pot."

One consideration. You might want to not share that you are considering bankruptcy with your lawyers just yet, and I would get on the other end of the divorce before you do. Make sure you don't declare bankruptcy and then get hit with new debts just as you're starting over. You'll find the quality of the legal counsel you're enlisting will drop dramatically -- or altogether -- the second the firm finds out it might not be getting paid. Might be unethical depending on who you ask, but (like hospitals) lawyers tend to inflate their costs to account for non-payment."

Can someone explain why SE Asia is soooo goddamn cheap?,"There are several parts to this.  Firstly, there is the Balassa-Samuelson effect.  Then there are other more specific aspects of costs.

It is useful to start with a thought experiment about two countries, X and Y.  This is purely a thought experiment, not a description of how economic development occurred.  Initially, there are trade barriers and there is no trade between X and Y.

People in country X develop technology and apply it to the production of some goods.  That increases the productivity of people in country X.  This increases incomes in country X.  That's because the goods produced by these new industries will fall in price.  (This price fall may be masked by inflation caused by money creation).  However, not all goods will fall in price.  Some goods are being produced by old processes that have not been affected by technology.

Over in country Y not much has changed, everything is fairly low-tech and low-productivity.  Now what happens when the two countries start to trade with each other?  Usually, the currency of X is worth more than the currency of Y.  After all, X is producing more.

The impact of this on local goods is interesting.  Some goods trade between the two countries and have the same price.  However, lots of goods and especially services are local and can't be traded between countries.  For those goods prices are high in X and lower in Y.  

Some people look at that as the effect of the currency exchange rate.  In a sense it is.  The deeper reason for the difference is that wages must be competitive.  Those who are working in low-productivity industries in country X could leave and go to the high-productivity industries.  As a result, the low-productivity industries must pay competitive rates.  That makes the output of these low productivity industries relatively expensive.  As /u/ChillyPhilly27 says this effect within one country is Baumol's cost disease.

So, that's the Balassa-Samuelson effect.  Those two people were the last Economists to discover this.  It was discovered many times in the past and forgotten.  Samuelson, who was famous within Economics, managed to make it famous.

Now, it's worth saying a few things about the examples given that seem to contradict this.

&gt; My soda cost 20 baht- the can was made of aluminum they don’t have, they don’t have petroleum to produce the plastic in my water bottle that cost 10 baht.

In bulk soda and bottled water are very cheap in the developed world too.  My local supermarket in Ireland is selling 24 cans of Coca Cola for 15.95 euros.  That's about 70 US cents per can.  The wholesale price is undoubtedly cheaper.

When you buy soft drinks in a convenience store you are paying for the staff and the rent.  Those things are expensive in the developed world.

&gt; Bangkok is a major urban center with huge skyscrapers made from steel and concrete, yet I can stay in fancy digs for like $25 US...

Lots of the cost of construction is labour.  That is also important for hotels.  Hotels need cleaning and lots of staff doing other things.  That's expensive in the developed world.

For both examples here you also have to remember the cost of zoning and planning permissions in the developed world.  That makes building land and rents more expensive.

&gt; Like how the fuck can everybody afford a modern cellphone, computers etc- when top 10% earners are only pulling in like 17-20k US per annum…

The price of those things doesn't vary much between country.  People buy them because they are very useful.  They also have recreational uses that people enjoy a lot.  That said basic smartphones are not that expensive these days.

When you buy a smartphone contract in the US you are also paying for the network to provide coverage across that huge country.

&gt; how can I take a flight for 30 dollars across a country? Jet fuel doesn’t come at a discount, nor do 747s, ya know?

The price is fairly similar in Europe.  I just looked up a flight with Ryanair from an airport near my home in Ireland to the UK.  It was €8 one way without baggage.  With baggage it's €33.  That's not an offer, I take the route often and it's usually that cheap.

I could also fly to Budapest in Hungary, a distance of about 1300 miles.  That's €31 euro and about €56 with baggage.  The round trip is €116 that's ~$122 for a trip that is more than 3 times the distance of the one you mentioned."

EDIT:  Added in several suggestions and clarified other bits.  Definitely need to make sure this is comprehensive.

EDIT:  Okay since the thread is locked, but still very popular, I'll add some discussion into real estate.  Note that this is my experience as someone who has invested in California, USA.  I originally put High risk, but have downgraded it to Medium-high risk.  When I put ""high"", I was considering a lot of things that involve work, but if you're willing to put the work in to stay on top of things, then the risk is mitigated.  Also, when I first started in real estate, I heard many horror stories from family friends (lawsuits, massive las vegas market crash 800k property -&gt; 200k, tenants wrecking home, etc).  There are also insurances out there for natural disasters, but it's still a risk, depending on location.  Also the headache from evictions and potential conflict from kicking someone out of their home is far greater than anything you'd see in stocks.  You are dealing with humans here and that means skills that would otherwise not be needed in personal investing.  The chances of these bad things happening are low, certainly in the single digits, but they exist.

On a macro scale, generally it is quite stable, however, just like how stock markets can have big downswings, so can real estate markets.  Granted, it is very rare for a real estate market not to recover, and you can usually depend on the value continuing to go up.

And some have asked how a person with $30k USD can get into real estate.  Back in 2012, I put $25k down on a $125k condominium, had another 6-7k in closing costs, and took a 15 year mortgage out on the rest.  The rent paid was able to cover the mortgage (and then some), and since then, the value of the property has doubled to $250k.  Most major metropolitan markets are certainly past the $125k range now, but it just depends on where you live.

EDIT: The interest rates I've stated are for the US and the current rates.  The rates can change.  All rates are what you can generally expect in the market right now.  If you find higher yield bank accounts, CHECK THE FEES."

"Maths and gambling: You could be gambling with your future not because you want to, but because you haven't thought the maths through","If someone requires more intuition of exact maths behind these expected returns here it is. Suppose the investment returns were such that 60% of time you get 1.5X and 40% of time you get 0.6X. So how do we calculate expected return? Imagine you invest with this strategy for consecutively for 100 rounds. That is, you start with a certain sum, invest it and then invest the output from the investment again and so on for a 100 times. By rules of game you would expect that about 60% of time you will get 1.5X and remaining 40% of time 0.5X, right. So what is the expected final sum of money you will be left with? Convince yourself that after a 100 rounds It would be = initial * [(1.5)^(60) * (0.5)^(40)]. Now its all simple. Suppose expected return is alpha. Then you expect the final sum to be = initial * (alpha)^100. Here final sum is computed assuming in each round you got return of alpha (by definition of expectations). So we just equate both the value of final sums to obtain alpha = (1.5)^(0.6)*(0.6)^(0.4). This is actually weighted geometric mean."
Has this aspect of wealth been studied?,"Can you first articulate your theory about why ""the City"" would make this choice in the first place? I am having a hard time understanding the logic about why the 20 would be so much easier. I'm assuming you are talking about the US; otherwise, the law will be different.

Point 1: You mention ""going after the property"" of the 20 poor families-- but if they are that poor, they don't own the property, they rent it. So, they are going against the **landlords** of 20 properties, versus the owners/possible occupants of 3. Dealing with 20 landlords seems at least as difficult as dealing with 3 ""rich people"".

Point 2: Winning an eminent domain case against the government is a 1 in 1,000 shot in the dark, and expensive at that. Very few people with sense would fight it-- instead you want to hire a lawyer to negotiate the best settlement possible, not to fight it. These rich people with good lawyers will get good advice, and start shopping for or designing their new house right away.

&gt;The mere threat of what a rich person can do can be enough for them to avoid a confrontation.

Point 3: What can the rich person do? Unless they are Bill Gates, the city has more resources; sadly, they also have the law on their side, given the ever-expanding scope allowed for government takings in recent years. I don't agree with how it has expanded to include ""building warehouses just because some business needs them"", but well over 99% of the time you will lose.

Point 4: Eminent domain doesn't take the property for free, the city still must pay fair market value-- sometimes even more than that (according to the ""highest and best use"" of the property) plus moving expenses. These 20 houses on average would need to be worth 1/7th the amount of the others.

Point 5: Why the rush? In my experience, the eminent domain part comes a good 5 years before any project is planned to really get started-- these road projects are planned out WAY in advance. That is plenty of time for the government to win any lawsuits that anyone is foolish enough to file.

I agree with you in general that there are plenty of ways that people with more money have it easier than people with less (e.g., the kinds of things from *Nickled and Dimed*, and much more; I just don't see how it makes a lot of sense in this specific scenario."
Best Canadian dividend stocks to hold forever,"Buy divided paying companies that have low dividend payout ratios (EPS and / or FFO), decent growth rates and yield.  Too high of dividend yield may indicate a dividend cut is imminent and too low may indicate it's over valued.

If you want a less risky portfolio, choose companies or sectors that have a competitive advantage like:

Utilities, telcos - regulated by public utilities commissions. Remember a utility is a monopoly. Who doesn't like a dividend paying monopoly that is protected from competiton by regulators and can recover most losses (PG&amp;E is an example of how a utility should not be run).  

Big 6 banks- regulated, can't merge together, oligopoly, and you can bet if a Canadian bank collapses, the feds will bail them out because of the systematic risk they pose to the economy

Rails - regulated, can't merge , oligopoly 

Inflation advantage - one of the things I like about the banks is they benefit from inflation (stable, not hyperinflation).  When things cost more, people borrow more, when people borrow more, banks earn more interest income which translates into higher bank earnings and dividends. Ask yourself, which companies have such a natural advantage without risk of losing a large number  customers or risk seeing a large demand reduction.  

Contracted, take or pay - companies that have a stable cash flow stream because they have  contracted operations with quality counterparties.  Typically midstream, IPPs, REITs.  Be mindful though of the underlying risk of their counterparties as you are taking their business risk exposure.  

Franchise advantage: companies that have some sort of or combination of franchise, regulatory, competitive advantage that is very hard to disrupt or replicate.  I would classify the LIfecos/ big pipelines in this bucket.  

Risk: dividend investing has risks.  Understand and get comfortable with your level of risk.  Once you do that, then you do the next form of pyramid dividend investing (no I am not talking of a multi-level scam or ponzi scheme)

EDIT: why dont't I buy ETFs?  Dividend ETFs are great if you're a hands off investor, don't have the time to do the research or manage your portfolio, don't trust yourself to make the right decision so you want professionals to do it, or find it just easier.  If you fit into any of those categories, stop reading because you won't like my answer next.

I manage my own portfolio because none of the above reasons apply to me.  Dividend investing is my side hustle.   I also don't want to pay a MER for something I can do myself.  A friend asked why I don't buy the Canadian bank ETF for ease?  For the simple reason I can buy all 6 major banks and avoid the MER.   Also I like the flexibility of getting the cash from the dividends to invest in other growth stocks or for personal use

"Averaging down, buying more of an asset biggest wealth destroyer: Zerodha CEO","Agree with it completely. For a good stock investor, it might be an opportunity. But most of the investors are not good stock pickers. 

I started working in 2002 and started investing in 2003. In 2012 my grand wealth was 50Lakhs (around15L of which are gifts) and 25L are in a savings account, not even FD. The xirr of my direct stock investments is negative (due averaging down 3iinfotech heavily from 120 levels to 10-20 levels) and overall xirr is 3-4%. I finally sold 3iinfotech at 4, booking an almost 80% loss. If you get these returns in the golden period of investing in India, you have to change the way you deal with stuff.

In 2012 I sat down. Updated excel with all the things I did in the last 9 years, calculated xirrs etc. Saw that my derivative trading was a zero-sum game with all the brokerage as loss, direct equity is a loss due to fence-sitting with all the money in the bank waiting to be deployed and averaging down. The mutual funds are what brought the xirr to +ve range and overall returns are less than savings interest.

I closed the Demat account. Moved all my money to 30% equity funds and 70% debt funds and started sips (I do manual sips but disciplined enough to not miss any instalment in the last 9 years) in equity. Currently, my equity and debt funds are in the 64:36 ratio. I never redeemed a single rupee except for fund switches and always saw that 95% of my money is invested. And it worked well. Direct equity is not for everybody and averaging down at least for me was a wealth destroyer."

How is it possible for a single company's bankruptcy to bring down the whole economy?,"Usually the companies in question are major financial entities that lend money to other companies and hold others' investments. So if they collapse it triggers losses, and often a lack of access to cash, in other companies as well. Called a ""liquidity crisis"" because companies will lack cash flow to pay immediate Bill's due to the shock, and be forced to sell assets... which triggers economic contraction and expands the problem. 

However - In 2008, Lehman and Bear Stearns were the first to collapse, but they weren't the only ones. They were a symptom of a broader collapse in the US subprime mortgage market that caused a liquidity crunch in a large number of financial institutions - which  all sold the mortgages, insured them through another branch of the same company, and repackaged the mortgages into securities that they sold on the open market. (Plus, it was real estate values collapsing, which cut into consumer credit access because of home equity loans, triggered foreclosures, plummeted demand for new construction, etc.)

Evergrande - and even Lehman - weren't big enough to do that on their own. But often when one collapses, investors start panicking and looking around at other, similar companies- driving up borrowing costs, etc. or suddenly responding en masse to a problem that was bubbling under the surface for a long time.

To understand financial crises more, and 2008 in particular, I'd recommend looking into Robert Shiller's work on herd mentality/irrationality in investment, and maybe at some of Nouriel Roubini's work on how financial crises operate. You might also look at something like Paul Blustein's ""The Chastening"" for a more approachable journalistic treatment of the 1997-8 asian crisis that shared important similarities with 2008."

&gt;You will be rewarded if you are able to consistently solve the problems your bosses and clients want you to solve. This does not mean you should not advocate for yourself (quite the opposite actually); it simply means you must create value to capture value.

This is something people really don't get at all.

You can always ask for a raise, but unless you're doing something noticeable and creating value the answer will always be 'no'. My approach was always to ask for *additional responsibilities*, particularly when they were things I wanted to learn to progress my career anyway, and once I was good at them I'd ask for more money - which I'd always get.

I haven't worked for anyone since my mid 20s, but that approach got me up the corporate ladder in a flash. Toward the end when all of my 'peers' were 15+ years older than me none of them could understand how I got there so they assumed it was nepotism of some kind. Most people think that success is something that *happens to you* rather than something *you make happen* and they will create whatever narrative they need to to keep that mindset.

"I am Dave Lauer, CEO of Urvin Finance, was recently a guest on The Problem with Jon Stewart on Apple TV+, and I’m here to talk with you about the stock market and retail advocacy. AMA!","There is a man, Dr. Jim Decosta, who spent 24 years of his life devoted to exposing corruption in our financial system. No one really knows what has happened to him, but in honor of him I want to know if you are aware of his findings. He has made countless comments to the SEC like [this](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm), which have unsurprisingly resulted in nothing.

One of the biggest revelations from his work is the notion that major institutions such as Fidelity or Vanguard loan out shares that are held in retirement accounts for their own benefit and the detriment of those holders' positions. There is little risk to them to do this, since these positions are typically held for decades per the nature of these accounts. This is explicitly illegal, yet there is (as close as we will get as bystanders) almost proof that this occurs.

With the disappearance of most pensions, the massive tax benefits these accounts provide for hopeful retirees, company matching programs, and the fact that you have to use the firm that your workplace selects, workers are practically forced into using these accounts to save for retirement. Thus they are forced to purchase shares which are then illegally lent out without their permission, potentially hurting the value of their own investments, while not sharing any of the interest from said lending.

I want to ask you what you think about this scheme and if you would be interested in helping to track down Dr. Jim Decosta for further discussion."
Should your kids really inherit millions if you die suddenly?,"Finally, one I can help with!

I'm the son of a HNW individual (you can check my post history for additional context if you want).

Where I am now: 35. NW of \~$4.2m, liquid NW of about $2.2m (I live in a very VHCOL place - a $2m house is a ""normal"", rather than extravagant, house here). I'm excellent with personal finance and investing, have a good work ethic, live a middle class lifestyle, am not particularly materialistic.

Keys to how I got here:

\-Parents started gifting money early - maximum tax-free gift amount each year from both parents. They invested and managed it until I was \~22 or so (at that point it had grown to about $400k). I didn't make any big changes to their investment strategy until I was \~26 or so and had learned a lot about investing; my sister stuck with them managing things longer until she learned the basics and now keeps a 3 fund portfolio. 

\-My parents always told me that this money was for my first house and maybe a bit extra as a cushion but that it wasn't meant to be used without need. As a result I went through some very difficult times -- including living in a city where I had no social network, no income (it was the recession and I couldn't get a job) and was in love with someone with chronic medical issues she couldn't pay for -- and even so, I didn't touch this money that had been gifted at a young age - in fact I may have gone too far by not touching the money here, as I ended up in a stressful and physically dangerous job just to make ends meet. They *really* hammered home that the money was a one-shot thing and I wouldn't get more until *maybe* after they died - and definitely not if I spent any of that money on frivolous stuff. My sister was equally responsible with her money. 

\-Parents started teaching us about finances when we were about 10. It was a bit weird being the only 5th grader with a debit card but it was an effective way to show personal finance in action.

\-Parents talked openly about finances but didn't get into figures until I was about 18. I don't know how much this impacted my attitude but it did keep me from ""counting their money"" as if I had any right or say over it.

\-Parents ultimately decided - when my sister and I grew up enough for them to determine we weren't screw-ups, lazy, entitled, etc. to gift us some additional assets since they had so much and they didn't love the idea of so much going to the government in the event of their untimely death. At the same time they set up an estate plan which included their entire NW going to their *grandchildren* when they died (generation-skipping trust).

To address some of your questions directly:

\&gt; I wonder if $10MM falling out of the sky and landing on someone's head is a good thing.

It's not. I grew up in a town known for it's wealth and saw this happen a couple of times. It always went badly (either the money disappeared, the adult-child's life took crazy (negative) turns due to sudden access to wealth and in one case, a complete mental breakdown (his father had successfully hid that he was a billionaire until we were in high school).

\&gt; if she grows up with two dead parents, do I feel confident she will end up with those values?

Nope. These values need to be taught and reinforced. Your best bet in this situation is for the money to go to a trust and the trustee to be whomever you would ""give"" your kids to in the event of your death. Ideally, that person/people shares your values (in my case, my kid(s) will go to my sister if my wife and I both pass, as we don't know how my wife's family would handle the money, values around money and especially the financial education - my FIL swears by his ""guy"" at Edward Jones who manages all his money...).

\&gt; On the other hand, if she turns 35, finds out her old man was once worth $10MM way back in 2020 but she only got like 500k of it (even though all her schooling, activities, personal development etc were taken care of), does that screw her up too?

I can only speak to this second hand but in the instances I saw this, it depends - if the 35 year old is a well-rounded, fulfilled person it's not an issue; if they've been really struggling in life it may breed resentment, confusion, etc.

\&gt; What are you guys doing, leaving a reasonable amount, or leaving the whole fat stash behind?

I can't stress enough how useful I believe the middle path of giving them a reasonable amount *over time and while you're still alive* has been for my family. My sister and I are unlike in so many ways -- but we both tend to think of ourselves as middle-class, normal people who just happen to have a couple million lying around in case we want to change careers to something less lucrative or start a business or RE early or just sleep soundly knowing if we have some serious bad turn in our lives that there's a financial cushion there. And I believe this mentality stemmed from the fact that we had responsibility for this money, were tasked with maintaining (ideally growing) it and by extension got hands-on experience with compounding growth, time value of money, etc. before we were out of college.

As for the amount - I forget who said it but the way I think of the money we got was that it was ""enough to do anything but not enough to do nothing"". Now that I'm older and it's growth quite a bit from aggressive investing and good personal finance practices, I *can* ""do nothing"" but that's not very appealing; again, my sister is the same.

As for my own kids...they're getting set up the same way I was. Maximum gift each year by both grandparents, which I manage in a trust that she gets full access to when she's 35. When my parents die, the huge lump sum will likewise go into the trust. I intend for the ""35"" figure to be an unnecessary restriction and will start involving them in the management (and removal of funds, should they have good places to spend it) of the trust when they're in their early/mid 20's or have demonstrated themselves to be financially responsible, whichever comes sooner. My wife knows all of this and I trust her to do the same as I would if I pass early. If we both go, I trust my sister to do the same.

Hope that helps and feel free to ask any questions."
ELI5 why the national debt does not matter.,"Here's an undergrad economics level explanation. Likely some of the better educated folks in the sub will provide a more nuanced and complete answer. 

Confidence the US has the ability to pay back loans matters. Best evidence is investors care about debt to GDP ratios, not nominal debt. If this is the case, any borrowing that has a rate of return above one, will reduce this ratio. If you can borrow a dollar, and it produces more than a dollar's worth of GDP, you've reduced the debt to GDP ratio.  

Opportunity cost matters as well. Right now, there are very few low risk investment opportunities. This is true to such an extent that people are willing to accept a negative interest rate for the safety of US treasuries. It's literally free to borrow right now.  As an aside, hopefully all redeemable treasuries are now being paid off with new borrowing. 

As far as I know, economists do not agree on any particular debt to GDP ratio as an upper limit.  That's not to say there isn't one, but that it's fact and circumstance dependent, and we don't know what it is for sure. 

* CBO on debt: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56309

* Reinhardt and Rogan trying to quantify upper limits of debt to GDP ratios: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/24376/1/MPRA_paper_24376.pdf

Just two other things. First, Peter Schiff has been saying the same thing for almost two decades now, and he has never been correct.  He's not an economist and he's not a first-rate investor. second, there is no threat of inflation looming on the horizon that we can measure in any way at this point. Perhaps there will be a time when inflation takes off, and the monetary supply will need to be restricted. That's different than debt.

Economists do agree debt can get out of control and cause problems: http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/high-debt-countries/ 
Economist generally do not agree that the core tenets of MMT hold all the time and everywhere: http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory/"

Buying a Yacht $1 million - Any Advice,"This might sound counterintuitive but here it goes…

"If Santa Claus was real, would he cause any significant inflation?","Lol no, toy’s prices would simply be lower. An increase in the creation of toys is not an increase in the quantity of money. The increase in the supply of toys with the stable demand would simply decrease equilibrium price. So it would be deflationary for that industry (and even for the whole economy). Take MV=PQ, assuming no change in M and V (because Santa does not control the money supply nor the velocity), an increase in Q (output) would result in a decrease in P (the average price level)."
"Why aren't individual taxed only on ""profits"" like corporations are?","The simple answer is that it doesn't really matter.

Let's consider a simplified world where profits, wage income, and equipment/input sales are taxed at a constant rate. Call the rates `tau_p`, `tau_w`, and `tau_e` respectively.

A company generates `Y` revenue, pays `W` in wages to workers, `E` in costs for equipment.

How much tax is paid? Well `tau_w*W` gets paid on the wages, `tau_e*E` gets paid on the equipment, and `tau_p*(Y-W-E)` gets paid on profits so total taxes paid are `tau_p*Y + (tau_w-tau_p)*W + (tau_e-tau_p)*E`

Now suppose we replace the profit tax with a revenue tax `tau_y` (i.e. we don't let corps deduct their costs). Let's also update `tau_w` and `tau_e` to `tau_w2` and `tau_e2` will we are updating the tax code. Now taxes paid on revenue are `tau_y*Y` and total taxes are `tau_y*Y + tau_w2*W + tau_e2*E`.

So we can see that if `tau_y=tau_p`, `tau_w2=(tau_w-tau_p)`, and `tau_e2=(tau_e-tau_p)`, the tax structures are equivalent! It doesn't matter whether we tax profits or revenues, as long as we make sure to adjust the tax on operating costs.

In reality, we choose to tax profits because taxing revenue would lead to ""double taxation"" of wages (any dollar you received as a wage would first have been taxed when the company paying you earned it as revenue, and then would be taxed again when you receive it as income) which is something people generally try to avoid/dislike, although, economically, it doesn't really matter (due to the same logic demonstrated above)."

GME short sellers have lost $443.4 million so far this month. GME among the top 10 most unprofitable stocks for short sellers during July 2022,"Still long.

If we're right, I'm finally early to something in the market. If we're wrong, I lose what, maybe 50% of what I have invested? Big deal, move onto the next investment. Even if it bankrupted, there's little difference between what I've invested and what someone loses via options. Those who DRS aren't selling, so when 100% of the float is DRS'd either nothing happens and retail realizes they were wrong and begin selling, or we see if wall street is hiding things.

One thing's for certain, there's enough 'glitches' around the stock that sparks interest (IE short interest glitches, price glitches in brokers, etc). Why are broker apps only notifying people on the days GME goes down, and not up while still notifying you of positive days in other stocks? It shoots up and down 30% on any given day at least once a month it'd seem on no corporate news whatsoever.

Wall street came out and said they closed all their shorts in GME post 1/27/21, 'the sneeze' was the squeeze and the squeeze was over. Are we supposed to believe that they closed their short positions in over 30+ stocks that shot up the exact same time? I mean a huge volume of tickers in unrelated markets exploded on that date. NNDM, BYND, etc.

Last point of note, I really hate that they (media, hedge funds, and even the SEC) call them 'meme' stocks. They're companies that employ real people paying real bills. They're official stock market participants and contribute to federal taxes. Calling them 'meme' stocks as if they're joke companies is shameful."

"John Bogle, who founded Vanguard and revolutionized retirement savings, dies at 89.","““Jack could have been a multibillionaire on a par with Gates and Buffett,” said William Bernstein, an Oregon investment manager and author of several books on finance and economic history.

"Maths and gambling: You could be gambling with your future not because you want to, but because you haven't thought the maths through","Everything about this post is wrong.

There is no need to bet full amount on each bet. This is where **Kelly Criterion** comes into play. If you have +EV bet like in this case, then there exists an optimal ratio of capital for each bet you need to take.

Per Kelly formula, that ratio is 10%. (Run the formula with these numbers. 50% win rate with lose 40% on  a bet, and win 50% on the next bet)

Meaning, if you only bet 10% of your capital on each bet you will make money in the long run over a number of bets for a given capital.

* Bet 1 = Loss. Net loss = 10%*(0.4) =4% lost. Cap remaining = 96%

* Bet 2 = Win. Net win = 9.6%*0.5 = 4.8%. Capital now = 100.8%.

Repeat the whole sequence with 50% win rate like you claim and you will make money.

**Edit: I got the math wrong. Kelly number here is 25%. Not 10%. The discussion remains the same though**"

I look away, twirling the tap anxiously in my fingers. It made sense at the time. It was a bubble, there was no way that it wasn't! Softly, almost imperceptibly, I murmur to myself, ""Less than it should have been...""

"Name the Most/Least Ethical Companies, and Why","BP started as a company called the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that ended up using the US military and the CIA to overthrow the democratically elected Shah, a man named Mohammed Mossedegh (IIRC) and installed a pro-western puppet government. That puppet government was overthrown and then this radical theocracy was installed in what we know as the Iranian Revolution of the late 70’s, and has been a sworn enemy of the west ever since. BP isn’t solely responsible for the chaos in the Middle East, but they played a big part in perpetuating it through a big part of the 20th century.

Have we Forgotten what Defines Value Investing?,"In the current market the big stocks like AAPL or AMZN are more a value investment than a huge amount of the rest. Their future earnings are not really speculative and there is a reason for their current price.  A lot of technology/EV/Green Energy companies have way more extreme valuations while all competing for the same space. 

Of course you can argue that they are not true value investments, but the true value investments are contrarian in nature. The more people are in the same place, the less contrarian they think - so that a subreddits upvoted analysis for stocks that have done tremendous over the last few years is not only logical but actually expected. 

Writeups on smaller companies are much harder to do since there is less information and will get you a lot less attention.

Why do people still invest with hedge funds?,"Hedge funds firstly are unavailable to common investors like you or I, the big dogs take clients with massive net worths. The whole point of a “hedge” fund is to provide uncorrelated returns to the broader market. Not necessarily to beat the markets return itself. You might ask, why anyone would want to take the lower returns? It’s because some of these super high net worth individuals care more about having a hedge against huge market downturns and black swan events. Essentially it’s a another tool in the tool box to help diversify their portfolio. If a HF manager can provide me 6% returns on average, even though that’s lower than the average of the index they will be uncorrelated so it provides me a safety net. Some of it has to do with client interaction and the associated prestige but most of the inflow into HF is, well for, hedging."
My roommate's bf is staying. Can I ask him to pay 1/3 of the gas &amp; electrics?,OP just explain to your roommate that you have been kind enough to allow her bf to stay for two months without him contributing to the expenses. Tell her that if he stays past August 31 then you will contribute 1/3 of rent and utilities until he moves out. Your roommate and her bf are taking advantage of your kindness and it is now time for you to advocate for yourself.

Please think forever before putting your hard-earned money in FI money savings account,"India doesn't have an arena for an Ally or SoFi yet. Until the RBI comes with a legislation permitting Neobanks to operate, steer clear of these pretenders latching on to the legacy system of a proper bank at the backend (in this case, Federal Bank).

What are the worst ways of measuring national poverty you see people use frequently?,"The federal poverty level (aka the census bureau’s official poverty measure) is a very outmoded threshold. It is measured as 3-times a “minimum food budget”and is adjusted for inflation and family size, but otherwise hasn’t changed since 1963. This is the most widely reported poverty measure in the US and is used as a means threshold for eligibility for all sorts of social programs. Kinda bonkers to think the preeminent poverty measure in contemporary America doesn’t include geographic cost of living adjustment (the supplemental poverty measure does) nor the additional expenses households generally incur like cell phone and Internet bills, insurance, higher education debt, etc."

starting to lose faith in capitalism...help me out here,"Economists don't tend to use the term 'capitalism' as it is too unclear: countries from Denmark to the Republic of Congo get called 'capitalist'. 

Economists also tend to assume that everyone acts in their own self-interest and at the expense of others, including voters, government officials and people working for non-profits. For example, zoning laws keeping house prices high benefit middle and upper class home owners at the expense of the poor and renters. On the issue of pensions, most countries are facing an incoming [pensions crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_crisis#:~:text=The%20pensions%20crisis%20or%20pensions,set%20aside%20to%20fund%20them.) due to government underfunding of pension promises: an event that will presumably result in a combination of cuts to promised pensions and tomorrow's workers facing higher taxes with no increase in benefits. 

For what it is worth, people are generally eager to immigrate to countries like the USA, Europe and the OECD countries, many people are even willing to risk their lives to do so illegally, so it seems that overall whatever those countries are doing is less bad even for the most marginal workers than what they expect in their own home countries."
Why doesnt the fed give money straight to the people instead of adjusting interest rates to keep inflation in check?,"If the fed made direct payments to public, it would be creating liabilities (new base money) without increasing its assets. This is bad because if inflation were to rise, the central bank  may not have sufficient amount of assets to sell (sales destroy base money) to control inflation. So “helicopter money” (what some economists call direct payments by the fed to the public) may lead to an inability to control inflation. The fed also provides the role of a “lender of last resort” meaning it lends to banks that are insolvent (don’t have enough reserves to meet depositors demands for withdrawal). If it gave up that role, banks would have a higher probability of failing."

How do rich people “hoard wealth?”,"&gt;Isn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?

Yes. Billionaires aren't dragons. They don't sit on piles of cash. The wealth they have is largely invested. And at the very least compared to a world where this wealth wouldn't exist, this invested capital ultimately contributes to productivity growth and higher wages. The savings rate in countries like the US is lower than optimal anyway on aggregate, billionaires spending their money instead of investing it certainly wouldn't make this situation better.

""Rich people hoarding wealth"" is a political talking point, nothing more. You could certainly talk about ways to improve aggregate welfare through redistribution, like all kinds of progressive taxation schemes, marginal utility of money and all that, but the reason that makes sense is not because rich people just hoard wealth that does nothing for anyone else.

INTC vs TSM,"TSMC is in Taiwan, not China. China would like  to bring Taiwan back into its control, but it can never actually do anything about it. Any military adventure would be a massive disaster.

1. See Okinawa for how horrifically bloody amphibious operations are, then multiply by at least 10x for the 12x larger Taiwan with 50 times the population.
2. Adjust for the fact the Japanese defenders had zero resupply, and allies totally dominated air and sea with 30 carriers alone for the operation. By contrast three of the top ten militaries will offer direct support to Taiwan (#1 US, #5 Japan, and South Korea), resupply cannot be stopped, and Taiwan has a first world Air-force and thousands of anti-ship and anti-air missiles. Its also the 7th largest military by active soldiers.
3. Even if successful, China would never capture any TSMC tech intact and all the key engineers would escape off island. It can only gain a smoking ruin that would require dealing with a long insurgency.
4. Any conflict closes the south china sea and in combination with sanctions cuts China off from free trade leading to a Chinese depression and possibility of mass unrest that would threaten the hold of the CCP.
5. Lastly, TSMC and other Taiwanese semiconductor makers are building plants in the US and other countries.

TSMC has a massive moat Intel is unlikely to ever be able to breach.

1. TSMC has the lead in most advanced volume processes, it 's starting volume 3 nm production this year. It has a two process size lead on Intel, or about five years.
2. TSMC is not a competitor to its customers, a big reason it got Apples business was that Apple didn't trust Samsung and moved all its production to TSMC as soon as it proved worthy. Those massive volumes enabled TSMC to build the highest manufacturing efficiencies in the industry.
3. So if Intel can catch up in process size, somehow they have to convince their direct competitors such as AMD, nVidia, Apple, Samsung, etc to buy capacity. The only way to do that is to offer massive discounts over what TSMC charges, if pricing is similar everyone will happily say FU Intel.

Lastly there is a massive amount of investment in semiconductor fabs due to the COVID triggered supply chain issues and stimulus driven demand surge from last year. This has led to widespread shortages, so Intel, TSMC, and others are pouring hundreds of billions into new plants.

The problem with this is that semiconductors are extremely cyclical due to massively long lead times. Investment today doesn't lead to new plants for two to three years minimum, so many things can change before they even know if the investment was worthwhile. Typically what happens is overinvestment until a glut happens, and then underinvesment again until shortages re-appear.

Currently it looks like a glut within the next 2-3 years appears likely.

1. Investment is based on demand that was unusually large due to stimulus last year. Some of that probably led to double ordering to try to work around long lead times.
2. PC sales have been in decline for a decade but spiked last year. Now they are declining again.
3. Server demand also spiked the last two years at an unsustainable rate. As lockdowns end its likely demand returns to historic growth patterns, or even has a few years of slow growth to rebalance to normal demand levels.
4. We are likely entering a recession that will further diminish demand across the board.

TSMC should be able to navigate the cycles better than anyone else because of its higher production volumes and efficiencies, and because it's a neutral partner of choice while Samsung and Intel are viewed as untrustworthy competitors."
Will Proof of Stake turn ETH into the best Store of Value coin?,"The way I look at it, once we switch to proof of stake, hodling ether becomes equivalent to owning shares in a dividend producing company.  Ether will not be a store of value, it will be a creator of value.  It will be  providing the service of a well secured public ethereum blockchain, in exchange for cash flow. "
At what point does your money start to make serious gains on its own?,"Just a personal example: I have a brokerage account with $100,000 worth of monthly pay dividend ETFs. I set everything to auto reinvest in 2017 and didn't contribute any further. I checked today and it's sitting at $163,000. Didn't do any buying or selling, the money did it's own work. At the time, it was bringing in about $450 per month in dividends and now it generates $800 per month in dividends as it keeps adding more shares.

So I'm in agreement with $100,000 being a ""magic number"" when it comes to compounding."

That is quite a bit of money to have tied up in obvious red tape. LBC always seemed to have quality support, but three years is a bit much. I’ve met both brothers with my co-founder and they are really reasonable people. ( full disclosure: I am a Co-Founder of Paxful, also a p2p finance service which many see as a competitor to LBC )

P2P marketplaces are a step ahead of centralized exchanges with automated order books but there are still huge problems with fraud and scammers. We @paxful work tirelessly on this and being in the worlds most challenging markets, Nigeria etc.. only makes the challenge greater (but also means our fraud defense is super tight). We ban hundreds of scammers a day and in those cases, we do hold suspend funds in escrow, but only for those who are proven to have scammed others and then these coins are later distributed to scam victims. I’m not trying to make light of your situation as you are CLEARLY LEGIT nor am I defending LBC or even Paxful, just letting you know things are rough out there in p2p land.

Let me state clearly that THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON PAXFUL! We have 24/7 support and even a complicated case like this wouldn’t ever take more than a day or two, especially with the proof you have provided. At the very least we can liaise with the bank in question and inform them you were receiving payment for good and services rendered on our platform.

One of our employees has had over 1 BTC held by LBC for over three years as well and they refuse to release it even after he KYC’ed and there was clearly no fraud as he was selling bitcoins. I don’t know their reasons.

Not sure how I can help here but I am willing to listen to feedback. Without vendors, there is no P2P and the reason we exist is that we listen to you guys. We just wish we did a better job of protecting you all.

Please be patient and offer feedback :slightly\_smiling\_face: We love that!

Even if you just REMIT money to Venezuela if you do it with bitcoin you can make 20% not lose 10% like with Western Union, just put up an offer to sell for a certain amount for bank transfer and give the buyer of your bitcoin the bank account of the person you are sending money too! it works like Magic and they get 20% more and you only pay less than a 1% fee to Paxful for the escrow!

Found a detailed list of Dividend stocks,"there's an overlap between the things I'd like to invest in like value and paying out dividends but I hate dividends so much from a tax perspective.

Why is the United States so rich?,"The US became a global economic hyper power relatively recently. Basically within the last century. You could probably write multiple books on the topic. Here is just one reason:

After WWII, most other countries had to rebuild all their infrastructure their governments. The US remained relatively untouched in the world wars and became a global exporter to a world that needed to rebuild from the ground up.

As the ""winners"" of the war we also got to set many of the economic rules which obviously is an advantage. 

Again, there are a million other reasons in addition to this."

Dear Europeans you don't need 10mil to Fatfire,"Here for this. I live in a big house in the country in Czech Republic. Average income in my town is about $1000/ month. I have twenty rental units generating net $10K/ month and a few hundred K in stocks. Got to pull off one more job and I can pay off my mortgage this spring. After that I don't particularly see the point of busting my ass anymore. Fat is relative. Of course my assets are laughable compared to a lot of what I see on here, but I can do what I want. University is free here or nearly so - put one kid through film school already for the grand total of $3000/ year. It's not like I need to have $1m parked to put the other three through the bonkers money pit that is US higher education. Single payer health care costs $100/ month per adult, kids are free. Unskilled labor around the house (repairs, cleaners) costs about $5/ hour. I have 6 guys in my house now doing a $10K construction project that would surely cost $50K in the US. We're gonna take January off and park ourselves in a beach villa in Thailand. Probably not ever gonna rent a private plane but still this is fat enough for us."

If healthcare in the USA is privatised why is it so expensive?,"Econtalk had a podcast regarding this. I think that would help explain part of the reason. One point there is that hospitals do not compete exactly the way other firms do. Can you compare and have access to the cost of all the different facilities in your nearby hospitals. I would presume that you can't, and that's a big part of the problem. For most of the hospitals, their consumers are the insurance companies and the govn, this makes the insurance companies really powerful in the usa. There are just two many incentives to showing a higher price than it really is.

Also, there are a few theories that tell us that a few fields in which network effects are enormous (healthcare, sanitation, and education), it makes sense that everyone has free and easy access to those things. I think covid makes that case pretty clear too."
I hit a low point. I stole from target today to make sure my daughter had medicine she needed.,"You should go to your local county office and speak with a case worker to get emergency funds, food, and medical insurance. They have expedited services that can rush things if there's an emergency such as no food or unpaid bills. Start the application online for food stamps and cash aid or whatever your state offers, then either call or speak to a person in the office to make sure it gets rushed.

There are also a number of different donation-based  food and clothing options in most counties. 

As for emergency medicine, go to the ER if the sickness gets worse. A lot of times they can help you get at least some antibiotics or something until insurance becomes available. No amount of accrued medical bills are worth risking a serious illness or death.

Good luck, and I'm sorry for your tough situation. I wish the best for you and daughter."

The Ultimate DD about the CEBE (Counterfeit Electronic Book Entries) created by the SBP (Share Borrow Program) within the DTCC. Written by Dr. Jim DeCosta on a forum from 2006. Want it to get immortalized on Reddit.,"Oh God I wasn't ready for so much confirmation bias so early in the morning. I might need to wash it down with some whiskey. Thank you for your service and enjoy your vacation!

Basically confirms all the aspects of the scam that the US stock market has become. Shortsellers are knowingly diluting the shares and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of downward pressure on the stock price. They are confident DTCC and SEC don't want to rock the boat and they can get away with it, and market makers are happy to participate. Problem is, until longs give up, they have to keep shortselling to maintain the price suppression. Otherwise only way out is through buy-ins. What Jim never imagined is that a bunch of apes would be retarded enough to oppose these crooks who thought of themselves as untouchable.

Best ECONOMICS Books for beginners?,"The usual advice is to start with an introductory textbook. Mankiw's *Principles of Economics* is a typical example; you can pick up a used copy for about $30.

If you want something a little lighter, Tim Harford's *The Undercover Economist* and *The Undercover Economist Strikes Back* are two good pop-econ introductions to the subject.

If you're interested in the history of thought, the go-to introduction is Heilbroner's *The Worldly Philosophers.*

How much longer do I have to live like this for?,"I think you're sacrificing the present too much for the future. You need to find a happier balance where you can enjoy the present without guilt. 

Also: if you've saved at a minimum £600 a month for 5 years, you should have at least £36k at a minimum for a deposit. And assuming the usual mortgage ratios of 4.5, your £40k-£50k salary allows you to borrow £180k-£225k, with your deposit you have a £216k-£261k budget. Is it really impossible to buy a 1-bed place in your area? Genuine query. 

Otherwise, when you say: ""do i just give up and my life?"" - i tend to agree, if you cannot achieve your goals in a realistic time frame than I recommend saving up a massive private pension instead!"
This article perfectly shows how Uber and Lyft are taking advantage of drivers that don't understand the real costs of the business.,"I rode with an Older gentlemen about a year ago in a Lyft.

He told me confidently he nets about $6 USD an hour after all factors considered which seemed pretty spot on. I have asked a lot of drivers if they make good money and most seem to think they do or they are just too embarrassed to admit they don't"

They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT!

Is anyone else struggling for motivation at the moment?,"It's a personal choice and I, along with everyone else you ask, don't know the correct answer for you. 

I do believe that with meaning comes happiness and the best way to find meaning is in responsibility. That could be responsibility in persuing home ownership or rasing a family or it could be in pursuing a goal for yourself and forgoing the more traditional lifestyle. That goal could be anything, travel, career goals, refining a skill or finding a hobby. 

But it's never going to be in abdicating responsibility entirely. That life leads to resentment and bitterness. You're going to suffer in this life no matter what. The sooner you choose what your going to suffer for the sooner you'll attain meaning and it's byproduct,  happiness. The later you leave it the less choice you will have in what it is you'll suffer for, but suffer you will.

I chose family life. I am tight with my family and I want that later in life also with my kids. With that comes certain pressures to provide. Sometimes I need to remind myself that enjoying life with them is more important than stressing over the pressure to provide. 

I have close friends that chose the single life. They travel regularly, always seem fit and well rested. Most of them don't own homes and don't plan to. From my perspective they seem really free. I once told my mate that sometimes I envy his freedom and his response was that he is lonely. 

So I don't know if any of this helps you but I've finished my poo and now I have to go feed the animals, and the kids and fold the washing and pack their lunches and catch up on some emails before I collapse at about 8:30pm."

"Employers desperately searching for staff, but don't want to pay?","""Immigrants are stealing jobs"" - that has been drilled into our heads for _decades_.

In this perfect condition where borders are shut and this access to 'cheap labour' is cut off. Finally, we are waking up to what has always been going on the whole time:

Many employers are underpaying workers: Australians _and_ foreigners. 

So of course they'll go to the media to complain about not being able to get their cheap and desperate foreign workers getting paid a sub-par salary when Australians know what's fair and what's rubbish. These same employers will want to lobby for immigration to be increased to continue what benefits only them directly. 

We need more regulation against underpayment and to penalise employers who underpay.

Edit: Immigrants aren't the problem. Dodgy employers underpaying their staff are the problem.

Are new investors making a huge mistake starting out in this market? (Serious answers only please),"I learned very early on that the market will quickly humble you if you are going to bet big on a ""sure thing"". It's gambling plain and simple.    

There are many different methods to day trading that can be done successfully. Basically I call this educated gambling. It takes a lot of time and a lot of effort and you still lose sometimes. The trick is to always minimize that potential loss. 

The most success I have had is with a balanced, low fee, dividend paying etf portfolio.    
Yeah it's not as exciting as the day trader life or net you that one big win so you can go out and buy a Bentley.

Be very aware of the words you use when speaking over yourself. Because it is going to take a lot of hard work and self belief to get there. 

Should. Have to. Need. Must. Can’t. 

Forget about those words. They will only make you more neurotic. Substitute your attitude from ""I should"" to ""I consciously and freely chose this behavior because it serves me best right now""

""Ugh, I have to wash the dishes."" No, you don't. Totally untrue. You can use dirty dishes, or no dishes. ""I need to wash the dishes."" No, you don't. That's not a need.
""I should wash the dishes."" According to whom? Yourself? Then what you're doing is burying a ""want"" under a pile of self-pitying delusion and coercive language. If you look at those dirty dishes and correct yourself to say, “Right now I want to
have clean dishes."" life becomes so much less aggravating. It's liberating - and often more accurate - to reformulate your thoughts as want statements.

The way we speak is the way we think. What we think is formed by our beliefs. Make sure that your beliefs serve you, and don’t limit you. The words we use matter a lot!

Why (exactly) is MMT wrong?,"The biggest issue is that despite calling itself a ""theory"", MMT really doesn't act like a scientific theory at all.

What are your go-to materials for your investment properties?,"I rehab a few properties a year, most full renovations with and average budget of about 50-70k (though I just finished one that was 135k an entire gut with major structural changes).

This question is super location specific (like neighborhood specific). Where I invest, in a midsized East Coast city (Pittsburgh), B+/- City neighborhoods, I am able to use higher end finishes, hit the top tier of rent, and still stay within 70% ARV (many areas /neighborhoods of my city don’t allow for anything over builder grade finishes, But I stay out of those. Some neighborhoods are very expensive and the cap rate and cash flow are terrible, I stay out of those for the most part too). Most of my renovations are single-family homes and I hold them as rentals (brrrr), though I also mess with small mf. The average house I do is a purchase price of around 60K, and an ARV of about 150-175k that brings in an average of ~$1650/month in rent (where the overall market average is ~$1100/month for properties that aren’t updated). I guess it’s a little harder for me to find properties because my renovations cost a little more and I’m always very conservative in my numbers. But I’d rather be slow and profitable than fast and broke.

I use higher end finishes (rather than builder grade) because they wear better, I can command a higher rent, and a subsequently get more qualified renters, usually young professionals, so I weed out a lot of the riffraff. I’ve never had an evection we’ll put it that way..

I don’t like carpet, I typically go for hardwood floors, in my city a lot of the housing stock is 100 years old and all have hardwood floors that have been protected by carpet for decades that I am able to refinish. If I’m not I typically use oak or walnut 5 inch wide planks for main living areas, and will sometimes carpet bedrooms. I use LVP in basement bathrooms.
 
**don’t ever buy flooring from lumber liquidators, whatever you do, go anywhere else. They are unscrupulous, with multiple class action lawsuits to prove it. Don’t lose your money into them**

I use white subway tile (4”x12”) for shower and bath tub surrounds which I almost always tile, rather than getting the cheap acrylic surround. It really makes a big difference in the final look. 

I use white subway tile (3”x6”) for the backsplash in the kitchen too. I get the more expensive grout that doesn’t require a sealer and usually A light gray or beige shade. I’ve had issues with stained grout in rentals.

I use tile for the bathroom floors, and recently have been using the hexagon marble sheets. It’s a little expensive, but in a 30-40 square-foot bathroom it’s not that bad and it looks super high end. Otherwise I use ceramic or porcelain large format tile.

I buy ForeverMark cabinets (and accompanying crown molding and trim), varying colors depending on the look of the rehab. It’s all ply construction (no particle board garbage), and they’re well-made for cheaper cabinets.

I always install granite or quartz countertops, for the cost (1-2K) It’s always worth it. A go for the granite that’s on sale though usually are around $30-$35 per square foot.

I get all stainless steel appliances, usually cheap range, dishwasher, microwave, and I’ll spend up to $1000 on a fridge (Pro tip, always get the extended warrantee offered on the fridge. The rest of the appliances don’t matter, but the fridge does. They usually cost $80-$100, and will Save your butt. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a fridge break right after the year mark of the factory warranty LOL.)

I go for all wood vanities (if I can find them, and I get the cheapest I can find, usually about $400) and matching vanity mirrors. I do everything I can to stay away from things that are made out of particleboard and mdf.

I get midrange plumbing fixtures (usually moen, Either brushed nickel or rubbed bronze depending on the look of the rehab). You should find a plumbing supplier around you. Big box stores carry the same plumbing fixtures, but they’re made differently and they’re cheaper. The components inside, the gaskets, are typically plastic. The ones from the plumbing supply store have rubber, ceramic, and metal components. They’ll also have shut off valves integral in the shower diverter. That means you don’t need An access panel behind them, you just takeoff the face plate and you can shut off the water to repair. It’s usually a A little more expensive, but worth it to not be paying a plumber to come replace them. You need to have shut off valves on all plumbing Fixtures, so if it’s in a spot where you can’t have an access panel, it allows you to meet code. I use delta foundations toilets that are about $150

For bedrooms and main areas I use the 13” flush mount edge lit lights (if we didn’t put in recessed lighting). I get cheap lantern style LED lights for the exterior. I will usually get a nicer fixture for an entryway or kitchen (If it doesn’t have recessed cans) But I wont spend over $70 on that. That’s one of those things that is an eyecatcher. I get whatever vanity flights are the cheapest but fit the look. I usually spend about $30-$40 on vanity lights.

I get the 5 1/4 inch baseboard, quarter round, and 3 1/2 inch window and door casings.

I usually add AC if it doesn’t have one, or add a furnace and AC if it has an old boiler system. Its worth the cost to me. I’ve been putting in Goodman furnaces and AC, which are significantly cheaper than Lennox and carrier, But have a good warranty and perform well.

I use Sherwin-Williams paints (I have a pro account with them and get their 200 line for about the same cost as the house brands of big box stores, and it’s far superior) and do an eggshell flat white ceiling, beige, gray or light blue walls, and Swiss coffee for trim.

About 3/4 of the time I need to put in new windows. I get the cheapest vinyl replacement windows that usually cost about $166 each (though they cost more if I need it to be obscured or tempered). I get them installed and the exterior capped for about $100-$130 each.

I use faux-wood 2” plantation style blinds. Cost between $25 and $45 each. Very durable and look fantastic.

I use timberline or BP Everest architectural shingles for roofs. Roofs usually cost about $400-450/square depending on the roof and site conditions.

I often use a (cheap) nice fiberglass shaker with 6-pane window front door that are usually about $350 at Lowe’s, And the stock steel half light exterior doors for anything else.

I put a keypad deadlock on every house. Makes letting contractors in, and changing tenants, a breeze.

If I need to do stair railing’s, I use a wrought iron interior pre-fabricated railing. I found a local guy who has a forge. The average cost is about $500, it’s not only cheaper than buying railing, balusters, Newell posts, etc. It also saves a massive amount of labor (he welds stock steel together, Paints it with a black enamel, and spends 15 minutes bolting it in), and I think it looks much better/cleaner. It’s much more sturdy as well.

For decks and exterior railings I always just use treated lumber. But with the cost of treated lumber right now, it’s almost comparable to using trex composite decking, so I may switch that up.

There’s a bunch of stuff I’m forgetting and every rehab is different, but those are the major things. I’ll add more if I think of it.

Again, this is super location specific. I’m able to do tile and nicer floors, and not have to buy builder grade cabinets, because my rehabs will allow for the extra cost. I do spend a *significant* amount of time getting materials, Working with contractors and shopping around to make sure that I’m staying in Budget.

Edit: not materials, but definitely renovation cost related. I recently bought a 5 x 10 dump trailer. I’ll still get large dumpsters for the demo if we need it, but then I’m able to park that dump trailer out front, I don’t have to get permits, and I’m not getting charged per day for a dumpster. So when it’s just for excess material from the renovation, it saves me a lot of money. Around me a 12 yard dumpster cost about $450 for 2 tons of material and seven days of use. After that you start getting charged $15 a day, and for any overage on the tonnage. It really adds up.

Why can't governments simply subsidize r&amp;d and investment in green energy by heavily taxing CO2 emissions?,"Check put the r/ economics faq on carbon pricing which answers your questions pretty well
https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_carbonpricing

In summary, carbon taxes (or cap and trade) are extremely popular among economists as the best climate solutions.
It also matters a lot less what you spend the money raised on. It’s far more important that there’s a cost for emitting greenhouse emissions, than there being subsidies for green solutions.

It basically is that simple... until you bring politics into it."

41 acre property for sale with potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in timber for harvest.,"You won't get that much for only 40 acres worth of timber. Best thing you can do is lock it up under contract with a due diligence period then hire a forester to do a quick estimation of marketable timber value AND management plan for the residual stand after harvest. FYI if you cut every dollar of timber off a place, the land will usually be destroyed forever or a very long time. Unless it's a pine stand.

Why are high end salaries in the US so high?,"There is a lot of interesting work done on this. Good Economics for Hard Times by Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee discusses ballooning salaries as the result of very low top marginal tax rates after Regan’s presidency and tax reforms. Additionally, many of those top salaries are in the finance sector, and since many of those jobs are in located in New York and London those high salaries would also be located there. Low top marginal tax rates is a large factor in why those salaries are uniquely American, and are not present in other OECD countries.

How do I know if I really understand a company?,"Here is a checklist. I assembled it from different resources -  for example Rule #1 Investing by Phil Town, and a lot of things from Twitter: 
Long post:

- Koyfin: Screen fundamentals

- Wikipedia: Read Story behind their company

- Company Site: What they do

- Seeking Alpha: Latest ""analysis"", Check if there is a VIC analysis

- SEC Site: Read 10k and 10Q

- Check Dataroma how many are holding the company

- Figure out the business Risks

- Ask yourself if you know what the market doesn't

- Is the price inferior to the value that you are getting?


I also always try to answer these questions:


##Be capable of understanding

- [ ] Is this company inside my Circle of Competence?

- [ ] Are any of my Gurus buying or selling this company?

- [ ] What is my overall level of confidence with my research into this company?

- [ ] Describe the business and industry in one paragraph.

- [ ] Describe the challenges and economic cycles of this industry.

- [ ] What are the company's plans for growth?

- [ ] Will growth peak within ten years?




## Moat

- [ ] What is the Moat?

- [ ] How hard is it to compete with this company?

- [ ] Compare this company to its competition.

- [ ] What are the Big Four Growth Rates (Net Income, Book Value, Sales, Operating Cash)? Are they speeding up or slowing down?

- [ ] Does the company have enough cash to last several year if it looses money?

- [ ] How were sales and earnings during the last recession?


## Management


- [ ] Does the CEO have integrity?

- [ ] How candid is the CEO's letter to shareholders?

- [ ] Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well but clam up or disclaim responsibility when trouble occurs?

- [ ] How are the Return on Equity and Return on Invested Capital Numbers of the year?"
Is the crypto boom still worth investing in?,"Personally, I would suggest at least a small allocation to your portfolio. Crypto is starting to be seen as an emerging asset rather than speculative one. Although projects like Dogecoin don’t help with that progress, there are plenty of projects that have real world applications and is why more big players are taking an interest in allocating into the market. It’s highly volatile and high risk, and you have to avoid the common emotional reaction to common large dips and general market cycles. Just my opinion."
Is investing addictive?,"It can be as addictive as gambling. I've become mildly obsessed with it, myself. Mainly because I'm sick of employment and intent on building a dividend portfolio to the point where I don't need to work anymore. The sooner the better."
Is anyone here conflicted about investing in companies that make the world a worse place?,"&gt;I'm just genuinely curious: do a lot of the investor world just genuinely not care about these things or are people content to make small gains on the backs of companies that they don't agree with?

They stop disagreeing with them if they make money on their stocks.   


EDIT : I believe this was brought up in this thread but most of us buy stocks on the secondary market (i.e. trade shares among investors) and not the primary market (IPOs and the like). On the secondary market you don't really give capital to the company as much as to whomever you buy/sale from."

"India has been doing direct fiscal transfer for almost a decade now, it is called MGNREGA","Jan dhan initiative and aadhar both have been crafted to lay the foundation for direct benefits transfer.

The latest is Govt transferring MSP price directly to farmers (though this is not subsidy or a freebie). But givt will use the same mechanism to send relief to farmers, same system is used by many states. 

The key thing is you have to qualify for subsidies and handouts while in US the qualifying criteria was you have to be a taxpayer or unemployed since they got stimulus check via that mechanism."
Prenup advice — marrying into wealthy family,"Fair means both sides have something at stake. 


1.  Have a 5 year provision that everyone leaves with everything thing that they came in with if the marriage lasts less than this time. Most failed marriages fail early. 

2. Put a no alimony provision in if you want to protect your post marriage income stream. 

3. If the father wants to be party to the marriage then  marry him - otherwise back out. 

4. If half your future income is at risk, so too does half the assets (or at least revenue generated by the assets)."

The wealthiest 10% of Americans own a record 89% of all U.S. stocks,"This data point is revealing how poorly understood data is. Specifically, it shows that many people do not understand how to recognize what a statistic does *or does not* demonstrate. 

The metric cited is not about participation (% of people who own some stock). It’s about consolidation of value. Even this isn’t damning. As a few people have pointed out, the statistic looks the way it does because of founders’ ownership stakes and similar early investor holdings (example: the PayPal Mafia). 

As these founders have become wealthy by growing these wildly profitable companies, anyone with a 401(k) or solid portfolio has also benefitted by way of their own holdings increasing in value."
Best way to invest in hummus?,"Lol, wut? I love hummus too, but....

Why isn’t economics taught with calculus as a prerequisite?,"Because you can teach the intuition behind almost all microeconomic concepts without an actual knowledge of calculus.

And fundamentally that's the most important thing people should take away from their first micro course.  They aren't going to remember how to use a lagrange multiplier to to solve for a consumer's optimal bundle of goods 10 years later (hell, I'm a professional ""economist"" and I'd fail my calc-based ECON200 midterm exam if you made me take it today)...but if you can teach them to think in terms of scarcity, costs/benefits, supply/demand, and still remember some of the big takeaways 10 years later, then you have won.  

That said, some universities will let you do an entire econ degree without requiring calculus.  I think that takes it too far.  Learning the intuition behind elasticity and marginal benefits without calculus is totally possible, but if you want to go deeper (like getting a degree), you need the tools.  Also, you kind of need calc for macro.  You can sneak your way through the basics by teaching some very basic calc and just having people memorize the formula for some simple derivatives (basically just memorize the derivatives of cobb-douglas) and you can teach a pretty decent macro course, but beyond a 101 course I think that's insufficient.

Anecdotally, I'll offer two observations.

1. When I did my undergrad, it was optional to take the true intro micro/macro classes before diving into the 200-level degree-required courses that were heavy on math and absolutely required calculus.  There was a noticeable difference between the kids who took the ""suggested"" 100-level classes (very well taught but no calculus, all intuition-driven, multiple choice exams, etc.) and the kids who dove right into the major requirements.  A lot of kids who skipped the 100s really struggled with economic intuition.  They could do the calculus and solve the equations, but the 200s classes spent so much time on math that it was hard to develop ""big picture"" intuition on how the concepts came together without some prior background.
2. Best micro class I ever took was the hardest of the 3 micro options offered during my MBA--so called ""turbo micro"".  It was taught by Kevin Murphy and was essentially the first part of the UChicago PhD Price Theory (micro) course but with all of the calculus/hard math stripped out (because you know, MBAs can't do math).  Like literally same exam questions that PhD students would get--there's a study guide floating around with past answers from the PhD exam (i'll try to find a link, I got it from PhD friends, but I know it is online)...just ignore any questions with math/formulas/calculus and it becomes a study guide for the MBA exam.  The class was 100% intuition and despite having tons of past career/educational economics experience, I learned an incredible amount from the course.  Learning to *think* like an economist is honestly harder (and more important) than learning basic calculus. In terms of my day-to-day work and thought, that class taught me more than any of the calculus-based classes from my Econ degree."
Do the billionaires actually have the money?,"You are correct that the value is similar to an appraisal, but it makes sense to count it that way. If I have $50 in cash, but a $100,000 house, it wouldn't make sense to appraise my net worth at $50, because if I needed to I could liquidate the house and have about $100,000 soon.

So instead of thinking about it as billionaires paying for things, think about it as the government paying for things and sending billionaires a bill in the form of higher taxes. Sure, they may not have enough cash to pay the whole bill, but they can sell some of their assets to come up with the money soon.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the part of the question about Jeff paying employees less, it's a bit complicated and multifaceted, so I'll just start at the beginning.

The most fundamental reason why a person might want to buy a share of a company in the first place is because that ownership portion of the company would eventually start paying them a portion of the profits, also known as a dividend. They get to keep their ownership share which they can sell at any time, and at some point in the future, the company will stop reinvesting all of its profits into the business and start giving some of the profits to the owners. Large financial markets like the stock market are more influenced by speculation than dividends, but the shares wouldn't be worth anything, and speculation would be moot if there wasn't a future expectation of dividends.

Profit = revenue - cost, so companies hoping to maximize profit have an obvious incentive to keep costs like employee salaries low to maximize those profits. Jeff is the CEO, so he gets to decide what his employees will earn.

Since Jeff is also the largest shareholder in his company, his assets would be directly affected by the loss of profit associated with raising wages. If the company no longer has the same ability to generate profits, speculators on the stock market decide it isn't worth as much anymore because its potential to pay future dividends is diminished. They want to sell their shares, but potential buyers also know that the company isn't as capable of producing profits anymore so now buyers are only willing to buy the shares if they can buy them at a lower price. If this happens the stock that Jeff owns isn't worth as much as it once was because if he wanted to liquidate it, he'd have to sell it at a lower price.

So it's not as if Jeff would be writing checks from his personal bank account to his employees. Instead, Jeff's decision to raise employee wages would cause the assets that he owns to become less valuable, lowering his net worth."
Is Tipping Good or Bad,"Tipping is a surprisingly complex and nuanced phenomenon, from an economics point of view. There are many factors to consider. Does tipping have a significant impact on the quality of service? Does tipping result in higher or lower wages? Does tipping have the benefit of giving customers a sense of control and generosity? Is tipping unfair and inequitable?

These questions are examined in a recent paper called, [""The Economics of Tipping""](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.2.215), and it will do much better justice to these topics than anyone can in a reddit reply. This excerpt from the conclusion will give you a sense of the complexity as well as the lack of economic consensus on the topic:

&gt;Tipping is for obvious reasons a subject of controversy. A social norm that dictates a tip as a percentage of the bill doesn’t seem to make intuitive sense: opening a $100 bottle of wine does not require quadruple the effort of opening a $25 bottle of wine, and bringing a $40 steak is not four times as tiring as bringing a $10 pasta. Critics have argued that tipping enforces archaic and undesirable social distinctions and that it facilitates discrimination in who holds what jobs in a restaurant, as well as encouraging sexual harassment (Ferdman 2016).  A number of writers have expressed a negative attitude towards tipping or even called to abolish it (for example, Porter 2013; Keane 2014; S.K. 2015; Grimminck 2015; Dixon 2016).  
&gt;  
&gt;The discussion and evidence in this paper suggests a more nuanced view. Perhaps some restaurants, under a certain kind of management and with a certain kind of reputation, could benefit by replacing tipping with a fixed service charge or with higher menu prices. Indeed, some restaurant owners strongly believe that replacing tipping with a fixed service charge, distributed among both servers and kitchen help, led to a better quality of food, improved team spirit, and ultimately resulted in a higher level of professionalism and better service—even if some previously high-tipped servers experienced a fall in income (for example, see Porter 2013).  
&gt;  
&gt;However, at many other restaurants, the social norm of tipping has been reasonably robust. Many customers prefer the control of choosing a tip and have a positive feeling that they are showing generosity. Servers earn more as a result and find that busy shifts where they have to work harder are rewarded with higher income. Service quality seems modestly higher. It seems likely that restaurant owners, tempted by the tip rents being earned by servers, will continue to experiment with ways of recapturing some of those rents—either to redistribute to kitchen workers or to raise profits. Perhaps the self-reinforcing social norm of tipping will be toppled eventually in the United States, but with more than a century of history, it seems unlikely to go quickly."
I recently had an epiphany about how little a million dollars is today compared to what I thought when I was growing up.,"It’s funny because if it weren’t for the exorbitantly priced real estate in my city, my current mid-7 figure NW would allow me to live a proper “millionaire lifestyle” but then again, if it weren’t for exorbitantly priced real estate I wouldn’t have a net-worth."

"So... ""WTF happened in 1971""?","I wrote the reply on BadEconomics that several others have linked to. I think this is a good opportunity to refresh that reply.  The site has changed a little, in some ways it has improved.  I have updated a few of the descriptions below and used links rather than numbering the graphs.

So, 1971 marked the end of the Bretton Woods agreement. Now, some of the things shown on that site are related to the end of the Bretton Woods agreement. Others aren't though, they're probably coincidences. Some are misleading. In general the site is misleading and I think deliberately so.

Bretton Woods wasn't really the Gold Standard. It was a somewhat similar but not really the same. Gold didn't actually circulate as coinage. That made it more similar to the *Gold Exchange Standard*. That is, a system where gold is used as reserves by banks but not as money.

The holding of monetary gold by US citizens was prohibited at that time, and there were many limitations on the import and export of gold. So it wasn't really a full Gold Exchange Standard either. By the end of the Bretton Woods agreement the only parties that were really allowed to exchange dollars for monetary gold were other Central Banks. What it did effectively though was to lock the exchange rate of other countries to the dollar. But it did not lock the value of the dollar to gold effectively.

* International Trade.

Some of the graphs are marked ""Bretton Woods agreement"" for the period before 1971. They're then marked ""Liberalization of International trade"" for the period after. Now, trade liberalization started well before Bretton Woods ended and tariffs were already quite low when it ended. It continued afterwards and to the present day. The two aren't strongly related. Trade liberalization probably has little to do with any of the graphs.

* Inflation.

[There](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/cambells-soup.jpg) [are](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cummulative-inflation.jpg) [several](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/img_0681_arrow-1.jpg?w=780) [graphs](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/cpi-basket-1.png) on inflation, I've linked to them in the first few words of this sentence. This is something that really is related to the end of Bretton Woods. The agreement put certain limitations on US monetary policy. After it ended those limitations ended. A floating exchange rate regime that came into existence afterwards. After that the Fed could create more money and price inflation was higher. That was especially true in the 70s just after Bretton Woods ended. Notice the several of the graphs are just different ways of estimating of inflation.

The graphs of [currencies in terms of the price of gold](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/img_1376.png) or just dollar [gold price](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/us_gold_reserves.png) also don't show anything unexpected.  That is just another way of estimating inflation, like using the price of Campbell's soup.

* Hyperinflation in other countries and Banking Crises.

When the Bretton Woods system ended it was replaced with floating exchange rates.  That gave governments much more freedom.  They no longer needed by publically declare a ""devaluation"" in order to devalue their currencies.

As we know, governments are often not very responsible, especially in developing countries.  Hence the number of episodes of [hyperinflation increased](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/do5g42luuae65cp_1.jpg?w=1024).  As did [currency crashes](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/currency-crashes.png?w=1024) which are associated with high inflation and hyperinflation.

It is also probably true, in my opinion, that there's a connection in [the graph on banking crises](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/grasp_brettonwoodstitled_arrow-1.jpg).

So, in my opinion these charts show something real.

* Inflation and Saving.

[This graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/savings_gdp.jpg) shows net saving as a percentage of GNI.  Now, all else being equal inflation discourages saving.  So, I think this is partly true.  I think what we're seeing here is partly an effect of the end of Bretton Woods.

In the long run investment closely matches savings.  Also, though, as economies mature the opportunites for physical investment can decrease.  Investment in human capital becomes more important.  This is the another cause of that change.

We should remember that most saving is *gross* but not *net*.  People save during their working lives then spend during their retirement.  From the point-of-view of the saver, gross saving provides most of the good things from saving.  Net saving is a cherry on top.

The site also gives [personal savings](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/savingsrate.jpg).  It is worth looking at the entire range of [that graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT).  Notice that it has recovered quite significantly since 2008.  There was also a great deal of saving during COVID restrictions, probably because employed people simply had less opportunity to spend.  We also have to remember that people own non-personal savings too.  Shareholder of firms own those firms and therefore assets of those firms.

* National Debt (and also Oil).

Here is when we get to the troublesome parts.  Next we have [this graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/eifme9yu0ae8xnz.jpg?w=457) of national debt and [this one](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/roundcube.png?w=1024). Notice that both times it's national debt in dollars. It's not compensated for inflation. As a result the higher inflation that I mentioned above caused the national debt to increase in size when measured in dollars.  The same is true of [this graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/bank-assets.jpg) which seems to measure US commercial bank assets that are US government securities, though it's not well labelled.

If you look at the [two](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/federdebtheldbypublic2021.jpg) [graphs](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/federaldebtpublic.jpg) just above it the story is much different. That's because those graphs are GDP adjusted. In those graphs the highest national debt occurred at the end of WWII.

The graph of [oil price](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ewuc3gru0auouse.jpeg-1.jpg) has the same problem.  It's in nominal terms.  So, of course oil has risen in price.  It's surprising that it hasn't risen further.

Notice on [this graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/federdebtheldbypublic2021.jpg) that the area to the left of the dashed line is a projection. What reason do we have to believe this projection?  This all depends on how responsible politicians are with budgets.  They may be irresponsible, but that doesn't have much to do with the Bretton Woods system.

The other graphs aren't really related to the end of Bretton Woods at all. Or the relationship is very indirect.

* House Prices

This part of the wtfhappenedin1971 site has really been improved.  However, there are still several problems for the narrative it presents.

The first thing to understand here is that houses have improved over the years.  As a result, average home prices do not measure the same thing across time.  The average US house is much larger and have much more facilities than one made in 1950 or 1971.

[This graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/efkgav8wwaenvoc.png) shows house prices in New York and Boston.  It should be no surprise what it looks like.  We know that those cities have become much more prominent recently and demand to live in them has risen.  In the 70s crime in New York was huge, it's no surprise that house prices were low.  Comparisons like this using specific cities are not very interesting.

[This one](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ey_zm2fwsamocf9-1.png) shows house prices compared to the minimum wage.  The shape of this should be no surprise.  When adjusted for inflation the minimum wage has fallen over the past few decades.  Also, the number of people who actually earn the minimum wage is less than 2% of the workforce.  Using the minimum wage as a denominator is a poor decision.

[Then](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/mortgagepaymentspercentincome-1.png) we have a graph of house prices in *Australia*.  Of course, Australia is famous for high house prices.  This tells us very little in general.  The rest of the site is focused on the US, so why does it bring Australia in the picture here?  I think only because the chart tells the story that they want.

Lastly there's [this graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/e8j1qysxsai4g5d.jpg?w=589).  I can't repeat this one using FRED data.  However, if I use medians then that produces a graph [that's rising](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=INqT).  Like I said at the start though, we have to remember that houses are much bigger and better then they were.

I also can't find anything close to [this graph](https://wtfhappenedin1971home.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/unknown.jpg?w=581).  It looks to me that whoever made this is measuring income wrongly. Which brings me to...."

Does a UBI cause inflation in the long run?,"In the long run, inflation is determined by monetary policy decisions of the central bank. So, a UBI will not generate long-run inflation.

Many of the comments that I didn't approve claim that it depends on whether or not the UBI is funded through deficit spending or taxes (with a deficit-funded UBI leading to inflation and a tax-funded one not). I think it's more accurate to say that a deficit-funded UBI would lead to *inflationary pressure* that the central bank would have to act to offset. But as long as the central bank chooses to keep inflation on target, there would be no inflationary effect (barring short-run errors in monetary policy, but these disappear in the long run). Such a phenomenon is commonly referred to as ""monetary offset"".

The edge-case here is that if the deficit induced by the UBI is so large that it threatens the solvency of the country. In this case, the government may choose to force the central bank to print money and ""monetize the debt"" which would lead to inflation. Here, the UBI isn't really ""causing"" inflation so-to-speak, but rather is forcing the governments hand to implement a different policy that induces inflation."
How successful is Michael Burry at trading stocks? (data inside),"Analyzing a stock picker's moves is a little bit like analyzing a poker player, without access to the hole cards of the players at the table.

It can be done, but even a practiced professional will require *so many hands* played to achieve any sort of certainty about a player's skill.

Of course this becomes significantly easier if we can see every players hole cards, but we cannot see Michael Burry's hole cards. We're also talking about real life, and not a game with a defined set of outcomes. Infinitely more complicated.

We don't have access to every opportunity he's investigated and said No.

We don't have access to the complete information set available to Burry on opportunities where he has said Yes.

We don't have access to the true odds of each outcome, all potential outcomes, and a weighted expectation estimate from Burry of which outcomes he thought were possible, and what rough probability he assigned to each when making a decision.

If we're being honest, all we have are his track record and some anecdotal commentary he might share, here and there. That's the same story with most investors.

That's why it often takes 5, 10 or 15 years for skill to really become undeniable. Some skilled players will get lucky earlier in their careers and some will get unlucky, but sooner or later the good and bad fortune evens out and the skill shows through.

What is your favorite economics paper?,"[Glaeser &amp; Gyourko (2018)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.1.3), JEP. Very intuitive way to think about housing costs. Also a fairly easy (non-technical) read.

&gt;In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth, and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications."

Dallas considers restricting home sales for investors,"Large investment groups with hundreds of billion to trillions of dollars have decided that single family homes are investable assets. They are doing so to increase their return rates by a few percent.

JP Morgan announces a 11% dividend increase,I know it doesnt compare with other banks but JPM has been vocal about waiting for an opportunity due to inflation and this falls in line with it. I'm hopeful for a special dividend later this year or Q1'22 if their thesis turns out to be wrong.

Investing in the Green Industrial Revolution,"Your comments on wind seem off and sorry for long post but I spend a lot of time looking at this. 

SSE are to my knowledge not involved in NnG but Edf (who bought it from mainstream) and ESB who last year bought a share in the project. SSE and Equinor recently reached FID on Dogger bank A&amp;B which is a 2.4GW project and each sold a 10% share in the project to Eni for £200m. 

SSE are also building a new Combined cycle gas turbine which is due to come online in 2022. I'm not adverse to that but one to be aware of as some people may not want in invest in that. 

Looking further afield RWE is the second largest offshore wind player in world and has significant presence in UK with likes of Galloper, London array and the upcoming Triton Knoll. After its merger with EOn renewables last year it has a diverse generation portfolio and is active globally in conventional and renewable energy. 

Iberdrola (owner of Scottish Power) is also one to look at due to a vast onshore wind portfolio and growing offshore presence. The East Anglia set of projects will bring upto 3GW of capacity with the first 700MW coming online last year.  

Vestas also became a more interesting proposition recently due to it acquiring a 25% stake in Copenhagen infrastructure partners who are one of the largest renewable focused investment managers. 

Octopus investment trust is linked only in name to the Octopus energy retail supplier, the majority of the £3bn in energy from Octopus is in PE/EIS funds. For exposure to Octopus energy company, Origin Energy (list on the Asx in Australia) is your best bet as they acquired 20% last year for $500m."
"Why is real leather so rare and expensive, if millions of cows are being killed every day for food?","If this post doesn't get removed for breaking Rule V (which it should imo but I'll leave it up to the discretion of more senior mods), there are a few components you need to consider here:

First, you've accurately identified a glut of actual animal skins. There simply aren't enough people who want real leather compared to synthetics that not all of the cowhides can be used. It is well documented that [cowhides will get discarded ](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/777031319/whats-the-beef-the-declining-american-leather-industry)in absence of purchasers.

This is not the only intermediate good of a leather product, just like the food is not the only cost of eating at a restaurant or steel is not the only cost of making a car. Consider the process of making the highly desirable [chromexcel ](https://www.horween.com/blog/2010/03/23/chromexcel%C2%AE-2) leather. Not only is it very time consuming but also labor intensive. Especially since many leather tanneries operate in developed countries, these labor costs are actually quite high. Thus it's not entirely clear that the cost of leather is abnormally high.

Lastly, it's not actually readily apparent that real leather is more ecologically conservative. Tanning requires many many harmful chemicals that leech into the environment not are they fully able to be properly disposed of. It's difficult to compare the ecological impacts of plastic waste vs chemical waste (as well as there is a lot of heterogeneity in how long people will hold onto pleather vs leather goods). Thus, there is really no metric that can be used to convincingly declare that one option is more ecological than the other. Anything else is simply prax.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 30/May/2017,"Mandarin speaking household here - we're scanning Sina Weibo (China's version of Twitter) right now for sentiment regarding Ethereum launching on OKCoin and Huobi tonight. I don't read Chinese well so I'm relying on telling family members what to search for and having them read to me so it's not super efficient.

There is a moderate volume of comments but it's not a trending tag sitewide so I can't really say just how much there is. I don't think this is the main place for discussion, just like the focus in the west is on Reddit rather than Twitter. I don't know of any Chinese discussion forums for crypto yet, but if someone can point me in the right direction that would be appreciated.

Chinese investors are discussing things much like Western forums are with the same understanding of the market and the same amount of trolls. Sentiment is exceedingly bearish on BTC (Bi Te Bi), there was a warning that ETC was ""fake"" and to be careful not to purchase it, and very bullish on Eth (Yi Tai Bi) along with a little love for ZCash (Jia Mi Bi) because of JPMorgan's involvement.

People are saying Ethereum will become much more valuable than Bitcoin and have mentioned that it has risen from $8 to $220 USD just since late last year. There are comments about its surging market cap and market share as well as it replacing the aging technology of Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin dominance is down to 45% cited in multiple posts. Also, there are a whole lot of people not into crypto who are responding to these comments saying they don't get it and wondering what Ether truly derives its value from. Also a few trolls saying Vitalik looks nerdy and making ""fuck your mom"" jokes based on the fact that the ""Bi"" in YiTaiBi sounds a lot like a character for lady parts.

The EEA members supporting the technology are mentioned and cited as a reason for Ethereum's legitimacy as well as why ETC is fake. 

So, I don't think this is the main place for crypto discussion, but it's a start and it seems clear to me that Chinese crypto investors are just as crazy and up to speed on the details as we are. People are excited about the launch, but we'll have to wait and see what that translates into in terms of trade volume.

YiTaiBi Jia You!"

You only lose money when you pull out. It’s not about timing the market as much as it’s about time in the market.,"This ""bear market sky is falling"" is just like a drug for some people. If your investing plan completely shits the bed the moment the market drops, you didn't have a plan, you had irrational hopes.

And if this downturn, which by the way is going to happen over and over, catches you off guard and screws you over, you had shitty risk management.

Chasing returns and chasing yields works great until it completely implodes. Nobody can predict the future. So make a plan that assumes the future will do random and weird shit once in a while.

"LinkedIn announces 1,000 layoffs ahead of MSFT earnings","ITT: No one understands how LinkedIn makes money.

People primarily think of LinkedIn as a social media website, but they've got a [huge B2B side](https://business.linkedin.com/) that sells hiring and sales solutions for companies.

* Want to hire people? LinkedIn has the richest data on people's skillsets and job search activity. This helps hiring teams reach out and close candidates faster. 
* Want to sell your B2B SaaS product? LinkedIn shows where different people are in an organization and what they do. For example, if you're trying to sell Salesforce, you'll know if you're talking to the CTO, Director of Sales, or a Sales Rep, and be able to position your pitch accordingly.

So while LinkedIn does many a good chunk of change from advertising on their social media platform, they have a huge sales team that sells these SaaS solutions to other businesses."

I dont understand how leveraged ETFs can make you lose money if they reflect the market and you still own the share,"Leveraged ETFs lose money due to volatility, a phenomenon called beta decay, slippage, or volatility decay.

The 3x multiplier of a fund like TQQQ does not apply to the long-term return. Rather, it applies to the _daily_ return, because the leverage resets daily.

For example, let's assume both QQQ and TQQQ start at $100 (the prices don't matter, this is just an example), then this happens:

| Day | QQQ | Change | Total return | TQQQ | Change | Total return |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 0 | $100 | | 0% | $100 | | 0% |
| 1 | $90 | -10% | -10% | $70 | -30% | -30% |
| 2 | $100 | +11.11% | 0% | $93.33 | +33.33% | -7% |

Even though QQQ completely recovered on day 2, TQQQ did not. In fact, TQQQ would have to rise 42.86% in order to recover, which means that when QQQ drops 10%, it has to rise 14.29% the next day for TQQQ to recover.

If the market _only_ goes up, there's no risk. But that's not what happens in real life.

Over time, leveraged funds like TQQQ and UPRO have had enormous growth, but also enormous drawdowns. It's ultimately a very risky bet that will see extreme drops at various times, but also times of recovery."
What’s the point of “rigorous” math in Economics?,"As always - check the sidebar FAQs!!!

From the '[economic methodology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_methods)' FAQ:


&gt;**Why do economists use complicated math? Do they have physics envy?**

&gt;Economists use models, just like other scientists. Economists formulate models using math because math gives our models clarity and consistency.

&gt;Clarity means you know exactly what a model defines, assumes, and concludes. Marxists are still debating what Marx actually meant. No one debates what Kenneth Arrow actually meant, because his statements were in precise mathematical terms.

&gt;Consistency means my premises are guaranteed to entail my conclusion. The math forces me to lay my assumptions bare and derive testable conclusions from them. There’s no ambiguity over what I’m assuming. All (publishable) mathematical models are logically consistent.

&gt;So economists aren’t using math just for the sake of appearances.

I'd suggest giving the whole thing a read.  It explains clearly why economists use the models they do, even when those models might not be 100% realistic:

&gt;Simplifying assumptions are necessary for any theoretical model in any science. Economists often start with a baseline model that’s as simple as possible, and add frictions as necessary by relaxing restrictive critical assumptions. A critical assumption is one which, when relaxed (made more ""realistic""), changes the conclusion we wish to test in a given context.

&gt;Consider minimum wages in the labor market. Assuming a perfectly competitive market, a price floor like the MW is predicted to lower employment. The perfect competition assumption includes the ""sub-assumption"" that employers have no market power to affect the wage. Relax this assumption (i.e., give employers more bargaining power and call it ""imperfect competition""), and it’s now possible for a moderate MW to actually increase employment. The testable conclusion of the supply and demand model of the labor market has changed once we assume imperfect competition instead of perfect competition. The assumption of no employer market power is thus a critical one when we want to analyze the effects of minimum wages on employment.

&gt;Now consider taxes on cigarettes. It doesn’t matter if we assume perfect or imperfect competition in the cigarette market; a tax on cigarettes is unambiguously predicted to raise price. In this case, perfect competition is not a critical assumption, as relaxing it wouldn’t alter the conclusion we want to test in this scenario.

&gt;This reasoning applies in natural sciences, as well. Quote:

&gt;&gt;If the goal is to put a satellite into orbit, the equations that define Newton's laws of motion and gravity, though not 100% correct, are more than sufficient; you don't need Einstein's theories of relativity though they would provide a more accurate description. But if the goal is to determine a GPS device's location on earth you do need relativity. [...] So there is this art in modeling, this choosing of some aspects and ignoring others, trying to create the the right approximations. **As [famous statistician George Box] notes: ""there is no need to ask the question 'Is the model true?'. If 'truth' is to be the 'whole truth' the answer must be 'No'. The only question of interest is 'Is the model illuminating and useful?'""**"
Confessions of a Hectomillionaire. Part 2: Investment and Portfolio Management,"&gt;I did give a big bank a pool of money out of the 5M to manage to try itout. ... That year the stock market went up for at least 20% but the portfolio big bank managed for me returned a whopping 0.5%.

I gave Chase $3m and told my new friend that he had to beat VTI for me to give them more money.  He matched VTI almost perfectly, but the transaction fees were absurd.  They then waived the fees and asked for a second year, which I gave them because he was my ""friend.""  They beat VTI by 3% that year, but called me at least once a month with updates and to ask for permission to do stuff, which was incredibly annoying.  Year three they lost to VTI by 9% and I dropped the account to 500k with a promise to come back if they did something amazing.  The fees went up because of my capital withdrawal and I really need to just close them out and take my money back."

So you were doing something right, its possible you just didn't adapt to a change in market sentiment. 

I understand the emotions you are feeling. I really do. 

When you feel ready, maybe in some years if that's how long you need, personally I would re approach this whole situation from an analytical perspective, and try to lock down exactly what went wrong. 

Figure out some hard rules to prevent it from happening again, and then start trading small lots to test a new strategy, or a refined one, as a renewed, wiser, and battle-tested trader. 

Give it time, with time it'll sting less and you'll have perspective, being removed from the immediate-ness. 

And maybe keep an open mind in regards to trading in the future, not to recover your losses, but because its something you enjoy and have a passion for."

"If higher interest rates cause house prices to drop, what stops corporations and rich investors from snatching them all up?","You are missing something. It’s called opportunity cost. The fact that a corporation or (even the taxi driver who has worked his butt off for years to save some money so he can invest and make a better life for his kids)has enough cash to buy a house without a mortgage doesn’t mean there is no cost. That taxi driver or corporation has other alternative investments for this cash. They could buy stocks, bonds, nft’s, or collectable spoons with that money. So the cost of that money is the return he will not get from that other alternative. As interest rates rise other similar interest bearing (that is, lower risk) assets see their rates of return ties accordingly. Suddenly things like bonds start to give better returns. Not as good as real estate perhaps, but much lower risk and more liquid. So those other opportunities compete for that taxi driver’s attention. There is no rule or law stopping corps or taxi drivers from buying houses, but other assets become more attractive as interest rates rise and some of the money goes into these other assets."
Anyone scared of this economy?,"As long as interest rates are at these ultra-low levels, people do not have a choice other than to invest in equities, gold, cryptocurrencies &amp;  bonds. The choices of investors could change from one sector to the other. At the moment, it is tech. This could shift to banks, airlines, psychedelics and some of the other sectors as &amp; when they are favored.

You're right when you say companies are valued at insane multiples and countries overloaded with debt, but it's only going to get worse and there's no solution. Any form of a major correction could be considered a buying opportunity, so keep doing your research and invest in the markets. This is the only way to earn money for the foreseeable future. The days of storing cash in almost risk-free bank deposits are gone."
"If 44M Americans have filed for Unemployment in the last 12 weeks, why isn't the unemployment rate 33.7%?","I believe the huffington article is discussing how many people applied for unemployment insurance (UI), which is not entirely related to unemployment rates. UI is calculated by state department of labors whereas the bureau of labor statistics calculates unemployment rates based on survey analysis. 

If they are talking about BLS calculated unemployment rate numbers, that could potentially be because a few populations are not included there, including agricultural workers, business owners, part time workers, and gig economy workers. Also, the unemployment rate is not calculated as the number of unemployed/number of employed. It’s the number of unemployed divided by the size of the workforce, which also includes those who are actively seeking jobs. Hope that helps"

Boris Johnson outlines health and social care tax to pay for reforms,"Here's my issue with it... The generation that now need social care had:  


* Gold plated pensions.  

* Triple lock state pensions.  

* Cheap house prices.

Guess who is paying for all of those already? People not retired who are also unlikely to benefit from any of those. The defined benefit pension schemes have largely been scrapped but are hugely underfunded. The scale of the payments some companies have to make each year to fund now closed schemes are incredible and are payments that could be pumped back into the companies or extracted via corporation tax.  
  
So great... after stumping up a huge multiple of earnings to buy a small house I now have to stump up a material amount of money each month to fund social care? I totally understand there are pensioners who don't have savings and rely on state pension but their generation left us with a huge bomb of deficit that we now have to fund and it doesn't feel fair or just."

"How billionaires get money from the population, but the population is not as wealthy as the billionaires themselves?","*Wealth is not money*.

Let's say you bought a muscle car back in the day. Like a 1971 Plymouth Barracuda for example. Back then, it cost about $5000. Nowadays, they sell for several million dollars. So if you bought one for the original price and kept it all those years, that $5000 purchase now brings your net worth up to the millions. Without any money ever changing hands besides the original transaction.

Same goes for companies like Amazon. You create such a company, you own it. And the value of that company goes up and up. That doesn't mean you sell the company, it doesn't even necessarily mean that any money changes hands. It just means that the *value* goes up."

Would the price of consumer goods decrease when inflation gets under control? Or will prices just not increase as fast?,"Inflation is the rate of increase in the aggregate price level. If the yearly inflation rate is x%, it means that consumer prices are on average x% higher than a year ago. In other words, if a consumer price index had the value 100 last year, with 10% inflation it would be 110 this year. If inflation rate dropped to 3%, it would become 110*(1+3%)=113.3 next year. So, low inflation does not mean lower prices, it means slower price increase on average."

"Factually, did the Obama Administration or the Trump Administration have a greater impact on how well the economy is doing right now?","There's no 'factual' way to produce a number that says exactly how good each President did on the economy.  Unfortunately that's such a gigantic question and the economy has such an enormous number of moving parts, it's basically impossible to give an unbiased answer.

Here are a few things I can say:

* In general, Presidents get too much credit for good economies and too much blame for bad economies.  The president often doesn't have as much control over how the economy is doing as you'd think.
* Obama's most important issue was responding to the financial crisis he inherited.  Obama's response is *generally* considered pretty good by economists.  There are still many who would criticize him - and the strongest criticisms are that he should have gone even further in his actions to stimulate the economy - but it's not clear how politically possible that was.
* Trump inherited a fairly strong economy and it's mostly remained strong while he's been in office.  On his signature issues, trade and immigration, economists are in strong disagreement with his protectionist and isolationist stances.  Economists tend to view free trade and increased immigration as very good for the economy.

"Can someone explain what actually happened in this widely shared video - ""Fraud by ICICI Group Family lost their INR 80 Lac"". Is this simply a case of not reading the documents properly?","*Fun story:*

I faced a similar issue with ICICI. Out of the blue, one day someone calls me identifying himself as an RM assigned to me and wishing to talk about investments (investments for them is always ulips). I quickly cut the call giving them the usual bs. A few days later I get a msg stating that a credit card has been issued in my name. 

I rushed to the home branch looking for answers as Iam someone who abhors credit cards&amp; don't ever intend to use them. The RM's at the bank gave me the usual run around asking me to call customer care and get it sorted. So I decided to give it back to them. I quickly drafted a written complaint describing the issue in great detail while implying identity theft and possible banking fraud. I submit the said letter to the branch manager after clicking a pic.

Later in the day I found out the cluster head's email Id &amp; sent him a copy of the letter stating that if I don't get an answer I would be filing a complaint with the banking ombudsman. Next evening the br manager calls me saying that an RM from their thane branch goofed up and the card was accidentally sent (prob is, I have never lived in thane nor do I have any banking relationship there). So I get the name of the RM and then filed a written complaint against him at the beach and with the cluster head.

ALWAYS scare the living shit out of them if they play with your account. Threatening to move/ close the account doesn't have much impact on them. A complaint with the banking ombudsman however scares the shot out of them as it's their neck on the line."

Common personal finance mistakes,"Honest question: If the amount is large enough, wouldn't you earn more money over the course of a 12 month no cost EMI by parking the funds in a FD? Assuming you also have extra cash to pay off the EMIs while you wait for the FD to mature."
Is profit in real estate mostly property value appreciation or rent?,"There are four benefits to owning rental real estate: cash flow, appreciation, amortization and tax benefits.

Cash flow is the monthly income you're generating, which, these days, is likely to be somewhere between 4% and 10% of your investment per year.

Appreciation is two things... Forced appreciation is the value you add through renovations, over and above the cost of the renovations. Natural appreciation is property values increasing over time due to inflation and market forces.

Personally, I don't like to factor in natural appreciation to my returns, as historically, natural appreciation in many areas has tracked inflation. But the other thing that tracks inflation is expenses, so you don't get the full benefit of natural appreciation because it's offset by inflation in expenses.  If you get lucky, you may make a lot of money through value inflation, but that has been a more recent phenomena and there's no way to know if that trend will continue or not.

That said, forced appreciation is probably one of the fastest ways to build equity, and while it takes some effort, is the reason that I prefer to buy properties that are distressed and have room for value add through renovation.

Amortization is just a fancy word for paying down the principal every month through your regular mortgage payments. These days, this is probably the best way to make money from your properties. With interest rates so low, and loan terms so good, I'm seeing between 5% and 15% equity build up per year on my investment through principal pay down.  Even if you ignore the other benefits of owning real estate, the amortization itself beats the stock market for me.

The other benefit of amortization and loans, in general, is that we are likely to see inflation over the next several years or decades. This means that you will be paying back your loans in inflated dollars, thus creating an arbitrage opportunity that costs you absolutely nothing.

The tax benefits are the final upside of owning rental real estate.  Depreciation allows you to get a tax benefit in each year that you hold the property, oftentimes outweighing much or all of the income you generate, meaning that the government is essentially allowing you to use your rental income as a tax-free loan for as long as you hold the property.

Which of those benefits will be the greatest for you is going to depend on a lot of things, including where you buy, the types of houses you buy, the price point, the amount of renovation needed, your personal tax situation, your ability to get good loans, and how much work you're willing to put into sourcing properties. But, between those four benefits, it's not difficult to achieve 20% or more returns these days with real estate, especially if you're willing to be a little bit hands-on."
"For people with $100M+ NW, how do you manage your money and life?","I almost entered the club earlier this year, probably break the barrier by next year. I'll answer anyway, since I don't think there are many of us near these levels.

Financially, I'm pretty much all self-managed between public markets (sub 1% in ETFs, writing options these days, but the lions share in shares), crypto (mostly just direct), and private investments (agree it's a great way to stay connected to tech). I also probably spend too much time on investing, but I have fun (?) with it I guess.

I have a couple mil in real estate, pretty minimal for my NW IMO. I have a plan to acquire a bunch, just haven't executed it - maybe it'll appeal more next year if I settle down. I just prefer low leverage, having margin liquidity for moves, and don't really want to sell anything if I can avoid it. 

I don't really use financial advisors either. I would if I could find someone I trusted and thought could do a decent job. I also have accountants, tax drama, and bank accounts in multiple countries - a total pita I'd love to never think about. 

As far as life, I just travel non-stop. Been at it for 15 years or so, at first I was mostly a road warrior (work) and just slowly migrated to 100% play. I have a gf that travels with me. We're both minimalists. I don't think anyone would suspect my wealth if they met me, unless they know watches or jumped to a conclusion based on a hotel stay. I'm thinking about settling down more and maybe having kids, but I'd definitely hire a PA, nanny, etc if I did that. If I can come to terms with settling down.

Being a nomadic minimalist with silly levels of means makes for a weird life experience. I'm just spending the real scarce asset (time) how I want.."
It still shocks me how many people still don’t understand the marginal tax system,You're only taxed on the amount over the bracket right? So say the highest bracket is 45% &gt;=180k and you earn 182k. Only 2k would be taxed at 45%. The rest would be the lower brackets. That's how I assume it works anyway

"Marrying into a 10 digit family, prenup advice","The other comments have covered a lot of the nuts-and-bolts aspects of how to handle this, but I'd advise zooming out a bit and thinking about what you're both looking to get out of this, and discuss that with your fiancé.

Personally, what I'd be looking for in this situation is equal footing in the marriage: neither of you wants to feel like you're mooching off the other, and neither of you wants to feel like you're dragging the other down. And the reality of your fiancé's situation is that, regardless of the specific sum the trust pays him, he has a lot of opportunity to do interesting things in life that are pretty different from your tech grind.

Which means that, a few years from now, he'd probably prefer it if you spent less time on the tech grind, so you had more time to spend on travel/family/philanthropy/""meaningful work""/etc. But that entails reducing not only your current income, but also your future income/career prospects/etc. And as long as you feel like you need to hang on to your career for the sake of your own personal financial security, that's going to be a source of conflict (maybe internal conflict within yourself, maybe external conflict between the two of you).

So that's the first conversation to have. ""How can we frame this prenup so our interests are aligned?"" Probably something along the lines of providing you an income equivalent to what you'd be making in a tech career, phasing in over time. Ground it in reality: if you step away from tech for a year or two, that has implications that are much different than leaving tech for a decade.

Once you've got alignment on the ""I want to make sure I'm covered so I'm not holding you back"" part, then it's time to move on to the ""how do we make this a real partnership"" part of the discussion. The day after you get married, you're not going to be financial peers, but ten or twenty years down the line your marriage is going to be stronger if you're on equal footing. Figure out what you want that to look like. From your post, it's not really clear whether he expects to get single-digit-millions-plus-a-stipend or the whole billion-dollar fortune or something in between, but if it's closer to the former, then your present financial situations really aren't so different from each other, and you really can get on something resembling equal footing after a few years. If he's got a substantial inheritance coming his way, though, then he should spend some time thinking about his relationship with money.

And there's really no right answer on that last part. The ""protect the fortune vs have a marriage of equals"" debate is similar to the ""move to a tax haven"" debate. Personally, I'm in the ""what's the point of having money if it limits what you can do?"" camp, so if I were in his shoes I'd probably be on the ""be equals"" side of things (with some kind of phase-in), but every relationship is different.

Once you've got those big-picture things worked out, draw up an informal ""this is what we want the prenup to achieve"" document, hand it off to the lawyers, and they can fill in the details."

What do you think about the evidence supporting that 88% of the COVID19 economic downturn was due to voluntary decisions and not lockdown rules?,"u/flavorless_beef you are quite correct in your estimation regarding the fundamental soundness of the study itself. There are also no econometric or strict statistical grounds which appear to suggest that the analysis should be disregarded or significantly attenuated from that perspective. 

The only real ""shortcoming"" of the study with regard to inferences that can be drawn from the data, is the time at which it took place. The data were primarily gathered at a relatively early stage of the outbreak when very little was known about the virus itself nor how long its economic effects would persist. It is doubtful that these figures would still hold true today, when many are sceptical of the severity (or in some cases even the existence of) the virus. Ironically, this would weaken the case for the initial lockdown, but strengthen the argument  mitigatory effect it could have now.

One certainly cannot view the reallocation of capital towards ""essential"" goods and away from ""non-essential"" as being economically beneficial - not least because these categories are somewhat arbitrary from the outset. At best it may be regarded as neutral. The effect on aggregate output and demand, however, is (in the short-run at least) certainly negative. The caveat being that if it contributes to a quicker sense of security and safety for the populace to ""return to normal"" then it would be very beneficial. It may be an open question as whether this has been achieved.

Finally, if economic impact could be viewed as a negative corollary of mitigation of the virus (which appears to be the implication) then it would follow that lockdowns were - at the margin - not that detrimental to the economy as would otherwise have been the case, but also not that effective - at the margin - at mitigating the spread of the virus because the overwhelming majority of the effect in fact was voluntarily achieved. Likewise, if we are now in a period at which lockdowns are relatively more important to mitigate then their relative impact on the economy would also rise. Therefore, lockdowns are either mostly harmless and mostly ineffective, or at times when their effectiveness is bolstered by a lack of voluntary mitigation they are more effective and more harmful to the economy. Which is merely a very long-winded way of saying that in lockdowns, as in most things, there are trade-offs."

Full quote, which is much more wordy then the previous mentions they made:  


&gt;Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment."

"Americans, What did you do with your bachelor degree in economics?","Not a BA in econ, but I have had a few work with me over the years. 
In no particular order

1) Economics dpt at bank

2) Country risk (basically economics) for a credit agency

3) financial analyst roles (credit or equity research/risk)

3) FP&amp;A for multinationals

4) still doing econ PhD (it takes sooo long lol)

What percentage of your portfolio is crypto,"Essentially 0%.

I don't see it as an investment, since it's a non-productive asset.

I do try to keep up with it, as some of the tech is interesting (on a theoretical level). It might have a few non-niche applications in the future, but whether you can rip those benefits from the buying a token, or investing in the companies who actually provide a service related with crypto, is not clear to me.

Also, every time I go into a crypto forum, it's obvious that most people are just parroting marketing points, buzzwords, or memes, and few actually understand the technical details of it (while claiming that everyone else doesn't understand the tech). I'm willing to bet that half the people in crypto don't even know how a hash works.

These are all red flags for me."
The 800k tax situation,"I don’t know the article but I think there’s more going on and you actually don’t understand the rule. The rule disallows a loss IF you buy the same (or substantially similar) investment within 30 days. What a lot of people misunderstand is that the loss is only disallowed from the first sale but it’s added to the basis of your new investment so it will/can be realized later when you sell the next time around. 

Look at it this way. On day 1, you buy ABC for $100. You then sell it on day 2 for $80. That’s a $20 loss. However, if you then turn around and buy ABC on day 3 for $90, that loss is disallowed and it’s instead added to the basis of your new investment which makes it $110. Now, if you sell ABC on day 4 for $110, you’d think you’d have a $20 gain (since you bought it for $90) but since you’re now selling the stock, you’re able to realize the disallowed loss indirectly through the increased cost basis and your net profit on the sale is zero. It actually works out the same way as if you just had the $20 loss and the $20 gain.

EDIT: Just editing to add that this only becomes a problem when you’re holding multiple positions at year end. If you close out of everything every day (which is the definition of day trading ...) this cannot be an issue."

What is the likelihood of an economic depression happening in our lifetimes?,"Pretty low. The fact is, a depression stems from a recession that lasts. 
For a depression to happen, it basically entails that either the fiscal side or the monetary or both of those side aren't doing what is necessary to fight the recession which leads to a spiral.

A recession becomes a depression when businesses go under, unemployment rise, households are reluctant to spending which leads to even more businesses going under and it then impact the financial system as people and companies aren't able to repay their loans.

Fiscal and monetary can fight that, the fiscal side can compensate for the lack of demand during the recession and support distressed companies, avoiding a widespread wave of bankruptcies. 

Monetary stimulus can help by acting as a lender of last resort providing liquidity to whoever needs it, households don't need to be scared about a bank going under and doing a run on it (bank runs are a pure disaster for an economy). They can also reduce the interest rates making loan to distressed companies more affordable.

If you look at what happened during the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve messed up. Instead of increasing the money supply, it actually steadily decreased during the whole duration of the Great Depression.

In large part because of bank runs : depositors lost money (which meant lower spending from them) but it also meant less lending to an already distressed economy. If the Federal Reserve had acted appropriately by providing liquidity to the banks who needed it, the depression probably wouldn't never have happened. Depositors would have never lost money which means more spending and less bankruptcies, and banks could have kept lending flowing to companies.

This why economists typically say that it's better to provide too much than not providing enough. Overshoot, great you can scale back. Undershoot ? It's going to be painful, by the time you act the damage is already done."

Do illegal immigrants take more from a country than they contribute?,"Short answer: No.

Long Answer: Undocumented Immigrants *contribute* more than they take in terms of nearly everything pertaining to how and where they work. 

Undocumented Immigrants contribute [$12B](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/ITEP-2017-Undocumented-Immigrants-State-and-Local-Contributions.pdf) in taxes. That they can actually pay. This figure would go up if they were given a pathway to citizenship. 

First generation undocumented immigrants work jobs most Americans won't. Most Americans are not willing to do crop work. [California Farms tried raising wages and still cannot convince Americans to do hard manual labor for 8 hours a day](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/)

Second Generation undocumented Immigrants, IE Kids that would be considered ""Dreamers"" or DACA kids, take part in society via the education system. They're not ""taking"" educations. They earn one, can go off to school, and then contribute in the different ways every other person that goes off to school contributes to our society. 

This [conservative](https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/report-illegal-immigration-costs-taxpayers-116-billion-annually-californians-texans-floridians-pay-the-most/article_f942e522-c5b0-11e9-93e6-0ff213e44ae5.html) site claims Undocumented Immigrants cost the US $116B. This is completely ignoring that Agriculture in the US is a [1 Trillion Dollar](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/) part of our economy. If there are not people willing to work in the farms, none of those crops are getting harvested. 

Because of a lack of undocumented immigrants that are already in the US farmers have to apply for guest worker visas because migrant workers are [integral to the farm system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/with-fewer-undocumented-workers-to-hire-us-farmers-are-fueling-a-surge-in-the-number-of-legal-guest-workers/2019/02/21/2b066876-1e5f-11e9-a759-2b8541bbbe20_story.html)


When people come to this country no matter how they get here they are coming for an opportunity. The people that come here are smart, hard working, and they want to be apart of the country and contribute to the goals of the country.

So through a pure cost benefit analysis, we literally cannot harvest crops without them. [Americans won't do it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/15/north-carolina-needed-6500-farm-workers-only-7-americans-stuck-it-out/). They've tried many many times.

If BABA was an American company I firmly believe it would be trading for over $800/share right now.,"There have been quite a few missives on BABA on this sub with some good analysis so may want to hunt/read those. 

I think you’re missing that BABA is facing a lot of pressure from Meituan, Pinduoduo, and JD; much more than they historically faced and are putting much more CapEx now into keeping up. It would be like if Facebook bought Shopify/FedEx and was competing with Amazon, Walmart had a group buying initiative and was making major inroads against Amazon, and people actually bought goods off of a combined Uber/Lyft that were making inroads against Amazon. Meanwhile the government just made Bezos disappear. Would likely not be a $800 stock in the US. You need a dominant market position (eg an unregulated monopoly) to earn that, I don’t know if BABA is quite there.

Not a great example and I know the Chinese business models are very different….but you should get the picture. 

BABA is one of my largest holdings but I’m under no impression that this is a “sure thing” investment."
If BABA was an American company I firmly believe it would be trading for over $800/share right now.,"I don't know where I stand on BABA.

On one hand, literally everyone is talking about it and saying it is undervalued - if that's the case, it usually isn't (I know I know, you aren't right whether 1000 people agree or disagree with you, I'm breaking a value investing principle). When you invest in CCP companies you own ADSs which aren't actual shares thus no voting rights, very hard to get dividends, possible lies on financial statements, you name it.

On the other, Munger has openly invested in it alongside some other value investing stalwarts. Munger alone is a testament to it being undervalued."

What will globalisation look like when wages are too high and comparative advantage is lost?,"I think you're misunderstanding comparative advantage.

Comparative advantage is like this: Consider two countries that both make wine and cloth. Country A can make *both* wine and cloth more efficiently and more profitably than Country B. But Country A makes wine *much* better than Country B does while making cloth only a little better. So wine is just way more profitable for Country A than cloth is. In that case, Country A is better off buying cloth from Country B even though it's more expensive than making cloth themselves because overall, it's better to focus production on making and selling wine.

For Country A, switching production from wine to cloth would cost more than the cost difference between producing cloth and buying cloth. So even though Country B doesn't have any products that it makes better than Country A, it has a *comparative advantage* in producing cloth because it has a lower opportunity cost for not producing wine."
When asked for salary expectations Do Not Give A Number,"I mean it’s fine to give a number if you understand your worth and how much the job should pay.

Is there a conflict of interest between personal finance and the economy?,"I like the other comments here, and for once, I'll try to keep my addition focussed to the examples and mention another example, instead of going into the more broad ideas. In general, I’d note that, because most of these also either result in more consumption now or later, it is generally a matter of time preferences. Instead, your point will generally only hold if wealth-moving services/goods conflict with more productive services/goods.


Debunks:


* Not spending can be bad for future consumption, but people tend to forget that saving  results in investment (if you deposit money, it is usually borrowed by someone else). In the [Solow]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model) there is a golden-rule Savings rate, and while we do not empirically know the rate, the last time I had courses in traditional growth theory we were usually assumed to save too little. Now, short-run spending can bridge the output gap and thus can cause growth – my point is just that it is not as black and white as people think. The most important point is that it would still be up to personal preference (discount rate) what you would prefer – long-term higher growth or current-term more consumption. So even if it negatively affects growth, we can’t say that that causes suboptimal utility. 


* In the case of investing ‘too much’ (resulting in high PE ratios, causing a ‘bubble’) – this is similarly only problematic if we see a shift afterwards. If the P/E ratios go up for all companies alike, this simply suggests that we are valuing future profit (and thus future income) much more than current (you can see how this is linked to the other point). Only if we assume that later on, suddenly people will stop caring about this, this is a bubble.


* Your example for kids is only relevant if you consider the economy as a whole – if you would think of GDP per capita, it may not be bad at all.


Example where it holds:


* There is evidence ([1]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12385?casa_token=l7WtgKLRQv4AAAAA%3A_dsD8jgq5BC4iyUL9DCe7-idZYiMUqwkO6K3rU5a29idht5WxqqBu81vk0bI6fdPseYFJuaRXDmAn_LG), [2]( https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.2.3.158)) which suggests that a significantly large financial system harms economic growth by competing with other sectors (e.g. tech) for talent. The reasoning is simple; imagine that a person, when working for Google, could create a product which would make Google 100$M in profit, and create 100$M consumer surplus. That person could, similarly, start working for a financial institution, at which he/she causes 200$M in profit. This could however come from a (near) zero-sum game, at which point we are (largely) moving wealth, not creating it. Still, as the additional profit is higher, the firm could very well compete for this talent."
SEBI shows fangs - Kishore Biyani banned from markets for 1 year,"Linked article says ""  Future Corporate Resources had traded in the shares of FRL ... made notional unlawful gains of ₹17.78 crore ""And SEBI fines them 1 Cr each ( 2 Crore between the 2 brothers)

Edit:

* Glad to know the gains also are recovered by SEBI (Didn't know that's always the case).

* Hoping and assuming they also levy interest penalty on the gain and would personally prefer if they recovered Actual gains rather than Notional"
"When critical infrastructure (Water, electricity, etc) is privatized, the complaint is often that the profits have been privatized and the losses have been socialized. Is this a fair criticism?","Privatisations almost always come with heavy performance commitments. In practice, this means rather than decreasing maintenance, they often have to commit to increasing maintenance or otherwise investing in infrastructure. 

In general, long dated assets like infrastructure are funded by cash flows very far in the future. Private companies often have the ability to withstand upfront losses for the promise of future cash flow; but governments are actually really bad at that. This is primarily because government budgets for infrastructure tend to be political decisions for the Budget, which means they are decided by the exigencies of that particular year.

Mechanisms also exist to prevent infrastructure companies from profiting too much during privatisations. These are generally called Regulated Asset Base models. In general, they sort of guarantee x% return to the company, but also fixes the pricing they're allowed to charge as a percentage of the investments they put in.

Edit since it's a hot topic in the comments:

Yes - in practice enforcement is not always easy, and in many cases the multiple mechanisms are not applied at the same time or in sufficient size. In countries with endemic corruption, the entire infrastructure platform is effectively given away for free to politically connected people, the post-Soviet world being a very prime example. While in countries like the US where lobbying is fervent and restricting profits is politically taboo, the terms are either not well enforced or just weak.

In some cases, the enforcement is overzealous or otherwise prohibitive. UK energy pricing rules required strict price limits and limited profitability, this forced energy providers to cut costs aggressively particularly by reducing their electricity price hedges. When energy prices spiked, those companies were unprotected and also unable to raise prices, eventually bankrupting half of them and requiring various government interventions. In Germany, so much emphasis is placed on ensuring that small rural communities have internet access even at ridiculous costs that everywhere else is underinvested and Germany of all countries has the worst telecom infrastructure in Europe.

Executing any economic policy, especially one as comprehensive and complex as a nationalisation / privatisation is never going to be simple or perfect. Economics provides us with tools, theories, and mechanisms, but humans and institutions ultimately have to execute."

Can anyone please explain why WFH jobs won’t just get offshored?,"Currently working on a project which has hybrid teams both here and overseas.

This has been my experience with every single offshore team.

If their code were to go live it would be a disaster. Combine this with being overseas and the regulations &amp; security concerns means it's not viable.

This is why there will always be more developers here. From my experience the vast majority of companies end up bringing these workers back onshore when they realise what a nightmare it is."

This is my boring advice. 

First- education, college and upskilling - atleast upto age 30 if not lifelong. Best roi of money ever. 

Now

Keep it simple 

2 bank accounts - one for spending and one for investment 

1 credit card - always pay on time, this is for credit rating 

1 dmat account 

1 mutual fund app

60 percent of your funds in index funds and DIRECT mutual funds

20 percent in PPF, FD or debt funds

20 percent in direct stocks - for learning, not for profits per say

No day trading - EVER

No MLM or schemes that your friends get, only invest in the above three

Buy one house if you don't own a house in the city you plan to live at the age of 45 in 

Invest in learning more to earn more - maximum ROI is in earning more money

Invest in nifty 50 and other index funds, they are better than mutual funds these days

No insurance policy which give you money back, Life insurance is for those who have a dependant like kids or non earning wife and non earning parents

Sorry for a super boring plan, this will make you rich Complicated plans will keep you busy, keep you excited but not make you money, they will make the brokers and the companies money

74yo and almost broke.,"My mother-in-law never saved a dime. After her husband passed, she lived with her children for a while, but then she had a stroke and had to end up living in a nursing home.

Is Retiring From Dividend Truly Realistic or a Myth?,"So I'm going to give you a bit life advice that I hope you really take to heart.  I hate working.  I'm also lazy, but I'm smart.  Now if you can take a step back and look at the big picture here, you'll probably come to the same realization I did.  If you do something the most intelligent way possible, it's less work trying to redo it over again because you screwed up, or you did something else instead because you were lazy.  Work hard, harder than everyone else, but be smart about it.  You can work your ass off for minimum wage and not get anywhere.  You can be a genius and work until you die.  The person with the easiest life is the one who uses his smarts to be lazy in an environment where everyone thinks you're stupid.  In my day job, I get paid 35/hr to watch youtube and read subreddits because I learned how to automate my job.  I do all my learning at work, and make real money outside of work, using what I research, plan etc.

Anyways.  Stay in school, get a trade, a degree, anything that makes you valuable.  Live like you're poor, get paid like you're rich.  Invest everything you don't need.  Then at some point, maybe when you're 30, maybe when you're 50, but at some point you will be retired living off your investments while everyone else is still working...but it all depends what you do starting now.

You can very much live off of dividends, but don't waste your time buying yield traps, or chasing hype.  Be smart about your investing.  Find good companies on good discounts and let them pay for your future.

"Are most modern economic theories right-wing? If yes, then why is that?","Economics as an academic discipline neither leans left nor right. 

We try to make descriptive statements of the sort: “this policy will affect this outcome in this way”, and welfare statements of the sort “this policy would make make the average person better off”. 

We try to reach this conclusions using data and being agnostic about political preferences. 

Economists have developed tools that could be used by both right wing and left wing politicians. For example, macroeconomists have developed models to help central banks make monetary decisions that help the economy grow. They have also developed models on the optimal way to tax capital and redistribute wealth. 

In my experience, anyone who self-identifies as a right-wing economist or a left-wing economist is more of a sociologist or political scientist (and usually not a very good one).

Some famous economists with left-wing ideas include: Thomas Piketty and Nobel Laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz. Piketty became famous after he wrote a book called Capital in the XXIst century that documents the large increase of income and wealth inequality in the West during the last few decades. Krugman advocates for left-wing ideas on social media, but his research was mostly apolitical."

If you want to make money from what you've built rather than stoking your own speculation, use it live and run it for a decently long period. Then if you have **actual results** form a company and grant it the intellectual property after which you sell the company. The price would be decided by the offers you receive.

Did I Get Scammed In Mexico?,"I'm a real estate agent here in Puerto Vallarta. I can answer a few of your questions.

10% down is standard practice here.

Funding escrow with the 90% remainder of the purchase price, plus closing costs, 3-5 days before closing is standard as the property cannot be transferred unless escrow is funded.
Funds from escrow cannot be disbursed without the signature of both parties, buyer and seller, so even though the threat of penalty is there, it's difficult to enforce. And a property can't be sold if you have a vested interest in it (money in escrow, under contract) so they can't put it back on the market unless you sign off on it. Usually the buyer and seller will come to a quick compromise and move on.

Read your contract.
Did you sign an addendum that the repairs must be completed before closing? if not you don't have much recourse. I always use a clause that if during walk through 3 days before closing repairs haven’t been done, and the buyer and seller can't come to an agreement, thats reason to terminate the contract without penalty. 

I don't think you're getting scammed. It just sounds like you may have an inexperienced/crappy agent (always use a reputable agency and an AMPI certified agent when doing real estate transactions in Mexico) who should be able to advise you as opposed to a random stranger on the internet. If you are unsure, call the broker, move up the chain of command. Squeaky wheel and all that.

Edit.
I saw that below you said the repairs were written into the contract. In that case the seller is in breach of contract and must remedy the problem or face a penalty. Your agent is dropping the ball."

I firmly believe that the trend of human history points upward even if it goes through dips and valleys to get there.

Equity share has the potential for more upside but could also result in lower returns, and comes with risk."
What would be the implications economically if we put a cap on how much corporations can buy up single family houses and properties?,"TLDR;

* overall, hard to say as it depends a lot on what the specifics are, but I would bet that hard caps on relatively low levels of ownership are net negatives.
* effects of corporate onwership on housing markets aren't super well understood and I don't feel confident making exact predictions. In general the limited research seems to say corporate owners tend to be ""worse"" landlords, [possibly have positive impacts neighborhoods, and have some positive upward pressure on prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410281) (either through monopoly power, [the ability to buy distressed assets in bulk, or the ability to provide floors for prices during downturns](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2019/wp19-45.pdf)).
* what effects there are will vary a lot by geography

&amp;#x200B;

In full, it's again hard to say without specifics about the proposal. I'm assuming that when you mean ""cap on number of properties"" you're including both single-family homes, apartments, and condos in your proposal. I'm also going to intentionally say ""cap on number of properties"" and ""large tax on ownership that increases with number of properties"" are similar enough to be treated the same.

Anyways, first, whenever you hear ""X percent of homes last year/month/whatever were bought by corporate landlords"" what that means is that in the last time period, X percent of the names on the deeds contained words like ""LLC"", ""LLP"", ""Corporate"", etc. That'll capture the Blackstone/Imagine Homes/Zillow/ other big ""institutional"" investors, but it'll also grab any landlord who happens to have incorporated as an LLC. Sometimes that's what people care about, but often they only want the former and not the latter. It's also not clear how universities or non-profits -- which are often some of the largest landowners in a city -- are treated given they'll often have words like ""Corporation"" or ""Trust"" in their name which will get flagged.

Those are all fixable, but there are administrative problems with identifying corporations, which get harder when you try to tie your proposal to the specific number of homes each corporation owns especially since large landlords like Blackstone have huge networks of opaque subsidiaries.

But let's assume you can do a decent job of identifying corporations, and that you somehow can get through whatever layer of shell companies exist so that you somehow know how many properties each one has. It's still not really clear what an optimal cap looks like, if there is one.

First, the negatives against institutional ownership. There's some evidence [that real estate investors drove up prices following the foreclosure crisis in 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1540-6229.12396), but this is a little more nuanced than just investors driving up prices; investors also help stabalize markets by setting something of a floor for property values. It's also a little tough to evaluate the effect of large institutional investors purchasing things since they usually purchase pretty distressed assets in bulk quantities, but it's not clear what would have happened to those asset holders had they not been able to sell. There's also s[ome evidence that institutional investors drive up rent prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410281), but it's a little ambiguous whether this increase is from monopoly power vs changes in ammenities (in particular less crime). Lastly, there's literature on whether big landlords tend to be more exploitative towards tenants and it [Seems like they're worse for tenants](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2893552).

It's kinda unclear though, at what geographic and ownership concentration level these negative effects exist and if they do exist, how big a deal they are -- [the literature on foreign ownership](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixoMyEntT7AhWaRDABHWxoAH0QFnoECBwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeaweb.org%2Fconference%2F2021%2Fpreliminary%2Fpaper%2FsEFGk7nH&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FGq2iulR8OLw0YWY9r85V) (see pages 6-8), which is kind of analogous, is all over the place: in some places it matters, it other places it doesn't, and it isn't clear to me how to tell you which bucket your city falls in. All this matters for picking a policy, and I don't think there's a clearcut answer to what optimal thresholds might exist and what kinds of markets we should be focusing on.

So what's the problem with picking a cap or a tax that's too high? Besides the normal arguments against deadweight loss, that if there's no harm investors should be able to invest, that this is a waste of time and resources etc. the first big one would be that you might kill off investment during a time when most places are already facing housing shortages. This depends on how aggressive your cap/tax on. If it's really aggressive I could see it killing off the ""mega development"" projects that develop thousands of units since those might automatically make a landlord qualify. This could have obvious affordability and local development impacts.

The second big one would be that you would need someone to be able to step in during a downturn -- again, when people talk about places [like Detroit where investors bought large amounts of foreclosed homes](https://www.bridgemi.com/urban-affairs/university-michigan-invested-big-detroit-now-come-evictions), it's not clear to me whether that's a better or worse outcome than what would have happened had you banned them from buying. The usual solution I've seen involves the government stepping in, or offering dilapidated homes to people willing to live in them, but local governments -- in particular Detroit -- often have very limited money and people often don't want to live in dilapidated homes in recession hit cities. So it's not clear to me that the disease is better than the cure.

As a last note, I think in general most places don't have high levels of institutional investment (in the same way that most places don't have lots of AirBnBs or lots of foreign ownership), and so thinking that this will be the silver bullet for high rent prices (as opposed to more supply) is incorrect and potentially a red herring. Most focus should probably be on some combo of increased supply + money for low-income tenants."

What’s going on with ICLN?,"Clean energy is a volatile business that's sensitive to all kinds of unsystematic (idiosyncratic) risk:

* Government policies on things like tax credits, carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, subsidies, etc.
* Supply and demand
* Materials supply chain
* Competition with prices of non-renewables
* Irrational optimism about the future importance of the sector
* Weather (!)

We can speculate about a few reasons for why clean energy stock prices are falling. One is that clean energy companies have not grown as much as expected. Expectations about future growth were priced in; as these companies don't meet analysts' earnings targets, investors pull out, leading to lower share prices that reflect the new expectations.

Another potential problem is that many of these companies are capital-intensive, with large amounts of debt and a reliance on government contracts and subsidies. A renewable energy plant (e.g. waste processing) may take billions of dollars and several years to construct. As interest rates rise, they have a harder time raising new debt. In the US, 10-year rates are up about 60% since January.

You would think that governments' increased focus on clean energy would result in higher share prices for clean energy companies. Lots more demand, right? But that isn't necessarily the case. Higher demand can result in more competition, with more companies competing for the same marketshare, resulting in lower profits overall, and ultimately a saturated market. Just because clean energy is ""hot"" doesn't mean everyone gets rich. Google and Facebook saw huge growth because they can expand to ridiculous scales with relatively low capital investment and minimal customer aquisition costs. Energy companies don't work the same way.

The market can be super hot and yet everyone is trying to capture the same contracts. Of course, not everything is about infrastructure; companies like SunRun and Enphase make electronics that goes into solar installations, a market with different dynamics altogether. It's interesting that US and Chinese solar companies (SunRun, Enphase, SolarEdge, First Solar, etc.) have done much worse recently than European wind power companies (Vestas, Orsted, etc.), for example.

I'm probably missing a bunch of things here (and I'm not an expert by far!), but those are some starting points.

It's worth noting that the energy sector as a whole is way up over 2020, and has been one of the best-performing sectors. VDE is up 41.85% YTD, compared to 11.58% for the S&amp;P 500. Unfortunately, much of the gains are from oil and natural gas. Exxon, Chevron, etc. are way up."

Is poverty largely due to corruption and authoritarianism?,"There is certainly correlation. Corruption and authoritarianism dissuade investment, mismanage resources, and generally damage economies.

However, the debate regarding causality is complex. It is far easier to achieve democracy when you have certain levels of economic success, and economic successes can come from myriad sources (plentiful resources being an obvious benefit). Poverty can also be leverage by authoritarian regimes to maintain personal power; a population looking first of all to personal subsistence struggles to rebel. As such, pre-existing wealth levels greatly influence the likelihood of achieving democracy or escaping authoritarianism. Untying which causes the other, when each reinforces the other, is difficult.

So while these factors entrench poverty where it exists, whether or not it is the 'cause' is best approached, imo, on a case by case basis. You will never be able to tell the whole story of an economy, let alone a whole class of economies, by examining only one factor."

Ie- buying a gilt today releases ~£100 into the economy today but it has a positive yield so it takes those profits out of tomorrow’s economy; the original owner could have been spending the coupon payments whereas the bank will not. 

The central banks are buyers and sellers of last resort, and here they are the buyers of last resort to keep lending cheap. 

The printing money, here, is due to the collaboration with the treasury. BOE print money to buy gilts, the government issue new gilts, and the new money goes directly on furlough. This has some inflationary pressure, but not enough to counter the pandemic. This increases savings/reduces debt of the people in the short term. 

Longer term, if we return to a sense of normal quickly, the additional savings will be spent pretty quickly and lead to inflation at that point. Possibly. 


If the BOE really wanted to print money, they’d be utilising the governments overdraft facility more - this allows new money into the economy with no real reduction in the future money supply. This is still not in use as far as I’m aware."

Why are we letting younger generations to be priced out of the market?,"The young have no power. The ones with power don't really give a shit and when they die their wealth will get transferred to the kids who in turn won't give a shit either.

Are people increasingly worthless?,"No, this is just the [lump of labor fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-of-labour-fallacy.asp). Basically, people add to the supply of labor but they also add to the demand because people don't just work, they also buy stuff. So there's no particular reason to think that an increase in population leads to a decline in living standards, especially if that population growth happens smoothly over time, which it tends to do.

"Burned my account, fully depressed.","I'm 25 and am literally in the exact same situation you're in right now. Nothing really compares to losing a relatively incomprehensible amount of money in such a short time. Many people say it's ""just money"", but for me, and probably for you as well, it's much more when you think of the bills and debt that could have been paid with it.

Learn. You absolutely have to learn, teach yourself relentlessly. I'm tell you, the only way you'll make it back is if you learn how to trade and/or invest. I'm not there yet and haven't made much back but I'm on my way. I've spent the past 2 months dumping ALL of my time into learning technical and fundamental analysis, and I'll be honest, I don't have confidence in my trading yet but the knowledge has given me hope. The hope is the only thing keeping me going. That, and a lot of support from my friends and family. I only tell them what I want them to know (they DON'T know how much I blew lol), but generalize mostly that I'm struggling and it's hard, but that I have a plan. I know it'll take a while to really get good, but after what I've learned, I can see myself being profitable in the future.

You need risk management above all else. Preservation of capital is the only thing that will save you, you're in this game to survive above all else. This includes both stop orders and exposure limitations, as well as diversification of what you're trading. The money will come, but you have to set realistic expectations and understand it may take a few years. Trade small and don't allow yourself to blow up again. 

You need a strategy to tell you what setups to trade. You should use fundamental analysis to establish a bias (long or short). You need technical analysis to understand when to enter and exit a trade. Having a mentor helps, I haven't had much of that aspect yet but I've heard it's essential.

Choosing the right market is also important. I wanted to trade stocks, but having a cash account makes it hard with settlement periods. Having a margin account is great but I can't afford to tie up 25k due to PDT, and to potentially lose it all again if I fuck up. I'm looking into forex right now, because you can still trade price action with any acount size and integrate a little news into your strategies.

DM me if you want a little extra help. I'm struggling myself but I really truly believe it's possible to make that money back and eventually turn this into a career of financial independence based on the idea of being consistently profitable. I found out that for every person who YOLO'd their second mortgage on GME calls, there's a thousand people with loss porn they're too embarrassed to share."
Why isn’t the US federal government investing in infrastructure to try and stimulate the economy like China is?,"Infrastructure is more important in a developing economy because there are more likely to be high return projects that can be done. Building a new bridge is a bigger deal than adding a new lane to an existing bridge.

In the US the lead times due to environmental, legal, and labor regulations are so long that it is hard to be counter cyclical. By the time the paperwork is done and all the lawsuits finished the economic situation has changed and stimulus may not be needed.

The type of people that need help the most are unlikely to be the skilled workers that do infrastructure. So instead of helping poor people who are out of a job because of the pandemic you end up bidding the price of skilled labor higher and substituting public projects for private projects,"
How much Cash you holding right now and what are your current thoughts on the market?,"Outside of a family six month emergency fund I’m basically in 0% cash. You can’t time these things. I got out of VTI in January because I thought the valuations (by CAPE and Buffet ratio) were ridiculous but I haven’t been able to beat that ETF since then in my investments. There are always deals out there, just have to look harder nowadays. Perhaps you avoid the areas you think are frothy (meme stocks, SPACs, crypto, etc)? I pared back some of my US exposure in favor of emerging/developed though I don’t want to get into a “buy this” discussion, just showing there are alternatives out there. My short term track record isn’t great of course anyways."
27M - $45M+ inheritance after tragedy. Advice?,"Fellow inheritor here. First of all, I'm very sorry for your loss. I expect you're going to need a lot of time to process what's happened - even more time than you've already given yourself. That's okay. Managing this kind of wealth is a marathon and not a spring.

Part of my inheritance included control of a sizeable ($10M+) donor advised fund, and I can say that administering that fund has been one of the most worthwhile things I've ever done. I'm able to consider a range of projects and to grant in small amounts of $10K - $50K, and to track the projects as they come to fruition. (This is all done somewhat anonymously, and thus far we haven't had any issues with unsolicited requests.)

Some of the organizations I've worked with have been able to succeed where much larger, better funded organizations have failed. That's a good feeling.

So please don't feel as though you need to undertake a full, separate career in order to make a difference. Successfully managing a large windfall \*is\* work - particularly if you use a portion of it to help others. Also, most people who inherit that kind of money are unfortunately not able to sustain it in the long run - certainly not to the point where they transition it to further generations.

You may well decide you want to go back to school to study something that will help make the world a better place - perhaps international development or non-profit management - but you do not need to take paid employment to put those skills to use. Similarly, you may decide that you \*do\* want to find a job to add structure and purpose to your day. I do a bit of light consulting both because I enjoy it, and so that I can return to work if it's ever necessary. Writing and reading widely are also both great hobbies.

I know you've taken some time to grieve and to process all of this, but I would say that there is still no rush. ""Hasten slowly,"" as wealth advisor James Hughes likes to say.

In terms of recommended reading, I'd suggest Strangers in Paradise by James Grubman and The Voice of the Rising Generation and Complete Family Wealth, both of which are by James Hughes. And please feel free to send me a PM if you ever want to talk."

"After 1+ years of trading, this is the strategy I've learned to trust. Advice for any new traders","Your strategy ticks most of the points on my list as well. All very sound.

I have additionally:

- Never buy into something that just went up 3x or more. FOMO is the worst, it will kill the value of your portfolio for months or years. Of course it has happened to me - and I am thankful that most of those coins have come back at some point. BUT the cost of having underwater positions is real: selling at a loss hurts and I have to find money elsewhere if I want to buy something. ""you aren't at a loss if you don't sell"" is only half true.

- Try to identify the big trends. Last year, that was ERC-20 tokens, masternodes and ICO's. This year, it's going to be NEO tokens, masternodes, privacy coins and exchange tokens. Buying into those trends early can make you outsized profits (up to 50x on some ICO's from last year)."

Mid-Career Reflections,"Totally agree on this. Spent the early part of my career climbing the consulting corporate ladder.

I often get asked by fresh graduates and those early in their career: ""How can I get to xx level of salary increment."" where xx could be 50k, 100k etc.

"Why is Airbnb frequently blamed for making city centres unaffordable to live in, but other tourist infrastructure isn't?","Hospitality economics student here, we've had this exact discussion with one of our professors:

Essentially, it boils down to the fact that airb'n'b rents out what is meant to be Appartements. People have lower costs of business, which lowers the price, which shifts both the demand and the 'break even' point. Rooms can more easily be allowed to stay empty for a night or two.

Additionally, lessors are able to charge more because, if you have an Appartement that would be worth 1000 $ and you can rent it out as an airb'n'b for 10 out of 30 nights, you can increase the rent while still being able to find a lessee."

/r/CryptoMoonShots - Place to discuss and identify potential low market cap moonshot coins at the earliest stage possible (coins out of top 100 market cap).

Ignorant question: but how is it possible to save enough for retirement?,"Because you don't ""save"" for retirement, you invest for it.

Plenty of responses have mentioned compound interest, but here's how it really works:
 
If you save $10k per year for 40 years, you'll have $400k.

If you *invest* $10k per year at the long-term average market return of 8% per year, after just ten years the *growth* alone is more than $10k, and after 40 years you'd end up with $2.4M.

*That's* how you ""save"" for retirement."

1. Get an emergency fund of 6 months
2. Save 15% plus for retirement
3. Make sure kids college is being saved for
4. Start a savings fund for your truck. Figure out what you can put aside per month, once you have enough to pay it in cash get it.

going out with friends to celebrate someone's birthday for dinner almost financially broke me this budgeting period,"First, what your friends did is dirty underwear behavior.

Second,, I will admit, whenever we do a birthday celebration, the guests typically pay for the birthday person - HOWEVER, that is discussed beforehand OR how much they are willing to contribute. If it wasn't communicated, next time (with better friends) communicate that and say ""hey, I know it's typical to pay for the birthday person OR irs assumed we pay for the birthday person, but I can only contribute 'X' amount to the bill."" OR, if you don't want to be in this situation again...then just don't go and celebrate with the birthday person another time.

"People say not to compare, but it’s not so easy.","If your question is off topic, then my answer is going to be even more so. From your post, I infer that you’re reasonably young. What you need to understand is that life is really long, and a hell of a lot is going to happen to you. By the time you’re 60, you, and your cohort, will have endured a lot. Love, loss, happiness, anger, betrayal, the birth of children, the death of children. It’s going to be hard, because it’s always hard. All lives are full of bone shuddering moments. It’s likely that by the time you’re 60, your desire to compare your material circumstances will have evaporated. So long as you’re safe and secure, you’ll be ok. And a big part of why you’ll be ok is because you’ll have seen how others retreat in to their wealth, their material circumstances, when the going gets tough. I think it was Baldwin who wrote that the great challenge in life is to say yes. A lot of people, faced with how tragic and cruel life can be, will say no. And they’ll retreat into their toys, and their egos, and their judgements; their small cruelties, their vices and self indulgence. If you’re doing it right, by the time you hit middle age, you’ll be judging them for that, rather than judging yourself for not being as well off as others. Their lives will feel hollow to you, and their spoils a snare. Financial security matters a lot, but only to a point, and in the long arc of a life, other things will matter more. Surviving with your heart intact and your head on straight will feel priceless. It’s an easy notion to dismiss, but wait till you see how time disfigures some.

"Warren Buffett, as always, looks like the smartest guy in the room.","People think that just Warren Buffet is doing X or Y, it must be good for them too. Newsflash: *most people are not like Warren Buffet.* When you get very big, it's not so easy to move your fortune without moving the market. You are very illiquid, so you must plan ahead. So, in his context, piling up cash makes a lot of sense. Plus, he can always generate a lot of revenue, which can be reinvested aggressively. Even if his fortune was slashed in half, or 80%-90%, he'd probably still be faring very well.

Contrast that to the typical investor, which has e.g, $ 10,000 in savings. That person is very liquid and nimble, but his/her portfolio can get ravaged easily in markets like these."

UP VOTE IF YOUR BULLISH; DOWN VOTE IF YOUR BEARISH.,"I'm bearish on eth as a whole. Leaky ICOs where they will never be worth more than the day they were funded, the currency is inflationary compared to bitcoin as a store of value, the tech is interesting and has potential but not truly investable unless privately for true equity. For these reasons, I don't see it following bitcoin metrics nor reaching bitcoin prices whatsoever. ICOs will market manipulate and no large scale investor would be willing to take that risk.

However, I am bullish on the price as a stock, it is entirely from my own perspective of what i think eth is worth. at ~$150, it is worth purchasing. Since it has tested the $300 mark, I believe that the market would be willing to invest at these current prices. I don't see it falling under $100. 

The market movement entirely depends on a hedge-fund purchase or large buyer to cause it to spike and the followers will trail, like a stock. If it's just laymen and ICOs, it will never really flourish because ICOs will push the market down inevitably, and with a huge pipeline of ICOs lined up, you can bet on it. 

Just cause it may spike in the next few days/weeks, does not mean it's investable, it means it has reach a pricepoint that an investor would be willing to take a risk to make some profit. It does mean that it will be inevitably cashed out and converted to fiat. 

This is all just my analysis and opinion."
Why do people and the media criticize billionaires for their net worth even though it's not a true measure of their wealth?,"The reason why most billionaires—or rich people in general—don’t have piles of cash sitting around is that it’s far more lucrative to invest the money out and get constant returns. Accumulated wealth can, in fact, exacerbate income inequality. For instance, hypothetically if I own 100mm dollars worth of real estate and collect 5% of the value per year in rent (a standard number), I would earn 5mm extra per year. Sure, the real estate itself isn’t very liquid, but the rent absolutely is. The same would apply to stock dividends, bond payments, etc. 

On a national scale, in fact, 30% of national income is from capital—aka the returns from owning stakes in businesses and other investments. Since the wealthy overwhelmingly own capital, it’s fair to say that they also reap most of this 30%. As a result, even if their net worth doesn’t represent immediately liquid assets, they are still earning a disproportionate amount of money. 

In some instances (Elon Musk comes to mind), business owners aren’t allowed to sell shares until the business hits certain benchmarks. Their shares are less liquid, and I suppose you could argue that they are not as rich as their wealth would imply in the present."
How do you guys with serious net worth do gifts for spouses?,"The specialness of these occasions is rarely tied to wealth. You don't remember expensive gifts, you remember gifts that have meaning.

"Stranger Zelled me $1,000 USD before I even had the chance to call the bank to ask for it to be returned, they filed a chargeback and got my account frozen.","**Don't send any money back!**  Let the bank figure it out.  And go open an account with another bank or credit union, not Chase.  

This is a pretty common scam.  

**Edited to add:**  Here is the problem with sending the money back.  You will be sending your own lovely money, not the stranger's money.  When you authorize your own lovely money to leave your bank account, it says goodbye and then you never see it again.  If you let the bank deal with it, hopefully they don't send your lovely money but instead they reverse the transaction.  There is a significant difference here.  

If you send the money back, you would not be ""refunding"" the stranger's money.  You would be sending your OWN money and the stranger's money may or not be real, valid, or non-fraudulent.  

There are too many problems with zelle to list, and you can find them with a search or two on the internet and a little light reading.  People tend to trust it because they think if it goes from bank to bank and account to account, it can be tracked and clawed back.  But this is apparently not the case.  **Don't use zelle to send significant amounts of money to anybody, including friends and family.**

Also, many people asked ""why not Chase?""  The obvious reason is because OP's account is frozen.  The less obvious reason is because IMHO Chase hires people who are as dumb as rocks.  Your opinion may vary, but just saying ""I've banked with Chase forever and never had a problem"" won't really sway those of us who have.  

Edited again for the Chase defenders:  I advised OP to get an account at another bank because s/he's having problems with Chase.  But in general it's sound practice to have more than one bank account and more than one credit card.  Precisely for this reason."
Do the billionaires actually have the money?,"You're trying to tease out the difference between income and assets.

Income is how much money Jeff Bezos puts into his checking account every year. This is ""cash money"" that Jeff can use to buy milk, air planes, rare paintings, rocket ships, or whatever else he wants. Jeff reports this income to the IRS and pays taxes like everyone else.

Assets are the total value of everything Jeff owns and could sell to generate income. For Jeff, his assets are primarily Amazon stock. The sum total of Jeff's assets (minus his debts) is the ~$100B valuation that you commonly see for his net worth.

The majority of Jeff's income comes from stock that he sells. The IRS then collects taxes on the capital gains from those stock sales. For Jeff, this saves a ton of money in taxes, because his long term capital gains tax rate is 20% compared to his income tax rate of 37% (assuming Jeff has income of &gt; ~$500k per year which we all know is a pretty safe assumption).

When politicians talk about taxing billionaires, they're often talking about increasing taxes on capital gains to try and tax more of that income that is disproportionately held by billionaires compared to the average taxpayer. Some politicians also propose adding additional income tax tiers to target the ultra wealthy as the current top income tax tier of 37% is the same whether Jeff makes $510k, $5M, or $5B this year."

1 year follow up: Moved from VHCOL to MCOL (and FIREd),"Congrats on what sounds like successfully being FIREd! It's great that you found things to do in your spare time so that you don't feel the need to do some work to feel like you have a purpose. I know people who struggle with that aspect after they've FIREd for a while, so it's refreshing to hear that you figured that part out early on.

&gt; If I was going to guess, though I’ve never tried, trying to explain FIRE to neighbors is received as well as selling them the newest MLM scam.

Each time I've told people that I'm retired, it didn't turn out bad. They may look shocked at first, but most people understand that retiring early is not a radical idea. Seems more like that's what most people wish they could do if they had the means to do so.

Clients will see 10,000,000 shares in their accounts but those shares have not actually been traded or bought, they're just obligations. These prime brokers help eachother out. You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

The only way these obligations have to end up in purchases is when you DRS. By DRS you force them to have positive share balances at DTCC to transfer to you. This is where the buy in pressure comes."

They give as good an opinion as most other economists will be able to provide you.


But the general answer I can give you is that there are a few factors to this, one is when a countries economy tends to be uber centralised in one economic hub (London is a good example), which is subsequent and consequent to other factors like most high paying jobs being concentrated in the city leading to a surge in demand elasticity in two ways ( more people looking for a home plus people being able to afford to pay more for a home) and generally a surge in foreign investment which creates a second levy of scarcity on the house ownership and house investment market. This tends to happen at an even stronger level when you have a burgeoning econony like Israel's."

There was a legendary discussion in March 2000 on that board wherein one of the more prolific posters, JABoa, talked about how they'd bought a $12,000 harpsichord (in 1984) and considered it one of the best purchases of their life.   The poster took an absolute beating by the other members.  The community there was more typically a hard core cost-savings leanishFIRE community (although nobody called it that back then).

Then about a year later the OP died and one astute poster realized that the old argument about the harpsichord where everyone had piled onto him was the same guy whose untimely death they were all mourning.

The post and thread [can be seen here](https://boards.fool.com/lbym-pariahs-revisited-the-harpsichord-15015155.aspx) and I often think back about it and the guy.  Life can be short and unpredictable.  It's important to make time and allocate spending while we're still here to enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the data breaches that have been happening over the last few years this is unfortunately going to become more and more common. Here's a few suggestions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Use a password manager and use secure passwords. Using the password generator in the password manager is the best approach if at all possible.
2. Setup 2FA on every account that you can, especially your e-mail accounts. Use an authentication like Google Authenticator and use SMS as a last resort.
3. Be wary of sites that you sign up for and what information you provide.
4. Regularly check your computer for malware/viruses. There are several out there that install ""key loggers"" on your computer or device to intercept your passwords as you type them in. Running regular checks of your devices with multiple scanners (Malwarebytes, ESET online scanner, Emsisoft Emergency Kit, TDSSKILLER, etc) is the best way to make sure you are clean.
5. Setup alerts on all financial accounts, particularly on bank and credit card accounts. I have alerts setup for any transaction $1.00 or more (or whatever the minimum is) and receive SMS and e-mail alerts the moment a transaction happens.

Glad you caught this so quickly and avoided a much bigger problem. Amazon's customer service is the best in the industry so I am not sure why that experience was ""weird"" for you. You mentioned they were dodgy. I would imagine this situation was not something that the lower level customer service reps deal with. They're likely used to the typical ""process my refund"", ""cancel my order"", etc type phone calls. The great thing about Amazon is it's very easy to cancel an order via the online portal. Change your password and setup 2FA.

&amp;#x200B;

What other scammers do in these cases if they have access to your e-mail is setup a filter to have these e-mails go straight to trash. They could setup a filter that would have any e-mails coming from Amazon bypass your inbox and go straight to trash. Honestly, this would have been the better way for them to do it but I would imagine they likely didn't have access to your e-mail account, which is why they wanted to flood the account instead."

Starting a Value Hedge Fund,"Considering that the hedge fund business is about having connections with very very wealthy people, he probably could not start one.

What are ways in which it would be feasibly possible to tax billionaires?,"&gt;The top comment was ""they dont actually have that much money. That's how much stock they own in the company. That's not cash or expandable resources."" The comment went on to essentially say that all of these billionaires wealth was hypothetical and non existent in the effect that they don't actually have that much money to spend, and if they did pull out that much money it would cripple the companies. (wouldn't other people just buy that sold stock though? If a billionaire actually did decide to pay himself a billionaires salary, would there actually be enough money to give to them or at this point is the money more abstract?

It's a dumb argument tbh.

We mostly don't tax things at 100%, or anywhere close. And there's a good reason for that, taxes discourage whatever they tax. If you would tax income at 100%, people would have no incentive to work. If you work and earn zero extra money compared to just sitting at home, whittling birds or whatever, why work?

Same with wealth taxes. If you tax wealth at 100%, and it becomes apparent that this realistically becomes law, why even stay in the country? Even if we assume leaving is unrealistically expensive and you'd lose 90% of your wealth that way, it's still a better option than staying and losing 100%. It's also not a proposal anyone remotely serious about wealth taxes makes.

Actual wealth tax proposals are to the tune of 3% down to less than 0.5%. And it's not like that would be some kind of unforeseen event, law gets passed and these people know that within a year they need X amount of money. I'm sure Jeff Bezos could scrounge together a billion over the span of a year without crashing the value of his assets. [He has no trouble selling 3 billion worth of shares within a week, after all.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/04/bezos-sells-more-than-3-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares-.html)

Not to mention that it's stupid for other reasons. If we'd tax away 25% of Jeff Bezos' wealth today to finance the government, we can do that a couple of times until his wealth is much smaller. That helps temporarily, but eventually that money is just gone and 10 years from now all these things bought via the tax can't be financed any more.

In short, the big concern is really capital flight, people moving their wealth out of the country. And in that regard, chances are that a low wealth tax (0.5-2% for example), together with exit fees, could reasonably avoid severe detrimental effects.

Although this is sadly not necessarily sufficient to draw conclusions about other countries, it shows that this can work in principle.

&gt;Is it not possible to tax the ultra rich worth since they all have such low salaries?  What is a realistic option to effectively tax the wealthy?

We're already taxing the wealthy. We don't necessarily need magic bullets, either.

The top 1% of taxpayers already pay over a third of all income taxes. There's little reason why we couldn't just.. tax them more.

https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/

Even erring on the side of caution and ""just"" creating a new tax bracket, 45% at 1 mil. and 50% at 10 mil. for example would be a substantial increase over the current maximum 37%. There's little reason not to just do that, as far as I'm aware.

There are other straightforward avenues. A carbon tax and dividend scheme is pretty easy to make progressive, and carbon emissions are pretty strongly correlated with income.

Or just straight up a consumption tax.

https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/05/a_consumption_t.html

&gt;Are caps on how much wealthy can make the only realistic option considering how difficult it is to tax them?

No, caps on wealth or income just discourage too much. They effectively act like a 100% tax past the threshold."
what is president biden’s role in causing and mitigating inflation ?,"Inflation in the short run changes according to the total amount of demand in the economy (aggregate demand) vs the economy's productive capacity (aggregate supply). Inflation will tend to accelerate if the economy is overheating (aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply), and will tend to decelerate if the economy is in a recession (aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply).

There have been two factors driving inflation. i) Aggregate Supply has been reduced by the various COVID related production and supply chain issues - not President Biden's fault. ii) Aggregate Demand has increased in the last year, partly by the reopening of the economy and partly by the various coronavirus relief and stimulus packages. If Biden had not supported or had vetoed the various coronavirus relief and stimulus packages last year, inflation would be lower this year. On the other hand, people would have suffered more, unemployment would be higher, and the economy would not be booming today. 

The Federal Reserve has contributed to the inflationary environment by being dovish and signaling that interest rate will not rise for some time. On the other hand, inflation had been below target for some years and they were strongly motivated to raise it. They may have been overly dovish in retrospect, but central banking is not an easy task, since we can only know the past and not the future. It can be compared with trying to drive a car while only looking in the rearview mirror."
"Laid off and daytrading. 28k in, PDT, and margin. My apprenticeship, if you will.","*Great honest article - thanks for sharing.*

*I agree on your 'current strategy'*

*except I never use margin. Never.* 

*I have a large diversified portfolio of long term investments. Many are boring dividend stocks for long term income like CEF's (closed end funds), Baby bonds, MLP's, BDC's (Business development companies) and Preferred stocks. These pay from about 5% to 12% in dividends. The average of my dividend holdings pays 8.5%. The 'Rule of 72' applies here. For instance $100k at 8.5% with dividends re-invested will double in about 8.2 years. (however with growth this will be higher) Modest but safe in both up and down markets. At retirement one can then take the dividends as income without touching the principle and live well.*  

Then I have a set amount for 'trading' either day trades or swing trades.

**Never hold overnight**  *Absolutely* \- *stop losses don't work in the aftermarket. close it out at day end or before. I will sometimes break this rule for a great momentum stock, then watch it like a hawk. But will still close out before aftermarket closes at 8:30 pm*

**Don't chase a trade down.**  *agreed - put in a stop loss for what your willing to risk. For me that's 2 to 3% max. -$300.00 on a 10k trade - If it moves up you can change it to break even. Then higher if it's really trending up. Once the trade is profitable, I widen the stop so as not to get stopped out due to volatility. For instance if I'm up 10% I'll move the stop to 5% over my buy point so as to lock in a 5% gain if it tanks. I Never second guess my stop loss. This takes emotion out of the trade.*

 **Green is green.   If your trade is successful, take the profit.**   *Absolutely.* 

*Here's a method I've used for many years that is 87% successful on momentum trades.*

*For a stock with upward momentum.*

*At the open it will often trade up quickly.*  

*This is NOT the time to enter.*

*Then it will drop before POSSIBLY rising to new highs.*

*This is the time to enter.*

*How?*

*I keep a chart of the SPY open. (or QQQ if trading tech) If SPY is tanking usually all bets are off.*

*Pull up a one day chart of the chosen stock. Set up with candlesticks at 1 minute intervals.*

*Wait for the dip - Then wait for consolidation and an upward trend. You cannot catch the exact bottom and don't want to grab a falling knife.*

*An upward trend is indicated by some evening out/consolidation then two to three or more green candlesticks.*  

*That is a good entry point. It works appr. 87% of the time on momentum plays.*

*Sometimes you won’t get the initial trade up at the open but during pre-market then a drop at the open - - You use the same strategy as above.*  

*If you look at many charts you'll see this pattern fairly regularly. This is based on my 30+ years of trading - but is just my two cents and certainly not fail proof. (worth what you paid for it) - smiles*

"Daily General Discussion - February 5, 2018","Sorry if you are new and underwater, or maybe not so new and close to being underwater, but this is how it works. Be ready for some more red. 

There are big players in this game with a lot of experience and the power to make waves in the market. These guys know how to get every last bit of profit out of market movements. They have enough buying and selling power to trigger market movements. 

When the price was high, they sold. That money will buy back when it is most profitable for them to do so, I.e.: the support line. We won't get there until everyone that is going to sell sells. 

If you are inexperienced as a trader, you basically have two choices at this point, sell or hold. It's very risky to trade the ups and downs at this point. 

If you hold, be prepared for much more red. Be prepared to lose it all. You most probably won't. Be prepared for flatness. Be prepared for *oh look it's going up, oh shit, it's back down*. Be prepared for trolls saying shit like *I've set buy orders from 250 down to 100* trying to freak you out. The best thing to do is leave this sub and never check the price, but we know that isn't going to happen. 

Eventually the big players will have deprived the desperate of a price increase for long enough that they have sold everything to them at the lowest possible price and the price will rise again, making the big players the absolute maximum profit and lifting you back out of the water.

"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but is the stock market and the economy correlated?","It’s not a dumb question - it’s a basic one that most people assume they know the answer to but don’t.

To start, what is the “stock market?” Simply put it’s a “The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place” (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp).

The stock market is where investors can buy equity from other companies in hopes of selling that equity at a higher price and making money or receiving dividends (please see edit below for clarification). 

Now what is an economy? 

“An economy is the large set of inter-related production and consumption activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are allocated” (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp).

Basically an “economy” is just word that describes how people spend their money.

What’s the relationship?

The relationship is direct (at times). If the economy is doing well then the market is doing well. Likewise vice versa. 

Here’s an example of where that wasn’t the case.

(https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/541/economics/relationship-between-stock-market-and-economy/)

“In October 1987, stock markets around the world fell 25%. Many feared this predicted a major global recession. In response policymakers cut interest rates. But, the stock market crash appeared to have no bearing on the economy. The late 1980s were a boom time in many western economies. Even now, investors are not entirely sure why share prices fell 25%. Some blame ‘technical factors.’”

Why is this the case? Well the economy really isn’t composed of expectations - the stock market is.

What does that mean? Well, an economy can chug along regardless of what anyone thinks of it. Financial markets are really dependent on parties agreeing on the prices of the equity and debt that is being traded.

That’s a really simple overview of a pretty complicated topic. Thanks for asking and thanks to the guys replying to me pointing out my mistakes. 

EDIT: for clarification: when I used the term “stock market” I was using it in the vernacular of “all financial markets” which is what most people think when they talk about the stock market. Technically there are a couple financial markets (stock market, bond market, so on and so forth).

I tried to make things simple but I don’t want to feed you misinformation. Here is an article on the subject (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-bond-stock-market.asp).

Also, I was too lax when describing the economy: please refer to the reply below for a better description of what economy is.

Gold ETFs/MFs offer an easy SIP investment in gold, whereas the SGBs are made only for lumpsum investments (that not everybody can afford). Thus due to the SIP nature of MFs, it becomes possible to keep ""buying on dips"".

Also, the interest part of SGBs is only applicable on maturity of 8 years."

Why do companies need to have such substantial growth rates? Why can’t a company say “we’re happy with the profits we made last year”?,"&gt;If a company makes its shareholders Xthousand dollars this year, why do they need to make 10% more the next year?

Well, it depends.

You don't necessarily *need* to grow. Especially in well established industries, you could chose to be perfectly fine with your spot in the market and don't aim for (much) growth.

On the other hand, in some industries, this might be necessary. If your industry moves so fast that if you don't innovate and stay competitive you fall behind and lose more and more market share. Nobody would buy a smartphone from a company that hasn't changed since 2010.

That said, companies actually owned by shareholders usually have an obligation to make a profit (at least eventually), because from a shareholder perspective, that's the point and that's how you profit from owning a company. 

&gt;This growth, in many well established companies/industries is not organic and is predatory, unsustainable, and often downright cruel.

What do you base that on? Companies have grown at a decent pace just fine and there have always been high and low growth industries. Sure, some companies are ""bad"" or unsustainable, but to suggest that's a significant portion doesn't really make much sense."

"If federal debt isn't important, then why do we still have taxes?","&gt; I see lots of people arguing that the federal debt isn't important so long as it's issued in fiat currency.

They're wrong. Higher debt means higher interest payments, which means less money available for general government spending (as well as the need to collect money for interest payments via taxes).

What people usually mean by this is ""debt isn't a big deal because, in a bind, the government could just print money to pay off the debt."" This ignores two factors: 1) the U.S. government (as well as most governments around the world) does not currently have the legal ability to print money (only the Federal Reserve, or central banks, can print money) and more importantly 2) printing money to pay off the debt (as opposed to taxes) would cause inflation."

"To achieve maximum economic benefits, how long should a working week be?","I agree with zzzzz94.

We've discussed this before on AskEconomics.  It never seems to turn out well.  There are lots of shadow-banned comments here.  You're not missing very much by not seeing them.  I rather like the one suggesting an 8-day working week though, I might approve that one.

We see all-sorts of headlines about this.  The Foo corporation experiments with a 4 days workweek and it's a great success.  Or, occasionally, the Bar company experiments with a 4 day workweek and goes back to a 5 day workweek.  None of this is very enlightening.

Each job is different.  Jobs requires different amounts of physical and mental energy.  They also attract different types of people who value different things.  That's why there are different patterns of working.  Many people work part-time now.  Many workers in production work shifts.  Similarly, those who work in operations that have to be on-call also work shifts - e.g. fireman and doctors.

Businesses and organizations choose what they believe is the right structure for each part operations.  Businesses are optimizing for points 3, 4 &amp; 5 on the OP's list.  On the other side, workers choose which businesses offer the conditions they prefer.  It's like pay, and perks, it's something that a person evaluates when considering a job.  They are optimizing for 1 &amp; 2 on the OP's list.

There is no good justification for the state changing private employment contracts through legislations.

Lastly, we have to remember that ultimately the individual is in control.  In a free society neither the state nor the businesses can really change much.  People can always retire and they can spend time unemployed.  People can always work at their own projects in their own time.  If the working week is too long for most people's preferences then they will take breaks between jobs or retire early.  If the working week is too short for people's preferences then they'll work part-time in other jobs, or in household production."

Why do pharmacists make so much in the US?,"Pharmacists make more in the US because the educational requirements are much, much higher.  In the US you typically get a science BS degree with lots of prerequisites (4 years of college) and then another 4 years of graduate school to get the ""Pharm D"" degree.

In the UK, it is just a 4-year degree that they call an MPharm degree.  Half the education, you get half the pay?

Additionally, my guess is that in the UK the typical pharmacist works solo (but I could be very wrong about that). In the US pharmacists manage a team of 2-6 pharmacy techs underneath them, and the pharmacist has to check behind them, and is responsible for any mistakes they make."

"Why does US and Europe need so many international students to fill PhD and Master's positions whereas China, Japan and S. Korea does not?","Not so much an Economic answer, but rather a Sociological one.

Studying Masters/PhD isn't deemed a necessity in the west, but it is in Asia. Why? Because everyone else is doing it. One couldn't compete without having the necessary qualifications. 

You can also see this reflected in government spending. Education has always been deemed as a future investment. There is no need to invest now, because there are other priorities. In times of trouble, education and healthcare tend to be the first investment to be lowered because the immediate effects aren't there. It is only after several years that you see it starting to get backed up and countries start ranking lower in terms of educational advancement. Jobs also do not tend to require you to have a Masters either, so if the educational competition doesn't exist or is very limited, socially speaking, there is no need to get that certificate.

As such, with the lack of funding from student tuition, and, therefore, government support, they need it to be filled with foreign students."
"Do any economists study ""apocalypse"" economics?","Yes, there are plenty of economists who study global catastrophic risks. Many of them are at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute and Global Priorities Institute, both of which are associated with the effective altruism movement.

Would the economy be better off if we had not addressed covid-19 and let the virus run rampant?,"No, because consumer behavior would have changed.

And that's to say nothing not employee behavior. How many minimum wage employees keep showing up if their highly replaceable job might kill them?

There would still have been a massive contraction of consumer spending. And as the virus got worse, and deaths increased, this voluntary lockdown would increase.

This is one of the points I often make when folks complain about my state's lockdown (WA state). Even if the restrictions are lifted, consumer activity will still be suppressed. Fighting off the pandemic now the path to economic recovery."
"4/20 “Share Recall” Explained- Why it’s important that shares must be recorded-Is this the Catalyst?🚀🚀🚀 If you’re still on Margin, CONTACT YOUR BROKERS","This needs to be upvoted ASAP.

I got a $4/hr pay increase. My yearly salary only went up $1k. I'm confused.,"This post is all over the place.

&gt;I did some rough calculations (my paydays x4, plus $225 insurance bonus)

Sounds like you did your math wrong. You didn’t get a $4 per day raise, you got a $4 per hour raise. If you estimate around 250 working days you would incorrectly get $1000 more. You instead work about 2000 hrs., which is a $8000 increase.

&gt;$10k more yearly ($55k from $43k)

&gt;salary which is $33k

Is your salary $33k or $43k? Are you talking about gross or net? Is it a $10,000 increase or a $12,000 increase to one of these?

It’s unclear to me if your 401(k) match is a flat 25% match of your gross salary, or a 25% of what you (are forced to) contribute.

If you expect a $8000 pay increase and get 25% ($2000) of that in 401(k) that *would* be $10000 so it kind of sounds like the first.

But these are just guesses, because ultimately your numbers don’t really make sense. It’s unclear about what you mean, and so any of the answers here are not going to be good."

Life has gotten so much more expensive since Covid has “ended”,"It s also a combination of many other factor.
One of them is the lack of workers.
Eg there is not enough lorry drivers. The ones that are working are doing extra and are all overworked and able to ask for much more money. 
Same is happening with the catering and building trades. 

Brexit did not make things easy either.

"The SGC / XST ""Scam""","Firstly, I gotta say I respect someone doing a retrospective on their losses. It's an important part of the process.

I'm an oil and gas engineer. Oil and gas exploration is such a gambling game, hence that this flair exists (good work on flairing correctly btw). Mining exploration is basically linear algebra compared to this stuff. Even after the discovery, time to production is often measured in decades. Operations meanwhile is often the opposite. Gas plant compositions and operations change on yearly basis, mining it can be daily.

I never go in on either of these. A few reasons.

1. The numbers for gas volume and oil volume can be very misleading. There is oil and gas almost everywhere. The earth is really fucking old and there was certainly a Forrest or swamp everywhere at some point. The problem is if a well takes a few million to drill, will that well be pushing out 100k SCUMs (I hate scf as a unit by the way), or do we need to frack the shit out of it to get limited production going for 3 years. The volume numbers are always dodgy for that reason. Major projects (not the ones I've worked on, but the industry grapevine is strong) are finding themselves short on gas because the geological analysis was wrong.

2. I work in the industry. Everyone is looking at the exit. I mean everyone. Lithium will only absorb so much. We have plenty of gas in Australia already, anyone who speaks of a shortage is lying our their ass. There are however a number of poor geology reports which have meant major exporters are short of gas production. Apart from these guys, there is easily enough gas to last Australia to the point where our allies start applying taxes on us because we're still using gas like savages (which I estimate will be in the mid 2030s.)

So ask yourself the question, given exploration is always a gamble, will you jump in on a gamble squared. I have a few $500 punts on dumb shit exploration companies, but I know they are lottery tickets, nothing more."
Americans younger than 50 hold just 16% of all investable assets,"For those of you asking about the aging population:

Common personal finance mistakes,"&gt;  Stop investing in Unit Linked Insurance Plans.

I just can't believe how terrible ULIPs are. People get baited in with sales talk about how they'll get ""great"" returns and a few anecdotes how other people have been getting these great returns but have been losing money investing in normal mutual funds.

A salesperson (who also sold my dad several of these ULIPs) asked me to invest in one. She kept going on about how their fund has been getting amazing returns and how I can get insurance bundled in with it. I know that dad has invested in them, so I thought they're probably fine.

I read their policy document and I honestly could not believe how incredibly shitty the plan was. There was a 3% ""Premium allocation charge"" (which itself was enough for me to stop considering it), Fund management charge of 1.5% (similar to TER for MFs), policy admin charges of 60 per month, discontinuance charge before 5 years and bunch of other bullshit charges.

 When I told her that I'd rather put this money into some mutual funds she told me how everything good in life will have service charges, and that their ""amazing"" fund managers can provide much higher returns than index fund (which provide mediocre returns btw according to her). I realised that my father became a victim to their sales pitch and made him understand why he should stay clear of them in the future."
Why do people call Warren Buffett an “investing genius” if the tenets he follows aren’t extraordinarily difficult to replicate?,"I would volunteer what is probably an unpopular opinion. His method doesn't require a great intellect (he has said so himself) what it does require is a lot of time and work. You can search and filter every stock on the market for pe or other ratios in seconds but it will take 30-45 minutes to dig through 10 years of 10-ks just to understand a company's free cash flow (and that's before you've assessed debt, cash and cash equivalents, profit margins, and the business itself). His method isn't hard, it's just time consuming. In this day and age where you can buy a stock in seconds spending over an hour to do the bare minimum DD seems ludicrous to the average retail investor."
"Curious to hear economists' breakdown of Einstein's ""Why Socialism?""","Hayek wrote about this in his final book “The fatal conceit” where he said basically this paper is proof that if you’re really super smart at one thing it is by no means obvious you will be really super smart at _everything_. He went on to say that Einstein is one of many who made the mistake of thinking that production for “use” would be entirely different than production for “profit”, because he never took the time to understand how and why profit is created in the first place by entrepreneurs and savers. Production for profit essentially guarantees that in a free market the means of mass production will be used to satisfy the most amount of consumers, whereas production for “use” basically means the advocate wants to personally designate what is and isn’t useful/ should be put into mass production. It is the classical line of thinking against voting with your wallet, which Hayek says is the most radical form of unrestricted democracy (every dollar is a vote cast in a ballot every second of every day), and so Einstein is accidentally making an authoritarian/ undemocratic argument by trying to be radically egalitarian and anti-the-excesses of capitalism. Hayek finishes by saying that Einstein never tried to study how an economy _does_ work, but jumped straight into the debate of how an economy _should_ work, which is just a tale of hubris."

"Given the progressive tax system in the U.S., why do the poor pay a larger percent of their income in taxes than the rich?","Its not clear since he doesn't mention what tax brackets he is referring to  - my guess is he is referring to the concept of a welfare cliff which raises effective Marginal Tax Rates(MTRs) for people at the bottom. See this [paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27164) which calculates the net(after all taxes + transfers) effective MTRs across lifetime.

&gt;One in four low-wage workers face marginal net tax rates above 70 percent, effectively locking them into poverty. Over half face remaining lifetime marginal net tax rates above 45 percent. The richest 1 percent also face a high median lifetime marginal tax rate – roughly 50 percent


This [graph](https://i.imgur.com/2Nqme1P.png) in particular shows some poor people face MTRs as high as 100-200% !! - this happens because an additional $X in earnings disqualifies you from $Y of govt benefits where Y  &gt;&gt; X so effectively you get taxed $Y for earning $X extra."

Tenant got a $1500 water bill,"Typically the Water Company will have a program to reduce the bill if it was noted that there was damage and a fix was done.

In my opinion, and the way that I manage my properties, the toilet is a fixture that is my responsibility.  If I don't properly maintain it, the damage stems from me.  If the tenant drop a bowling ball in the toilet or their child flushed a toy down the toilet that would be their damage."

"How accurate is this study that says ""socialist"" countries have a higher quality of life than ""capitalist"" countries","They seem to ""control"" for economic development (by stratifying countries into low-income, low-middle, high-middle, high) which is a *post treatment variable*. Think about it like this, political system (socialist or capitalist) can have a direct effect on health outocome (PQL) and an indirect effect via economic development (since political system can induce or reduce development). Controlling for economic development will mute the indirect effect channel.

Second, economic development is likely to be a *collider*. In that case conditioning on a collider will result in something called [endogenous selection bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6089543/). (more accessible [blog](https://p-hunermund.com/2018/08/27/why-you-shouldnt-control-for-post-treatment-variables-in-your-regression/) on why conditioning/controlling for collider is wrong).

Third, it is hard to believe that their independent variables (gdp/capita and  binary socialist or capitalist) are truly exogenous to PQL. this will result in a correlation between their independent variables &amp; the error term and cause [endogeneity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(econometrics\)).

Fourth, there seems to be a lot of heterogeniety in their ""capitalist"" bucket. Anything from India to US is grouped as ""capitalist"".

Is anyone here conflicted about investing in companies that make the world a worse place?,"You'll find that a lot of mutual funds, institutions, and even the Canadian Pension Plan hold shares in many unethical companies, including oil, weapons manufacturers, Palantir, Amazon, and the list goes on. Idk if this helps you feel better, but you're not the one making the world a worse place. Our hypercapitalist society has created a consumerist world where corporations are rewarded for exploiting the world and it's not changing anytime soon. It's survival of the fittest and there's something to be said about businesses that become extremely efficient in making money, because profits and shareholders are their only goal. They actively lobby international governments, bypass regulations, and promote the status quo to ensure their own success. When Amazon manipulated the unionization vote and workers failed to unionize, their stock surges. When Facebook bypasses privacy laws, their stock goes up. As a shareholder, I hope you learned through investing how our society is, and it has been like that for human history. The post-WW2 era had a lot of talk about decolonization, but in reality, the actions of colonialism through exploiting resources and climate change (which harms poorer nations more) are still there.

Unless you're investing in an IPO/DPO, you're not directly contributing to the company anyways unless they issue more shares to raise capital. Money is power, and if you're not the one profiting, others who are oblivious or are actively promoting this will, as you see in these other subreddits. Humans are greedy, especially when money is involved. You're a good person for noticing this, and I would rather you invest and have a financially secure future so that you can create a bigger impact on society. Whether that's being an activist, volunteering with your MPs or MPPs during an election, or even running for office yourself. Having money will give you more potential in helping to solve these concerns you raised.

Apologize with the politics/philosophy, but on another note, climate change is a serious threat. However, there is absolutely no way we can fight climate change unless we significantly change our current state of capitalism. The decision of whether to invest or not invest in shares is simply a drop in the water."

Why doesn’t a strong USD cancel out inflation?,"It's complicated. There are several factors. I'll talk about the US:

1\. A lot of inflation was caused by the easy-money policies of the Fed in 2021. That creates domestic inflation which is not easily compensated for by cheaper imports.

2\. In the US imports only make up ~13% of GDP. Then you have to remember that the USD has not risen so much. The dollar index is up ~11% comparing the start of the year to today. So, at the most an 11% reduction in 13% of purchases. Not enough to make much of a difference.

Is Covid relief a major F U to landlords or am I missing something?,"The entire policy surrounding relief seems to only look at one side of an equation and ignore the other.

* Tenants get eviction protection, but landlords are still on the hook for bills.

* The unemployed get money to sit at home, but the essential workers (many of whom are not *really* all that essential) still have to work full time for less wages at a higher risk

* They give out small business loans to help struggling business owners, but they let them all get gobbled up by large companies that shouldn't qualify while the banks cash in on origination fees

They wanted to rush out some legislature to have good optics to the general public, but its clear there was a sheer lack of critical thought that went into it"
Why are land value taxes so rare?,"[William Fischel](https://economics.dartmouth.edu/people/william-fischel) gives two reasons in *Zoning Rules*:

&gt;One reason is administrative. The difficulties of disentangling land value from present and past owners’ contributions of capital and labor are not just theoretical (Steven Bourassa 2009). In order to apply a land tax to a parcel, the value of the parcel must be assessed by a public official. [...] Most land of any value within a community already has something attached to it and is already subject to taxation.

&gt;To administer a land value tax, local assessors have to distinguish the value of a home or office building from the value of its underlying land. For many assessors, this task makes as much sense as trying to separate the value of the first floor of the house from the second floor. (Practicing assessors said as much in Daniel Holland [1970].) The building and its land “are intimately related—that is what makes them collectively “real” property—and they are almost always sold as a unit. The sales of vacant lots in some communities, occasionally resulting from “teardowns” of existing homes, offer some basis for comparisons on which land values could be assessed (Dye and McMillen 2007). But vacant land is often so special in its situation (there may have been some unusual reason it remained vacant or the previous building was demolished) that assessors are naturally skeptical of using it as a basis for assessing other land.

And in Pittsburgh, where such a system was implemented:

&gt;voters nonetheless rejected their longstanding tax system after a countywide reassessment revealed to voters that a small and a large home in the same neighborhood could have the same land values and thus pay close to the same amount of taxes (Bourassa 2009). But such disparities are inherent in any system of land value taxation and are indeed one of its supposed virtues, according to economists. The owner of the small house is not discouraged from building more rooms, as would be the case under a normal property tax system. Popular feelings about the fairness of property taxes—people in larger houses should pay proportionately more—seemed to have trumped such issues.

So in brief, they are difficult to implement and perceived as unfair. There are also more exotic critiques of land value taxes, e.g., [Gochenour and Caplan (2012)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1999105)."

After training, use the sauna and cold tank, then eat lunch. 

Sometimes I’ll take a nap if training was particularly hard.

How exactly did the 2008 bubble pop?,"The bulk of the mortgages making up the CDOs in the 2008 crisis were adjustable rate loans which would change as the market moved. These loans were offered out to consumers at teaser rates that were incredibly affordable, then after several years the rate would expire and a more market appropriate rate would kick in, often 2 or 3 times larger than the teaser rate. 

The mortgage industry ramped up heavily in 2004/2005 and peaked in 2006. In 2007 the teaser rates started to kick in, meaning people who were hypothetically paying $600 per month for a mortgage would suddenly find themselves owing $2000 or even more. That lead to foreclosures which lead to CDOs having reduced value as the mortgages backing them up dried out and stopped paying. 

Since large banks had taken on not only CDOs but synthetic CDOs, or CDOs of CDOs, their profit generation became dependent on mortgages not defaulting. They used the massive amount of expected income from CDOs to leverage their money and were essentially operating on credit rather than making deals backed by actual cash. 

Eventually in 2008 default rates on mortgages hit the point that suddenly many CDOs were now expecting to make less money than the banks originally paid for them, making them worthless and an actual drain on their accounts. Once this moment hit in the first quarter of 2008 every institution looked at their books factoring in the new default rates and realized the majority of their products were worthless. Add that to credit default swaps that basically every bank held against each other pretty much every large bank realized they were tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in debt when they expected to make money that year. That realization in the summer of 2008 is what popped the bubble as they tried to unload debt on to other banks.

There was no one moment where everyone realized. The writing was on the wall for 2 years and people only started to open their eyes and accept reality very slowly."

What are the primary reasons cities get more expensive and more gentrified?,"Let's separate this into two questions. First, why have cities grown so much? And secondly, why have living costs in cities risen so much? Edward Glaeser has done a lot of great work on this topic--and if you want a longer read, you can check out his book ""Triumph of the City"".

For some shorter reads, [this New York Times article](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/why-has-globalization-led-to-bigger-cities/) explains that cities facilitate information flows and knowledge sharing that make workers more productive. Some of his academic studies on this include [this 2001 study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4728.pdf) (showing that cities increase the productivity and skill development of workers, leading to higher wages) and this [1992 study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261856).

Why have cities become so expensive? Not all cities have--many of them actually remain quite affordable. The cities that have seen skyrocketing costs are due to a [constrained housing supply](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/g4bdb0/oc_the_increase_in_us_housing_prices_relative_to/fnwed99?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), primarily from land controls and excessive zoning regulations.

As a simple example, Glaeser told the story of three housing markets in one of his papers:

&gt; In lightly regulated housing markets with growing population and economies, like Atlanta, the supply curve for housing is relatively flat. Thus, as demand for housing expands over time, the result is that competition in the home building industry holds the price of housing reasonably close to its minimum profitable production cost. In heavily regulated housing markets with growing economies, like the San Francisco Bay area, the supply curve for housing slopes up. As a result, additional demand for housing translates into prices that are substantially above the minimum profitable production cost, with rising land values driving up total costs. Finally, in a housing market like Detroit where the demand for housing declined sharply over time, the supply curve for housing has a kink at the existing level of housing because housing is durable and does not diminish quickly when demand falls. As a result, a reduction in demand leads to lower prices for housing and minimal new construction 

To illustrate this, I made a [chart here](https://imgur.com/a/26vbMLJ) showing the changing prices in those three housing markets."

2. Most of the home are owned in full or owner have large equity so they don't have to sell in distress at lower price.
3. Real estate is best protection against inflation. With inflation averaging 7% over past 40 years money is bound to flow into real estate as it is a safe heaven.
4. Lack of alternative investment opportunities as stock market is not matured enough as well as too risky for most people where as bond market is not accessible to retail investors.
5. High societal pressure and prestige attached to owning your own home."
Why was the federal reserve unable to prevent inflation in the 1980’s?,"The 1970s and 1980s saw a paradigm shift in economic thinking about inflation. The phenomena that existed at that time is called ""Stagflation"" because there was both inflation and high unemployment at the same time. According to the dominant theory at the time (Keynesianism) this should not have been possible. Monetarism was the new theory that did a much better job explaining the stagflation of the 70s/80s. The following decades would see many attempts to merge keynesianism with monetarism into a single theory.

My lessons in buying gold,"Let me offer a different perspective, 

While I agree that Gold is a hedge against inflation,  that statement in itself doesn't convey reality.

But a very few who know the difference between Money and Currency,  invest in Gold , Physical Gold , to protect against the downfall of Currency ie Fiat Currency. 

It could be the downfall of US Dollar or a situation like Venezuela/ Zimbabwe. 

Fiat Currency of these countries are worthless.

So if you are anticipating a world where US Dollar crashes or Local political turmoil, Physical Gold is your best bet.

This is why Gold and Silver are considered Money whereas others are termed Currency , meaning Money is a store of value and doesn't lose its purchasing power even in the rise &amp; fall of empire. 

A gold bar or coin could buy something today and it would have bought something during the Roman Empire as well.

Can someone please explain calls for me?,"A call option is a contract that gives you the option to buy a stock at a predetermined price. A put option (opposite of a call) allows you to sell at some price.

E.g. BMO stock trades for $100. A call option with a strike price of $105 sells for $3 and expires in February. If you buy the call option from me it means that I have to sell you my BMO share for $105 (only of you want to buy it).

If BMO jumps to $106 you can buy my share for $105 and immediately sell it on the market for a $1 profit. But you paid me $3 for the contract so you lost $2.

Don't give an Ether address AND your Reddit username together!,"That thread whereby the guy was giving away .01 ETH because ""he was out"" made no sense other than to get a huge list of Reddit usernames tied to Wallet details. (Perhaps spreading FUD...but if you're out, why give your ETH away?)

Taking the top comment in the thread, the individual used a fresh wallet to receive the 0.01 ETH, sure, fine. But then immediately just moved this to their *actual* wallet, where I now know that particular user has $447,122.28 (@ $262.93/ETH) worth of Ether.

There were **1000**+ comments in that thread giving out wallet addresses that can then be tied to their usernames.

While hacking someone's MEW wallet may be a more involved process that would take a lot of planning &amp; execution, the second comment I looked at had a username that gave a frequently used wallet with not a lot in it...

However it *did* have details on movements of coins between the Poloniex Wallet address (listed as that on Etherscan), letting me know this person probably has coins on that exchange.

I did a quick dig through their comment history and found they mentioned where they are *from* and a couple of other leads that could result in finding more details on their identity. Since I'm not actually looking to do that I stopped there. But an exchange account is easier to take over, especially if the user doesn't have 2 factor auth enabled. Those accounts are where I'd be looking to focus on in the coming days/weeks if I was a shady fuck who steals peoples ETH.

That was 2 replies to the thread, there were over 1000 the last time I checked. Someone *will* have taken a dump of that thread and will be able to tie those wallets to people. If you added your wallet address there *please* be careful in the future, don't provide ways to tie your post history, personal information and such to your ETH holdings or net worth.
Ensure you've 2 factor auth on your exchange accounts. Ensure you're running a decent anti-virus, don't open documents from unknown or unverified sources, watch out for attempts to engage your reddit account over the next while...be that from helpful souls, hot chicks who are suddenly interested in you etc. etc.

Why do governments reduce demand instead of working to increase supply?,"&gt;You see this in pretty much every macroeconomic decision the government makes… it’s a way to squash or manage demand when in theory you could turn an inflationary economy into a boom by producing more goods, right?

And how is that going to happen? ""Theoretically true"" sometimes means just that.

&gt;Why don’t governments turn to things like business and licensing grants, less strict regulations etc during tough times to stimulate production? 

*Even if* it would be this easy, last time I checked the US had twice as many job openings as unemployed persons. There straight up aren't enough people to perform this increase in work.

Also, I seriously doubt the vast majority of regulations and the like can be loosened to such a great benefit without, for lack of a better word, starting to do stupid shit. They are generally there for a reason, and where there are bad regulations, change tends to be difficult.

&gt;when you’re constantly hearing that the only choices the world economy has right now is hyper inflation or depression.

That's just shitty journalism, or crap people say on the internet. Hyperinflation is literally not even on the table."

Why wasn't there a recession in 1968?,"Your making the assumption that the 2020 pandemic and the social unrest is what caused the current recession, which isn't necessarily true.  The pandemic caused lockdowns which inevitably led to drastic reductions in jobs and spending which certainly fueled the recession, but this [didn't occur in the 1968 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu).  Social unrest, either during 1968 or 2020, likely didn't have any major influence on the economy, so that comparison probably doesn't mean much.  Other economic factors are also at play in terms of the current recession, which shouldn't be ignored, but are maybe outside the scope of this question.

It's worth mentioning that the [United States *did* have a recession in 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), so I'm not even sure your premise is valid.  With that being said, I don't think anyone would blame that recession on the pandemic.  An [estimated 34,000 to 100,000 people died in the US due to the 1968 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu#Mortality).  Considering [COVID surpassed that number back in May](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratedeaths), only a few months in, I'd say this pandemic has had a significantly more drastic impact on the US then the 1968 pandemic did.  So maybe these pandemics are comparable on a global scale, but the 2020 pandemic has been much more brutal on the US vs the 1968 pandemic."
"Kids get this ""stuff""","My middle school son came home &amp; asked me if I knew what a stock was. Just so happened that I had a mutual fund prospectus sitting in the front seat of the car, so I showed it to him. They had a little section on top holdings so I explained how I own shares of this fund and so I own little pieces of all these companies.

He found some he recognized like Microsoft and thought it was so cool that boring old dad owned some of Microsoft. Then without trying to completely give away the bag I told him that he and his brother both had accounts (UGMA) and his brother owned that fund too so he owned some of Microsoft. I could see the wheels turning as he barged in the door exclaiming to his brother ""did he know he owned part of Microsoft??!"". 

It wasn't a huge win but I could definitely see the gears turning."

8 years of investing finally paid off.,"Yes, having my account fluctuate 20k each day due to volatility used to freak me out last year. Now I don’t even feel it. When I made my first 27k in one day I was extremely excited. Though with the market it gave half of it back but as I kept holding the stock continued to climb higher. What we’re in now is compounding growth. Congrats on this feeling may it last as long as possible. At this point now I’m not selling due to tax implications. The more I understand too the more I will continue to invest and only take out what I need. I think that is key. As when you take out just what you need you allow the money to still be invested and that where the real art lies. The art of being able to do nothing is truly a masterful trait. 

One tidbit is Ethereum which wasn’t my 27k day but it is one I semi regret* taking profits while it continues to go up. I didn’t need the money however I did sell it to buy another opportunity but turns out leaving it in Ethereum was the better option. Hindsight is always 20/20 but true wealth is built by holding strong assets. And strong conviction. Cheers the the both of us as it is now swinging our way. 🍻"

Daily Discussion [Serious] - 17/Jun/2017,"I've been here over a year. I remember the days when /u/jtnichol would give us updates of the subscriber count and would post unlisted videos from YouTube and give us all a heart to heart. And of course, what was on the menu for lunch that day. 

He was just one of a motley crew of characters we all knew and loved (/u/Mr_Yukon_C I'm so glad you're a mod now, no one else I think is better for the position), but obviously since ETH is exploding (as all us vets anticipated), a large influx of new subscribers are joining in on the fun. It's become a lot less intimate in here but I guess that is a part of Ethereum becoming what we knew it was destined to be. Bittersweet I suppose....

Anyway, I dig the multiple daily threads. It's a good way to let the community feel itself out as it grows. Little sandboxes people can jump to and from as they please, much in the spirit of crypto itself.

Our exchange student from mexico is now studying engineering at an elite university here in the states.  We also host an Ethiopian who is pre med.  They both had private school educations in high school that were far superior to the public school education here in the states.

Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP),"Other insights for your DD: I haven’t seen any reports on this, but they’re also having a pretty significant exodus of talent. Their pay is terrible, and a lot of their employees could get paid multiples of their current pay at American companies, and this has been exacerbated by the dramatic drop in stock price. This might help to explain why Tobi and the other executives have been trying to pump the stock on Twitter in recent months. I also heard from someone in the know that they dropped the ball on implementing a specific Google-Spotify integration and demanded that Google implement it themselves within an unreasonably short period of time. I think they’re in a tough spot where they’ve been paying too low for years, and now have wage pressures, growing costs, lots of employees leaving, and more difficult financing with the lower stock price."

Too bad that didn’t happen. They are locking us in and the building is on fire.
How different is forex trading compared to stocks trading?,"Forex is WAY harder than trading stocks.

There are a number of reasons for that. First of all, while price manipulation also exists for equities, it is of different nature; in forex, a small number of entities runs algorithms which together possess full price control. This means that the price is constantly moves towards stop accumulations, against DM positions etc. There is a lot of evidence out there proving this.

On top of that, while with stocks you can buy and hold a share, forex is mostly traded on margin, so without an advanced risk management methods, you are doomed.

But yes, FX is more exiting than stocks and more suited to short-term trading. However, make your homework before you go live.

It is a different animal, and a way more hungry one."

I hate my degree,"I went through a similar situation during my undergrad and few years after. Here's how it went for me:


First to second year of College: ""I hate this place, it's full of snobs that only care about money""


Third to last: ""I love economics, it's in the root of every human interaction. I can do everything with this""


[Start working in a bank doing research for (public) investments]
From graduation to three years later: ""I fucking hate this place it's full of people incapable to see the humans behind the numbers""


[Shift to academia and discovered a bunch of other disciplines and their intersection with economics: e.g. Epidemiology, data science, policy analysis.]
Now: ""I like economics, gives me a different perspective to identify relationships and understand the world""


The point is to find what you want to do, what makes you truly passionate, and find a path. The cool thing is that there MANY paths to get to the same place, just have to find yours. Your degree it's just a step in a given path, doesn't have to define your life work."
What is the general consensus on raising the minimum wage to $15 in the United States among economists?,"There is an FAQ entry on this subject: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq\_minwage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage)

&gt;Arindrajit Dube, a prominent minimum wage researcher, has written a [policy proposal](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) on how states and cities should set the minimum wage.  He proposes three main strategies:  
&gt;  
&gt;1: Using 50% of the local area median wage as a starting point for MW  levels.  This would mean that places like San Francisco have a much  higher minimum wage than places like rural Kansas, as wages are much  higher in San Francisco than in Kansas.  
&gt;  
&gt;2: Adjusting minimum wages for local cost-of-living considerations, including indexing increases to a regional CPI.  
&gt;  
&gt;3: Coordinating state and local government strategies to lessen any adverse impact.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dube is careful to note that many of the current minimum wage  proposals are 'out of sample' for current research.  There is a large  body of evidence about the employment impact of small minimum wage  increases - usually little to no employment impact.  For larger  increases in the minimum wage such as a 15MW larger employment effects  are possible, but there historically has not been good data or research  to conclusively show those effects.  With many states undertaking  significant jumps in their minimum wage, that may be changing.

For example according to the policy proposal, half of the median wage would be 8$/hr in Mississippi, but 12.45$/hr in Massachusetts (not accounting for more detailed adjustments)"

4. Health: I’m slimmer and fitter than I’ve been in years, we eat healthily, sleep properly

5. Family: my ageing mums just had an emergency hospital visit and I’ve been able to take a month out to help while she recovers

IV Report - High IV tickers with share price under $50,"This is a good list but there are some in this list that I’d steer clear for a few reasons.

1. NKLA has been hit by Hindenburg Research and their business model is questionable. Quite a risky bet any way you see it.  High IV yes but just a toxic asset in my opinion. 
  
2. Some SPACs like CCIV have great potential but their valuation as it stands now is really aggressive. As rates go up and bond yields go back, many of the SPACs will be hit. You’re already seeing a correction.  So good in the near term but I personally think IV crush may happen in the next quarter or so. 
  
3. Some of the cannabis stocks are meme stocks- SNDL, APH etc. Obviously the industry is likely to grow but I’d argue the market has already priced that in for many of these. But some of the premiums are absurd on those. 
  
4. Other meme stocks like BB are propped up on demand that I don’t think represents underlying value. Predicting a volatility contraction with this would be near impossible IMO."
Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold,"Real talk, believed in the ""GME has actual value,"" DD, covered my cost basis on the way up, also sit here with 100 shares.

Where does the volume come from? To your point, if we thought GME had value before, what changed?

What's so attractive with real estate?,"Real estate is the greatest wealth creator aside from an operating business.  It isn’t about the appreciation or the cash flows, which are both substandard; it’s about the deferred taxation on debt pay down.  Sometimes it’s never taxed if you use the buy, borrow, die approach.

Top 10% control 88% stock holdings as of Sept 2019. Values are high flying during pandemic while the world plunges into chaos. Do you ever feel guilty?,"The top 10% owning 88% of stocks is a misleading figure, so if you take it at face value, I can understand why you feel guilty. But it's pretty misguided. 

The reality is that the top 1% own over half of the equities in the country. That's 1% of people owning 56% of the stocks. The following top 9% hold 32% of the stocks. Then the following 90% of people own 12% of the stocks. 

For context, earning about $160k per year is around the threshold of making it into the top 10% and $300k per year almost puts you into the top 5%

I personally think the top 1% of people owning MORE THAN HALF of the stocks is a bigger problem than the other top 9% that own a third of the stocks."

I have about $70k of debt from my training/education and I just got hired and will be receiving a $44k signing bonus.

I’ve had some jobs not offer it to me until I met some terms such as stay X amount of years with the company. Or if you leave before X years, you have to pay that signing bonus back. Most sign-on bonuses are going to be taxed, so I would expect to lose some of that amount due to taxes. I would go straight to paying off the credit card debt after those terms are figured out !

After five months, I told them to fix it or I was taking my business elsewhere.  I also got both charges refunded that month.  And after six months, I changed banks.

Do economists think that poverty is behavioral or do they think that it is structural/political in nature?,"It's not like ""behavioural"" factors play no role at all, but others matter far more.

Prime example, China used to be a very poor country in the 80's and 90's. Do you think people just kinda ""changed their mind""? No, China had big economic reforms in the 70's, and once they really got going, the economy started to grow and people got out of poverty.

Of course being poor in the US today is different than being poor in 89's China. The point is that you need the *ability* to thrive. That goes from ""big"" factors like availability of decent jobs, a stable government and robust and inclusive institutions to smaller ones like access to schools, having your basic needs met, having decent healthcare, etc. But also your neighborhood, your city, your race, etc.

And yes, welfare programs do help to lift people out of poverty.

https://www.cbpp.org/social-security-lifts-15-million-children-out-of-poverty

(Obviously, not every welfare program is equally effective.)

From a plain perspective, relatively comparable countries in Europe don't necessarily have less poverty despite their bigger welfare state.

https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/5313/1/MPRA_paper_5313.pdf

On the other hand, more extensive welfare is a good candidate to reduce poverty in the US. We see exactly that happening with the expansion of Medicaid for example.

Inflation a lie?,"Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level.

That's it. Does the price level go up? Then you have inflation.

Doesn't matter if that happens because producer prices go up thanks to supply shortages or because someone's wish from a genie is for prices to go up, inflation is very much real completely independent of the cause.

Obviously corporate greed is not the whole story, companies always want to earn as much as they can, they don't just *decide* to be more greedy, something *enables* them to charge higher prices. That doesn't mean companies don't earn higher profits and that this is part of the reason for higher inflation."
"How come scientists can build algorithms for chess etc and beat the human, but there hasn’t been a super successful algo for day trading yet?","The comments here seem to focus on the fact that chess is a game of perfect information while markets are not. This is certainly one of the components, but I think it misses something more significant.

Scientists **can** build successful algos for day trading. They already have numerous times. The challenge is that there is also someone on the other side creating their own versions that are faster/are more accurate/generate better signals. The analogy isn't machine vs. human; it's human creating a machine vs. many other humans creating their own competing machines.

We see similar dynamics today in chess between Stockfish and Alpha Zero. The fact that chess is a game of perfect information is not that relevant. Developers who build trading strategies professionally **know** they can beat humans. They are more interested in beating the developer working on a similar strategy next door."

"How I Wasted $117,000 in 6 Months.","I read that whole post, and I have good news.

She got a job making $5 an hour and ended up working her way up to a better job eventually, she now works at a grocery store. I think she is a manager now, nothing super fancy.

She never made much money, and she isn't completely frugal. She has 2 properties in the part of minnesota where all the billionaires live. Shes about to get a third. She isn't a genius, she didn't have help, she never had any skill. She just literally went to work and tried to not be wasteful, that's it. Now she is set, and has zero worries. It's actually insane to me because I saw the whole thing happen step by step.

I'm 34, and 3 months ago had nothing but a car and a laptop. In 3 months of effort, I went from pretty much every single metric telling me that success was impossible, to pretty much every metric saying that unless I just die, it's impossible for me to fail.

[Edit: get another offer, that is.   Then you know what you are worth.   Ask for what you want from your present employer.  You don't even have to say you have another offer if you don't want to.  But you have leverage and options with the new offer that you don't without it.]"
Could/would Goldfinger's plan have succeeded?,"I think this is more a science question, not an economic question. If you irradiated gold, it’s like trying to irradiate lead from my understanding. You can’t do it. You might contaminate the outside but you can just clean it. Let Lead and gold are natural shielding from radioactive material so as soon as you got the particulates off of it, it shouldn’t be radioactive. I suppose if you got the core temperature of the gold to melt and then impart a tiny radioactive particles in the liquid gold then the cost to decontaminate would go up dramatically but just a bomb with radioactive material wouldn’t be too difficult to clean up."
"I bet there’s a huge majority of you out there, across the world, who are mostly silent on here, quietly hodling your GME and are completely impervious by any news (good or bad), any dramas within this or other subs, the DDs, the SEC rules, GameStop hires, lights on at 3am.","Hear hear. Been in this game for months. Went from r/WSB, then r/GME, now r/Superstonk.  I'm used to reading differing opinions, good DD, bad DD, good predictions, bad predictions but nothing has changed in the grand total scheme of things for me.

I appreciate all opinions, theories and insights that people provide us and discuss amongst each other, no matter how conservative or how crazy. I don't need constant reassurance and confirmation bias to keep doing what I've been doing all the time, which is holding my shares.

Just chill. Someone has to be chilling because the shorts sure as hell aren't chilling. Citadel and co. are the ones that are supposed to go crazy, paranoid. Not us."
UPI is a great boon for the poor and middle-class Indian alike but it still needs some improvement,"First they need to make UPI reliable before thinking about doing away with debit cards. The failure rate of UPI is ridiculous which shows the existing banking infrastructure in very poor light. Clearly, the system can only handle batch transactions and not real time transactions with high reliability. Imagine going to the ATM to withdraw cash and UPI is failing repeatedly. It's not like going to another ATM is gonna fix that problem.

I like the idea of moving away from debit card based authentication for UPI. Developed countries have moved on to TOTP based 2FA using Google Authenticator or Authy. Why can't Indian banks do the same? I would like to use Authy 2FA for all bank transactions including UPI instead of sms based OTP which is not very secure and prone to SIM swap attacks."
Clinton Economic Plan Megathread,"&gt; Her plan would put forward a tax credit for businesses of $1,500 per apprentice and would insist on accountability for employment and earnings outcomes for programs receiving the credit. 

One of the concerns I've read about on r/politics is that people think apprentices would replace fully-paid workers. Since the US don't have the kind of century-old structures that other countries with strong apprenticeship systems do, doesn't this 1500 thing add an extra incentive to ""trick the system"" and replace a fully-paid position with SS &amp; health insurance and whatnot?

GME Endgame,"I was never rich, worked my ass working as a dishwasher while doing masters at school as an immigrant. Could only work for 18-20 hours per week at $6.75 per hour because of immigration rules. I had to take a loan even to pay the flight ticket to USA.

After 10+ years on H1b visa and no end on sight for a greencard this is looking like a light at the end of the tunnel.

I don't even have any dreams left after years of slogging, but I hope this changes things.

My company is offering me 15 weeks pay to leave,"Having been in sales most of my career, if you are feeling burned out it is 100% showing to the people around you.  

Couple things, 1) a buyout is going to be 100x easier to explain to the next potential employer than being fired. 2) the 4 months health insurance is a huge offer and worth probably $1000/month or more for family coverage.  

Take the buyout, file unemployment, focus on finding something either in sales closer to the IT field, or figure out how to get something that will lead to programming job.  

From being in sales, your $40k with 55-60 total income is about what most entry level sales pays, so you shouldn’t be out long if you have a proven, documentable history of meeting sales targets before the virus."

Married Rich - Lost Sense of Value / Purpose,"This will be a problem if you only find your self worth through a number.  That being said, you can take an alternative route to success here, and actually still contribute to wealth generation.  Use the funds to start, manage and grow a successful business you have expertise in.  You will find fulfillment in job creation and wealth creation, beyond the inheritance.  In other words, take your starting point and grow it in more ways than just the bottom line.  Find value there.  And unless we are talking billionaire levels of inheritance, you can still grow wealth materially and make a difference, assuming that is in fact important to you."
Chamath Palihapitiya was just on CNBC trying to explain our current situation,"That was hands down one of the most engaging discussions Ive ever seen on CNBC.  That was awesome that they shifted over to going into a long format discussion so we could watch two talented people engage each other like that.  
I hope someone captured it so it can be seen again later.   

Chamath's point is really lost on CNBC because here we are 30 minutes later and they have this *secretary of the commonwealth Massachusetts* on saying we need regulation to protect the retail investor from themselves and the market as a whole from the retail investor.

I want to live off dividends.,"Invest in growth stocks for the next nine years until your 35 and then start putting your money in value dividend stocks.

Why do so many people get excited over tax refunds when it is basically an interest free loan to the government?,"A large tax refund is more money than many people have in their bank accounts at any given moment. It is money they get at once to spend. If they had a higher deduction and got the money earlier, they would have spent it on something small and would not have the money to make a larger purchase. For some, paying extra money in taxes is like having the government be their piggy bank of sorts. 


You are right. It is best to be financially prudent, save money well, and optimize deductions. Unfortunately, very few Americans are financially prudent. Most spend too much. Most save too little. And most don't have adequate savings to retire at a reasonable age. Paying too much in taxes is not optimal. It is not quite as bad as failing to save 15% or more of your income towards retirement, but optimally your tax refund or additional tax liability would be minimal when you do taxes. "
I need to make 5k in 14 months,"Start selling stuff on eBay. I started about two years ago and it ended up becoming my full time job. Just find cheap stuff from your local retail store (Walmart, etc) and start listing it on eBay. Don't forget to use an 'eBay calculator' for the US to see if it's worth listing some items. Over a 1 year period you should be able to make $5k. Good luck

"Learning is Cool ($350k invested / $13,470yr Income)","Thank you for sharing your experience, this is really encouraging! I love dividend investing... it's a no-brainer for me. Money that makes more money by doing the easiest thing in the world (holding)? Count me in. Honestly, buying dividend stocks is helping me save money in the short term, and long term, to be honest... because all I feel like doing when I have extra cash is increasing my positions."
Why is it that millenials are poorer than boomers were at the same age/is the millenial quality of life worse than the boomers?,"There are three important aspects to this:
1. Objectively, the quality of life is probably better because we have a lot more advanced products, and the same products boomers used to have are now cheaper. 

2. The above is not true for real estate as the amount of land in good locations and what we consider good locations are both finite and limited. As the number of people increase faster than good housing, real estate becomes more expensive.

3. We know from behavioural economics that people’s perceived wellbeing and wealth does not depend on objective levels but in relation to others. Boomers lived much better than their parents, and in relative terms they felt that they are in a better place, both in temporal sense (we live better than our parents) and in cross section (the middle class was bigger and there was less wealth inequality). However, what is middle class now (large screen TVs, two cars, airconditioning, computers, mobile phones, etc) would be upper class or simply wasn’t available to boomers when they were young. 


So objectively, a middle class person can probably afford more stuff and less real estate than boomers, and in relative terms a millennial middle class person doesn’t feel to be in such a good position as boomers felt they were."
How much do doctors actually make?,"People are throwing around some idealistically high end medical salaries ITT (typical salary of GP 300K/year? Hilarious - my GP colleagues wish this was the case!).

First of all - medicine is still a well-renumerated job, yes.  Excellent job security - also yes.

However please keep in mind that there is a good reason why a large majority of doctors (a) regret going into medicine, and (b) tell their children to do something else.

Mostly - lifestyle and length of training.  The money, whilst decent, just doesn't seem worth it to a lot of people once you factor in how miserable medical training can be, and the sacrifices it demands.  And this misery continues anywhere from \~8-15 years after you **finish** medical school, depending on which specialty you aspire to.  As others have pointed out - there are FAR easier ways to make a lot of money.

Firstly, the length of training.  To become a doctor in Australia these days (especially now that undergraduate medicine is becoming less and less common) you're looking at 7-8 years of university (3-4 years of undergrad + 4 years of medical school).

Wow 8 years of university.  That's tough going huh.  Oh my sweet summer children - that's the easy part.  When you graduate from medical school the pain is really just beginning.

It's not so bad if you know you want to be a GP - you can qualify as a fully fledged GP consultant 4 years out of medical school (2 years in hospital + 2 years of GP registrar training).   GP salary depends a lot on location, and the type of GP work you do.  City non procedural GPs don't make amazing money - 150-250K/year.  Procedural GPs make more - could probably clear close to 300K if you're in the city and work full time.  The biggest money is in rural procedural - they can easily make 400K+ a year.  But that job is fucking stressful - you are dealing with a hugely comorbid population far from the support of major metropolitan centres.  As a rural GP you're often also running the local ED and doing a lot of on call.  Don't underestimate the stress of that.  Btw somebody mentioned 700K for a rural procedural GP - that person would have to be a practice owner in the middle of fucking nowhere just doing 50 skin cancer excisions a day - that level of earning as a GP is INCREDIBLY rare.  If it was easy to earn that much as a GP, everybody would do it.

Edit: GPs are also the politicians whipping boys.  Politicians LOVE to cut medicare funding for GPs off at the knees - expecting them to do more and more with less and less, whipping up negative sentiments in the public about ""greedy GPs"" who are charging higher and higher gaps to their patients (well yeah, what on earth do you expect when medicare billings for GPs have been stagnant for ages + you keep removing the items they can charge for).  Having said that some of my happiest colleagues are those in GP land - but yeah, it comes with its own challenges it seems.

Want to be a physician? (think: cardiologist, gastroenterologist, respiratory doctor haematologist, paediatrician etc) you're looking at at least 8 years training post medical school. (1 year intern plus 1 year resident + 3 years BPT plus 3+ years advanced training then add fellowships, which seem to be becoming more and more compulsory).  The hours depend on subspecialty but you'll easily work 60+, with a lot of time outside of work spent studying / preparing for exams etc.  You'll also spend your best years working nights, weekends, public holidays.  Money isn't terrible as a consultant physician - 200-400K/year if you're public.  You can earn more in private practice, esp if you're in a procedural specialty like gastro or interventional cardiology.  It's a little lower in paediatric specialties compared to adult physician specialties.

Surgery? Now here is where the purest pain lies (and incidentally - the source of all my bitterness haha).  1 year intern plus 1-2 years as a resident typically then anywhere from \~3 to infinity years as an unaccredited registrar (this is where you work in your specialty of choice but aren't actually officially on a training program yet - all surgical specialties make you do this), then (if and when you ever get into your surgical training program of choice, and it's highly likely you never will) another 5+ years as a training reg.  So you're looking at anywhere from 10-15 years post finishing medical school before you're a surgical consultant these days, unless you are some combination of lucky / gifted / well connected.

During all that time as a surgical registrar/PHO you're making okay money (between 110K-150K / year) but, depending on specialty, they can be miserable years.  Nights, weekends, public holidays.  Spending thousands a year on exam prep.   Working 70-120 hours/week depending on specialty.  During your years as an unaccredited registrar you're also spending all your spare time (haha what spare time?) publishing garbage low quality research, doing Masters and PhDs, trying desperately not to piss anyone off and smiling through the systemic abuse so that Senpai RACS (or RANZCO, or RANZCOG) will notice you and let you onto the program.  I managed 7 months as a surgical subspecialty PHO before I saw the writing on the wall and resigned.  My accredited registrar was PGY-12 before he got onto the training program.  That's 12 years as a doctor, and he has another five to go before he's a consultant.  No thanks.

If you are the special type of person who manages to make it through the surgery hellfire (mostly high functioning sociopaths these days as the emotionally normal people tend to self select out, although there are exceptions and some truly lovely individuals do exist in surgery) you're going to make a lot of money - private surgeons in particular can easily clear a million a year.

Psychiatry is a good lifestyle choice - you can be a fully fledged consultant psychiatrist within 6-7 years of finishing medical school and they can clear 400-600K publicly and even more privately.  It's extremely well renumerated - this is mostly due to high demand, low supply.

I'm not as familiar with the critical care specialties like ED, anaesthetics, ICU.  ED is oversupplied however so difficult to get FTE boss jobs - also you'll do shift work forever.  ICU - my god the training is gruelling, it goes forever and is academically incredibly rigorous, oh and there are no jobs.  Anaesthetics is a pretty good gig especially if you can score a sweet private job doing high throughout lists like scopes, cataracts etc - you can clear a million a year no problem.  Competitive entry though.

If you go through my post history you can read more ranting and raving about what I dislike about medicine and how a mere seven months as a PHO in a surgical subspecialty traumatised me - I'm prone to histrionics on the topic so forgive me for that.

I'm still glad I'm a doctor though and I don't regret it - I find it rewarding, the job security is fantastic and it's well renumerated.  But there's a huge cost.  I spent a lot of time at university, I miss a lot of time with my young family that I know I'll never get back (that's the hardest one), I have been driven close to suicide by the emotional and physical demands of the job before in terms of the hours and stress (I'm okay now that I've left surgery), I spend a lot of my time outside of work studying and doing post-graduate courses etc.  There are easier ways to make this level of money."
[ETH Daily Discussion] - 25/May/2017,"Hi Everyone! Hope you are doing well and enjoying breaking 200 USD. There has been a ton of excitement, which might just be a taste of what is to come. Recently I have seen questions about coins, and although our community is quick with basic information and eager recommendations. I wanted to take a second to break down common coins and projects discussed on r/ethtrader. I’ll try to stay objective, but there is some personal opinion because this is about trading, not just tech. Constructive feedback is more than appreciated and I encourage anyone to continue this list; it is not definitive and I am certainly no expert.

#**Golem**

* **Subreddit:** r/GolemProject
* **Current Marketcap:** $410,196,473
* **Current Price:** $0.497285 (-2.07%)
* **Brief:** *From the Company -* Golem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It's made up of the combined power of user's machines, from personal laptops to entire data centers. Anyone will be able to use Golem to compute (almost) any program you can think of, from rendering to research to running websites, in a completely decentralized &amp; inexpensive way. The Golem Network is a decentralized sharing economy of computing power, where anyone can make money 'renting' out their computing power or developing &amp; selling software. 
Their most current [whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf) projects their first release of the product, Clay Golem, in Q2 2017. That’s now in case you didn’t know and [github reports that it is 68% complete and on track for a May 31st release.]( https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/milestone/11) 
* **Trader Hot Take:** The value of cloud computing can be debated, it is a growing market, but by how much? I have read predictions for [$390 Billion by 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/02/11/global-cloud-spending-predicted-to-reach-390b-by-2020/#6b8bcc9e1085) and some much, much bolder predictions on the Golem subreddit. With any luck Golem will be taking a slice of that pie, but the speculation is how much and how do they get it. Right now the Clay release aims to tackle computer rendering through cloud sharing, which seems like all awful small part of the market compared with other services like data storage. Although everyone has tremendous things to say about the intuition and skill of the development team, I think the value of this coin depends on finding then capitalizing on the right applications of cloud computing.

+ **Brief:** [Augur is a fully open-source and decentralized prediction market platform.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yegyih591Jo) 
+ **Trader Hot Take:** Augur reports that they should launch [late summer 2017.](http://blog.augur.net/faq-frequently-asked-questions/) followed quickly by a bug bounty. If it goes smoothly, expect things to happen. I believe that not only does this company stand to make profits off users, but also the data that comes from group behavior. Big data is an invaluable resource – companies salivate over this kind of stuff. Platform use is incentivized for the user base, so I hope for it to catch on and become successful. Not just that but I like CEO Jack Peterson’s [travel blog](http://travelmag.co.uk/2012/11/tangled-by-mandarin-on-a-love-ship-tour-of-taiwan/), gotta love a good blog.

Also, with the potential to provide a platform for information sales. [Whitepaper for everything and more](https://gnosis.pm/resources/default/pdf/gnosis_whitepaper.pdf)
+ **Trader Hot Take:** I could not find information about a potential launch date for Gnosis, that may hurt their cause if someone beats them to market. However, with the backing of big names, there is a lot of buzz. GNOs market cap is almost identical to Augur’s and if they are competing, it will come down to who has the better development team. Investors should do their due diligence on both companies and then decide who to invest in. Maybe its both 


#**Iconomi**

[Financial Report and Whitepaper](https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-financial-report-q1-2017-a1b9dff59e2c) 
+ **Trader Hot Take:** Important disclaimer. ICN is the ICO which was a direct investment in ICONOMI. It will not be a DAA, but the coin will be ‘burnt’ which means it will be re-purchased then removed from circulation. This is a way of profit sharing to paying back initial investors with higher coin prices. I have seen posts here criticizing this move because it puts too much faith in the company, they are under no legal obligation to burn these coins. Their later release of ICNX will be tied to a DAA with their digital portfolio. 
With the PRISM released this week, a lot of people started comparing ICONOMI to this. I think this idea holds potential, maybe it’s the start of mutual funds or ETFs for crypto. However, they need to prove why they are smarter investors than the average wallet hodler.

Aragon is everything you need to run your company on Ethereum. Cap table, governance, fundraising, payroll, accounting, bylaws. Aragon organizations will be able to be seamlessly upgraded and solve human disputes using a decentralized court system. [Whitepaper at github](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/blob/master/Aragon%20Whitepaper.pdf)
+ **Trader Hot Take:** With the ANT sale happening just last week, I will not pretend like I understand anything about this project. But as we go deeper down a crypto rabbit hole, I can imagine a use for decentralized organizations and arbitration. How the value of this coin and company relates, determine for yourself.

+ **Trader Hot Take:** If you are a gamer, this has gotta make you excited. This could revolutionize competitive and even recreational play for just about any game. As an idea, I could see this working for PCs and I wonder if it could even make its way to consoles. Witnesses and Jury systems make the payment process a little complicated, but I really like the Global Ranking and Reputation features. Whether or when First Blood gets adopted determines the price of this coin in my opinion.

A decentralized hedge fund with lower limits for entering, reduced overhead costs, and more transparent operations. It is not predicted to launch until February 2018, so at this point it is all speculation in my opinion. "
Still on the fence about passive investing? This one's for you,"I started investing about 5 years back with Franklin India Bluechip Fund. This has the mythical status of being a great fund behind a sound AMC with amazing ethics. (Ha, we all know how that turned out.)

I also had Quantum Long Term Equity, which promised supposed downside protection. But damn, its upside capture was woeful. But kudos to them for sticking to their value based investing theory. Its just not for me.

And then PPLTE, but just as I started its star fund manager met his unfortunate death and I went conservative, interestingly the fund played well (despite Noida Toll Bridge and other questionable picks). 

The point is, I was in a way picking the subjective winners of the day, the ones I picked lost and the one I didnt did well. 

Over the last year, I had enough of all this and simply switched over to Index funds. During the crash, I pulled out money from Franklin, QLTEV units which did not incur short term gains and moved them to index funds. I still have PPLTE but thats small. I missed the chance of putting in more money, somehow I couldnt bring myself to add more during the crash, and only shifted from one fund to another but I am happy I did.

Index funds are good enough for someone like me who has a day job and has a good chance of growing at a much higher rate at my job that the market that I dont need to take other market related risks. Just some real return there would be enough for me."
Franklin Templeton top execs withdrew crores from the wound up fund just before they were locked to the public.,"FT shit the bed so bad in this saga.

I personally don't have any money stuck, exited UST before they locked it down. But I am still angry at these dalal street cowboys"
Finally got the big girl job,"Highish COL but not NYC or Bay area and in Faang...welcome to Seattle!

More to the point, at your level, I'd start by reading about person finance and educate yourself before hiring help. You are not yet super high income or networth from the sound of it, so they are only really going to add value if you know enough background to ask good questions."
Change my mind: Rolling out is just sunk cost fallacy,"Options industry professional here, 10+ years experience.  

Rolling is indeed just trying again with a new trade.  There is a fallacy at work with rolling, but generally it is an *anchoring* fallacy at play more than a *sunk cost* fallacy.  Regardless, if someone initiates a trade via rolling that they would NOT have entered without the original position, they are behaving irrationally.

One important functional part, however, is that rolling can allow you to stay with a given thesis but avoid assignment if the position happens to be against you at the moment.  And that can be big when an assignment would tie up a lot of your capital/margin.

I work on the institutional side; the big boys do plenty of rolling of their positions.  It's not just a noob thing."

Property considerations should be on the backburner until this is a lot more stable, and there's some consensus on money, because the resentment here will only build."

Question about dividend investing,"Growth can be faked. Yields can’t. 

I know there’s a strong argument to make against this thinking but having lived through the Enron, 08 and now the 22 crashes where companies were trading wildly above their actual values, it’s nice seeing a company prove they can turn a profit by distributing the money to owners.

That and say I buy 2 stocks at $100ea. Stock A grows to $105, stock B grows to $101 but pays me $3. I get $105 if I sell A and that’s the end of that. I get $3 plus I still get the benefits of continued growth of not selling stock B.

Money isn’t money to me until I can use it to buy whiskey and lap dances with it. Hypothetical value isn’t as much important to me"

GameStop is planning on DPO'ing GME-E onto blockchain exchange. Cohen's tweets deciphered. GG.,"When I first heard about the theory that they were going to move GME to blockchain and off the NYSE I thought no way. But this is exactly what I think RC’s move is. In reality he can do whatever the fuck he wants with the stock. It’s the companies decision. If they build their own framework to do it their is essentially zero risk and only upside. He can’t be accused of any sort of market manipulation because his answer would be “it’s our stock and we decided to move it to blockchain, an unexpected side effect was exposing millions of synthetic shares, O well!”

This could be world changing….especially if other “meme stocks” hop on board."
European Financial News is Reporting Major MARGIN CALLS are Already Happening on Wall Street... and the Feds Have Quietly Issued Billions in Emergency Bail Out Loans to Financial Institutions Over the Past Two Days,"If it were you, small time investor, your shit would have been called and your stock sold underneath you.  Except it wouldn't have actually been sold, but transferred and you'd still be liable to make up any difference.  

If you were a family office called Archegos, certain firms which held your notes would have quietly liquidated in order to keep the prices up.  No fire sale there.  Of course those firms which hold the notes won't lose a dime.  And the family office?  8-bells and all's well.  

Now that those larger institutions that lend to us little fish have a little bit of risk - the Government steps on in with an emergency payday loan.  I don't care if it's 24 hrs or 24 days.  We can't get that but OUR Government will bail out these folks who are experts (aka GoDs) in the financial field ... but not tell us what is happening with OUR tax dollars?

This is wrong on so many level.  The experts should know better and be treated not with kid gloves, but like the market-makers they are.  They know how to make money, move markets and to protect themselves.

The Government should be there to protect the individual, not the largest of the large who can afford to take it on the chin."

How I turned $54k into $400K+ in 8 Months. Deal Analysis of my Mobile Home Park,"I don’t understand most of this, but good work. Trailer parks are good if you do them right. Too many people want to get into high-dollar real estate when high volume, low cost can be more profitable. You do have to take more risks on low-income tenants, but repairs are usually cheaper, and most fixes don’t have to be high-end professionals. My boss has 1-2 guys working on 40 mobile homes everyday. Pays 52k salary to one guy, 15-20 an hour to the other. He just sits back and rakes in cash while working his other job. 

Properties don’t sit vacant either. Cheap housing goes fast, especially if you’re known for operating fairly."

Someone used my credit card and ordered two 256gb iPhone X's to my house.,"I've never had an actual package arrive, but my credit card was compromised last month and had multiple purchases for AT&amp;T service accounts and equipment.

If I were you, I would let your credit card know that a physical package arrived and also get in touch with the company that send the items. You'll want to figure out what there process is for reclaiming goods from the vendor and get proof that those phones made it back to them when the time comes.

Model Tenancy Act Approved To Unlock Vacant Houses For Rental Purposes,"I know it's obvious but many people don't know so I want to clear something up.

Majority of people who live on rent are on a ""Leave and License"" agreement basis, which establishes a relationship of Licensor and Licensee. It's basically a license to live in the premises and the owner leaves the premise.

On the other hand there are ""Lease Deeds"" which establish a Tenant and Landlord relationship, in which the Tenant has a lot of legal rights.

Truth about successful algo traders. They dont exist,"I was an independent algotrader for a couple of years after being a researcher in an institutional prop desk for a couple of years, risk management, also a couple of years, portfolio manager , another couple of years (actually it wasn’t a couple, I’ve been in it for 15 years now). As an independent ago trader I devised 3 or 4 algos that were profitable for 3-6 months (one after other) and managed money for some friends on 2/20 scheme. I blew up one account (mine) and one of my friend’s account which was an awful experience. I don’t have the secret sauce. I have a process: research, devise the algo, backtest, paper test, go live and spend most of the time doing risk management/ researching the next algo. Now , I work as quant Portfolio manager for a small franchise of asset managers with 100 million AUM and a decent 6 figure income. So, this is my piece of mind: No tech indicator/strategy works further than a couple of months and most of those strategies work for a while due to overfitting , you must stay alive to fight the next battle (risk management IS THE SECRET SAUCE) and managing money for your friends starts as a sweet dream and becomes a nightmare after the first round of losses which eventually come. I think I can tell you what NOT TO DO: Don’t put all your capital on one internet devised strategy, don’t manage money for friends and family, and don’t get specialized in one asset , to remain long enough to earn a living from this you should know all of the assets and the economics and finance behind them, so you can diversify, change markets when needed.... and why I’m writing this here? I also teach CS in a university and love teaching. And have a course on algotrading online (which pays for summer vacations or Christmas presents) so I like to know the struggles and needs of people trying to do this  so I can cover  them on my courses and drop a bit of advise every once in a while....

$FB - why shouldn't I be backing up the truck?,"* Everyone hates them as a company, they've alienated their original userbase of facebook, and there isn't a great reason to believe that they won't alienate their remaining cash cow on instagram. Increasingly broad public views that social media is toxic is a leading indicator of future adoption and growth.
* They are facing increasing regulatory and antitrust scrutiny, which means they won't be able to just buy another instagram in the future. Additionally, they will face risk from potential antitrust drums, which are now beating from both sides of the political aisle. Even without idea of breakup, additional fines and laws have been a thorn in their side.
* Metaverse has no prospective path to profitability right now, and is more of a buzzword than an actual thing. VR will clearly have a lot of applications, many niche, but building an entire actual metaverse ignores a massive amount of roadblocks to doing so.
* Social media adoption growth has likely peaked globally, making Facebook more of a mature company who has to deal with competitors without the ability to buy those competitors. Not a good place to be on a long term perspective when you have a lot of customers who only use your product because there is not a good alternative.
* Network effects work both ways. They're very defensible and cause lots of people to hop on board so long as a product is popular and growing. But the same is also true in the opposite sense - when people are jumping offboard, the value proposition that comes from a network that nobody uses or has low social value can cause things to really crash fast. I think this is a bigger risk than people realize, and it's something that I don't think I've ever seen discussed online.
* Apple's privacy changes were a gamechanger from an advertiser perspective (I work in advertising) and lots of people have been pulling ad budget away from Facebook due to not being able to target in such a focused manner. Facebook's previous targeting was far better than what you would get on other ad platforms online, which is part of why it was very popular. I think we will start to see more than just apple products implementing these privacy policies in the future, which should cause further reduction in ad spending."

Blackrock just rang the alarm on CNBC regarding the impending market crash!!,"You can tell he's trying to warn people without overtly saying it.

TikTok has opened my eyes to how many “personal finance gurus” are out there providing awful long term advice,"The simple truth *so many people* won’t accept is that despite the absurdly huge important of proper financial planning for one’s future, it’s stupid simple.  I mean just incredibly, incredibly easy.  Making the money is the hard part.  What to do with it when you have it is the simple part.

The issue is that this simplicity just doesn’t *feel* right to people.  Being secure in retirement by putting in a few hours a year?  Just seems wrong, right?  Surely time and effort = results.

But no, not in this case.  And that is where the opportunities lie for people willing to give bad advice.  Inadvertently or purposefully.

Because a video spelling out basic Boglehead style principles doesn’t need much.  You can get up to speed in a day.  But an advisor who proclaims active energy is constantly needed?  That can hook you for years.

I won’t deny that money into a business can generate a better ROI.  I’m a business owner.  But if you have a good job with a 401k and have no desire to quit that job and run a business, literally all you need is to read the boglehead wiki and book or two, put your investing on autopilot, and retire in comfort in a few decades."
Would the economy be better off if we had not addressed covid-19 and let the virus run rampant?,"That's a pretty big hypothetical... And virtually no one could really say with any degree of certainty.

My 2¢ is go look at Sweden and use that as a measuring stick economically for what would happen as they went the herd immunity route originally (I think they've changed since), is there economy better for unaffected? IDK ,  probably not.

Second if you let it run rampant, with even greater death tolls on the. Nightly  news people would be even more fearful and still not engage in social activities especially hospitality businesses like restaurants,,  cruises, hotels etc.. they would suffer similar degree of economic hardship. Also companies out of fear of litigation would probably ask those workers that could work remotely to do so
..so that would be the same... Most folks working remotely so lot less commuting so all travel related economics, air travel, oil , autos etc.. would also be affected economically similar to the way they are now.

Finally as far as the old folks dying and passing on their inheritance, it wouldn't do much since that wouldn't really change the spending habits during the pandemic, plus not all folks passing away are that old many are still in their 50,60s, and  I don't think their inheritance would be a significant factor in the economy relative to the loss in activity.

I think a. Ig difference in this pandemic is how much media coverage it's gotten and how aggressive all governments have been about trying to control the spread.."
Why don't developing countries like India just replace the rupee with the dollar and set Us prices for everything from Petrol and Snacks to Minimum Wage Daily Labourers to salaries of CEOs on big firms?,"What you are referring to is known as [currency substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_substitution), or more specifically - dollarization. There are a number of reasons why this would not be an optimal approach to solving wealth inequalities between countries, here are the main ones:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Maintaining control of your own currency allows you to exert direct influence on the economy by setting interest rates, engaging in quantitative easing, and to some extent impacting exchange rates. This is [discretionary monetary policy](https://pocketsense.com/discretionary-monetary-policy-6973567.html). By using the USD, the Indian government would be ceding that control to the US government. The Indian government has no power to print the USD, so the only way it could attain more is through maintaining a trade surplus with countries that primarily use the USD. Without enough exports to these trade partners, the supply of USD may fail to match the demand leading to a lack of liquidity and deflation. This is the opposite of what you envision. Without commenting on Indian politics, it seems as though India has managed to implement discretionary monetary policy [somewhat successfully](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap31g.pdf).
2. Having your own currency is a form of competition. While the INR has devalued considerably [over the last 10 years](https://getmoneyrich.com/strength-of-currency/#INR-USD-Exchange-Rate), the weaker INR actually boosts export profitability and increases domestic demand, spurring economic activity and growth.

&amp;#x200B;

Currency substitution doesn't always work out. Take a look at the EU as a prime case. Southern, Central, and Eastern European countries have been severely affected by fiscal crises and currency devaluation. The implementation of the Euro has led to a [divergence in income equality](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/dp008_en.pdf) between these member states and richer ones such as Germany, the UK, France etc. In these states, costs have dramatically increased and [locals have been forced to emigrate](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13608746.2017.1413051) in the hopes they can earn enough money abroad to survive."
Motley Fool Uncovered &amp; in Damage Control,"How has the SEC allowed them to control a narrative in an extremely popular financial media outlet and run an asset management company at the same time? That’s the definition of criminal manipulation. 

Ridiculous conflict of interest."
How does old money stay wealthy?,"Much of Europe has a social system that reinforces (and even enforces) social and financial hierarchy stability. The true old wealth in Europe (that has survived, remember “survivorship bias”) has had the advantage of laws and traditions that tips the scales in their favor. For all of the complaining about the American system, the social and financial boundaries between classes are far more fluid. 

Also, and you can’t overemphasis this: survivorship bias is at play here in your assessment."

I think I figured out what is causing the delisted stocks to spike.,I think it's likely some of the toxic portfolio swaps imploding on themselves. I remember reading DD on the lenders required HFs to hedge their long positions with a set of predetermined short baskets. I think a bunch of smaller HFs were forced into hedging their longs with these baskets and they're slowly popping off all around the market. Just wait till the bank vault of shorts pops open.
Why are so many businesses only open 9-5 in Australia?,"There are laws that restrict certain types of businesses from opening outside certain hours - State-based, so I can’t point you to a centralised list, but for example my local Woolworths is the only one in Brisbane open 24 hours because it’s on federal (airport) land so different laws apply. These laws have certainly been relaxing over the decades.

Then there’s our Employment Award system. Australia is an expensive country, and a big part of that is high wages that flow through for any service business. I’m not saying wages should be lower, merely that anything outside ‘normal’ hours starts incurring penalty rates and/or overtime multiples ... and it’s hard to make a profit as a newsagent if you’re paying staff $40+/hour (hypothetical rate) plus all the other costs of being open. And that’s before factoring in unions that (rightly, imho) fight for employee rights which in some industries includes not being forced to work non-traditional hours."
Why is the Indian government promoting RuPay cards?,"For each transaction that occurs on these payment networks, banks need to pay anywhere between 1-3% as transaction fee to those respective networks, by decreasing the dependency on foreign networks, these transaction fees going to foreign countries is reduced. Also all the transaction data is stored in foreign countries by these networks which is a privacy issue.

RuPay uses Discover network for International transactions, so the acceptance issue is also reducing day-by-day."
Why is Japan so high in the ranking of GDP per capita but so low in the number of billionaires per capita?,"You are correct in supposing that there is a correlation between GDP per capita and the number of billionaires per capita. But the number of billionaires is also affected by the the income and wealth distribution in the country, especially at the top end of the distribution. A [recent study](https://www.adb.org/publications/sources-income-inequality-comparison-japan-and-united-states) found the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality) much higher in the United States (0.453) than in Japan (0.329), corroborating previous findings.

There are several possible contributing reasons as to why Japan has a far less unequal income and wealth distribution at the top. 

Firstly, a combination of the widespread destruction of WWII, the forced land reform under McArthur (which greatly reduced large land holdings), the high inflation after the war (which decimated the value of financial wealth), and the very high economic growth rates after the war, meant that wealth in the new post-war society predominatly evenly spread among the new large middle class and upper middle class working people.

Secondly, Japanese business culture is more corporativist and less individualistic. There is the expectation that you treat the company and the company treats you as family. Large wage discrepancies are not socially acceptable, and CEOs are paid far less than in the US or UK. The [ratio of CEO compensation to median employee pay is 265 in the United States, 201 in Britain, and 58 in Japan](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-VN/Insights/2019/12/ceo-pay-landscape-in-japan-the-us-and-europe-2019-analysis). This video gives an interesting insight into japanese corporate culture: 
[Japan CEO Takes The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjeTTQKRfWU)

Lastly, perhaps because of the corporativist culture, [Japan has very little entrepreneurial activity](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-entrepreneurship-vacuum-in-japan-why-it-matters-and-how-to-address-it/). This means far fewer 'self-made' billionaires, who make their fortune from creating 'unicorn companies'."

They typically just go a few feet above the water line, cut the drywall out, let the studs completely dry for a few weeks, then put in all new stuff for everything below the water line. 

Is is cheap, hell no, but its far from a total loss.

TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

"Is it true that ""For most U.S. workers, real wages have barely budged in decades?""","There are two confounding issues when looking at the real wage series:

1. A lot depends on the inflation index used to calculate real wages. Statistics showing stagnant wages are often using CPI, which likely overstates inflation. Using other inflation measure show rising real wages.

2. The composition of household size has changed over the years. More single households means lower household incomes even if people on average are earning more. 

Given this, real wages have likely been rising. Also, non-monetary compensation has been increasing, mainly because health care costs have been rising like crazy.

However, given that income inequality has been rising, it is almost certainly true that median wages have not been rising as fast as GDP."

As to the snowball effect, I would just be incredibly patient. Keep doing what you are doing; don't stop. And don't obsess over monthly and yearly statements. Just keep going forward.

I'm an old guy (late 50's). I didn't really perceive or focus on the proverbial snowball effect until I was in my late 40's. Obviously, I'm not a brilliant investor, and I've always been focused on index funds vice individual stocks. Also at this point in my life, I'm focused on the extent to which passive returns can cover more and more of our annual budget. So it also matters what one means by ""snowball effect."" At this point in my life, ""snowball effect"" means balancing each additional year in the workforce versus living off of passive investments. I'm waiting for passive returns to replace my income, and that's hard to do with index funds. We're giving it a go, however.

tl/dr: It took me decades to perceive the snowball effect in any material way."

I'll bite. Throwaway, but maybe my new FIRE dedicated account.

My wife and I have worked our entire careers in education. M\[33\], F\[35\], our first child is on the way. She has worked in K-12 and I have worked at the college level in administration. We were both first generation college students. Her parents were immigrants and mine were working poor. We both lived extremely frugally and worked through college and we met while I was in graduate school. She was already an elementary teacher at that time. During and right after graduate school I took jobs working in residence halls which paid my housing costs. In 2014 I moved cross country and took a job in Alaska that also provided housing, while also offering a substantial pay bump. My wife was finishing graduate school. The move doubled both of our salaries and we continued to live rent-free. Mind you, none of this was easy work.

I discovered FIRE in 2014 after aggressively paying off student loans. Suddenly I had a lot of extra money but no desire to spend any more of it. It was just sitting in a checking account. While in Alaska we started a small business with a $3,000 investment that netted around $20,000/year on the side. We maxed out retirement plus 403b's as we were both in education.  We also maxed out Roth IRA's. All of this possible because of living rent-free. I also used some of the extra money to start a doctoral program. In 2019 we left Alaska for a MCOL city that was booming for a job opportunity for me. Even though she took a little pay-cut, my salary almost doubled again, though for the first time in our marriage we would have to pay housing costs. We sold the business for around its annual profit to some friends because we needed to move quickly.

Now I know it's not THAT fat, but we went from a negative net worth when we married in 2012 to crossing one million in investments at the end of last year. No tech, no IPO. Working in education and side hustles the whole way and actually enjoying a decent work-life balance. This year I should earn my doctorate opening many even higher paying opportunities in the future. I love my field and intend to work for at least until my expected child can get through college (hopefully for free because I am working there). I may even move to faculty at some point and take a pay cut for a 9 month contract. That would put me on track to retire around 55 with at least 4M. I get it, that is slow to many of you and only on the edge of FAT, but in between my wife can take a few years off work to take care of our child and for us that is an incredible and life changing amount of money. In reality we have coast money NOW, something that our families could never have dreamed of. As icing on the cake, the house we bought has appreciated over 100,000 in a single year due to being in the most desirable neighborhood in a fast-growing city.  We are truly fortunate, but have also worked smart and hard. The number one contributed to our net worth has been a willingness to move for opportunity. That has also opened up opportunity in our personal lives, making many friends and having many adventures that would not have been possible if we stayed close to home.

If you read all of that congratulations. TLDR: Two people working in education and mostly not burning ourselves out, prioritizing early career jobs that offered housing, willing to move, and living a relatively frugal lifestyle saved their way to a nest egg that is now over 1 million in 8 years and should keep growing over the next 20 for a comfortable FAT-FIRE in our 50's."

Golden Cross FINAL UPDATE - Day of the Golden Cross,"We beat the price we needed today, which was $39.36 by a decent margin.  If the hedgies want to cross back at this point, they would have to get us below 24.58 tomorrow.  Something I realized yesterday, was that after a certain point, my equation returns a negative value, when this happens, it means that it becomes impossible to reverse the trend  the following day, because a stock price can't go negative.  I am sending some pictures to u/Lostcorpse to add to this post.  


Edit: here are the equations to calculate what you need the next day for the two averages to be equal (this will give you a golden cross if the 50 day is currently lower than the 200, or a death cross if the 50 day is currently higher than the 200)

(Sum(49 days)+x)/50=(Sum(199 days)+x)/200  
  
4\*(Sum(49 days)+4\*x=Sum(199 days)+x  
  
4\*x-x=Sum(199 days)-4\*Sum(49 days)  
  
3\*x= Sum(199 days)-4\*Sum(49 days)  
  
x=(Sum(199 days)-4\*Sum(49 days))/3  
  
where x is what you would need tomorrow to get them equal or keep them equal. If the following day's close price is higher than X than the 50 day average is greater than the 200 day average and you either get or keep a golden cross. If the next day is lower than x then you either get or keep a death cross.

If you want to go further and calculate what you need the next day for a death cross to be impossible the day after, because the day after would have to be less than 0 which is impossible on a stock

(Sum(48 days)+x+0)/50&gt;=(Sum(198 days)+x+0)/200  
  
4\*(Sum(48 days)+4\*x&gt;=Sum(198 days)+x  
  
4\*x-x&gt;=Sum(198 days)-4\*Sum(48 days)  
  
3\*x&gt;= Sum(198 days)-4\*Sum(48 days)  
  
x&gt;=(Sum(198 days)-4\*Sum(48 days))/3"

My background is time series feature engineering, if you asked me where to source alt data, what forecasting algorithm to use, what cv methodology to use, how to properly structure the backtest, how to optimize a market neutral portfolio, or build a backend to rebalance trades, I'd have no idea where to start and all of that stuff matters, a lot.

Can't wrap my head around this thought experiment about how banking creates money,"You're not getting anything wrong; the thing you are missing is that while money is created when it is loaned out, it is then destroyed when the loan is paid back. The increase in the money supply is not permanent.

Could every nation be wealthy?,"It is very difficult to assess, because our terms for wealth differ vastly. Generally speaking, in absolute terms yes, but in relative terms (obviously) no, and it will thus never feel that way. 1500 years ago people may have asked if every nation could be as prosperous as the Roman Empire. Now every country is vastly more wealthy than that, but we don't consider everyone rich. It is not that far-fetched to extrapolate this -- though it must be noted that we would require more efficiency (less inputs) as obviously the current rate of consumption does not account for the finite amount of resources we have.


As for your specific items (which are useful in a way because they provide a reference point to what you consider wealth), this is difficult. Lets treat them one by one to illustrate how difficult this is.

&gt;the vast majority be in the middle class

This is a relative measure. Generally, the majority of a country will always be middle class as it is the class in between upper and lower, and distributions of wealth and income often take the shape close to a bell curve. It could be that we see extreme polarization of course. But besides that, if we assume that the majority is middle class, this says nothing about whether they are worse or better off than they are now.

&gt; able to afford homes

Do they have to own homes or not? If not, the vast majority of humans can afford homes, as they generally live in them. The size and quality may differ (e.g. if population increases we may expect size to decrease, if technology keeps advancing forward, we may expect quality to increase) -- but how do we assess whether that is better? Is a smaller but better insulated/structured/less noisy home better, or worse?

&gt; car

There is no reason to believe that at some point the majority of people would not be able to own cars. But, things may change. As soon as everyone owns a car, something else may be the new thing and cars may be obsolete. Plus, increased environmental or safity requirements may make cars unnaffordable again for many, but at the same time garuantee higher quality on average. Additionally, people may choose to not own cars at some point.

&gt; outings

Define outings please; how I understand this word the vast majority of people have outings on a regular basis - even many of the very poor farmers I have worked with are able to visit family or spend a day off every now and then. The ''quality'' of those outings differs very much however from a month-long trip to a tropical paradise (unless they are living in one, obviously).

&gt; nation be modern, could every nation enjoy the living standards of denmark

This is a difficult question. ""Modern"" requires a definition. As for the living standards of Denmark, it depends on which part. Again, if we think of healthcare for example, there is no reason in particular to believe the levels of healthcare there can not (eventually) be exported elsewhere. But many other factors (levels of equality, work pressure, freedom of the press, democracy) are also in large part choices and institutional developments -- it is not so much the fact that these require large scale inputs which other countries do not have, but other countries ''consciously'' make the decision not to adopt them (consciously is an iffy term here, there is obviously some path-dependency and the decision is often not made by the people but by those in power, but the point is that even if the economies of the world completely stop growing or shrinking, adopting these standards should be possible).

&gt; the way economics are there must be inequality, unequal exchange, etc?

This is the only question with a clear answer: no. But important to remember here is the fact that a) everything is a trade-off and b) implementation can be difficult. For example, theoretically, it is definately possible to make everyone equally well-off. Practically this is very difficult however. Plus, forcing equality may lead to a situation where everyone is worse off (this is why we see forms of the [original position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position) returning so very oftenly -- it may be better for those worst off to accept some inequality, and it is something we could argue they should, or at least could, agree to). In general, however, inequality is as much of a choice as it is a design. If we think of the global situation right now, rich countries investing large sums of money in the poor countries will level the playing field and may help overcome poverty traps leading to positive returns even for the country of origin. But these returns may not materialize and in general, in the short-term, the rich countries will lose out. 


Think of that last point in this manner; if you think cleaners are often not payed enough, you could launch a bid for the cheapest cleaner and then actively decide to pay them more. Will you do that though? If you are forced to do it instead, this may lead to inefficiencies, plus it largely limits your freedom. As for the ""raw truth"", please note that I am not juding which is better, I am merely pointing out the trade-off.

In short; it is a very difficult question to answer. Predictions are generally difficult, but for us to consider this question we need a very well-defined reference point as to what is a ''wealthy'' country."

India’s historic stock market boom is worrying its central bank,"I made most of my investments in the market just after the 2014 elections. I realized how much I had missed the boat by not investing earlier. 

And since then, until now, my portfolio was so lukewarm that I had considered offloading everything more than once. But I stayed put simply because I was advised that long-term investing is key (the 7 year cycle or whatever), and also because it made no sense to take my money out at such low growth rates since it would mean I lost money on the investment. 

In the past year however, everything is shooting up again. I am not sure the growth I see in my portfolio (mostly MFs) are deserving of the 7 years it had stayed invested. But nevertheless, it's growth. 

I'm wondering if I should offload everything now. For long-term investors, this current rally seems like a ticking time bomb."

&gt;*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

I can imagine the sheer number of transactions this would invoke would be pretty taxing in gas fees in the old system.

Once built the reality is quite different: it's boring out in the middle of nowhere, there's too much space to be usable and maintain. The design, when actualized, is not as great as you were imagining, etc. People want to build something huge and grandiose but really only want to maintain and live in about \~3000-4000sf.

Another problem is that you simply can't build like they used to (often because of zoning height restrictions.) Huge rooms need proportionally high ceilings. For instance, when you have a 40ft wide room it looks super depressing with 8ft coffered ceilings.

Lastly, homes are status symbols and the people that build multi-million dollar homes are often high level status seekers. As design trends change and location trends change, they feel compelled to move on."

"$200,000 and counting...hopefully up","I think your strategy is fine under the current conditions (disclaimer: I've also been selling low-delta $TSLA puts the last few weeks), but you'll need to consider what happens when current conditions change, and what you'll do then. For example, playing devil's advocate a bit: 

* Suppose $TSLA does drop big after earnings, and you're assigned at $500. How are you growing your account then? Maybe by selling covered calls, in which case you're running the wheel on $TSLA - nothing wrong with this, but how sure are you that this will beat just buying and holding the stock, given $TSLA's demonstrated potential for big jumps to the upside, which you could miss out on with covered calls? And what do you do if $TSLA keeps dropping below $500? After all, many people argue that $TSLA is currently massively overvalued. 
* Suppose $TSLA rises back up to $800 or $900, maybe quickly after blowout earnings or maybe gradually over several months. By then, you're most likely not going to get as much premium on a $500 strike put anymore - what do you do then? Do you stick with the same strike and accept the lower premium, in which case you're netting ever less premium per week? Or maybe you sell a higher strike put - you're happy to own $TSLA at $500, but are you happy to own it at $600 or $700?
* Otherwise, if $TSLA stays rangebound for an extended period of time, it's very possible that IV will start to decline, given the lower observed volatility. Similar to the previous scenario, what do you do then, when your premiums are shrinking? Maybe move on to a different stock that you're willing to own at a particular price - but what if all such stocks are exhibiting low IV, e.g. due to broader market-wide conditions?

Other changes can disrupt your strategy as well, whether macroeconomic, industry-specific, or company-specific. I would hazard to say that it's not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" a change that disrupts your strategy will happen. So my answer to your question of ""is that it?"" would be no - there will eventually be a time when your strategy is no longer effective, and you will need to be able to identify when this is happening and adapt accordingly."

How is Japan keeping inflation so low?,"Low inflation isn't a good thing (and neither is high inflation). The Japanese government and central bank have been trying to raise inflation for years. 

Some inflation encourages consumption and lowers the cost of debt. Central banks usually target an inflation rate of 2%.

I'm no expert on the Japanese economy but their ageing population is a reason. Also, when inflation is low people expect it to stay low, making it harder to actually increase it!   
Most countries are facing the opposite problem now. Because inflation has been high for quite a while, people will expect inflation to remain high and start demanding higher wages, reinforcing the inflationary effect."
**UPDATE ON THE GLOBAL SHIPPING CRISIS,"I would say your assertion that the Us and EU gave ""consumers never before seen levels of disposable income"" is incorrect and more of a line that people have made.

The bigger thing is that people who were employed at the time stopped spending disposable income on everything from vacations, to gas, to eating out and they had less outlets for entertainment so they turned to shopping as well as folks deciding to fix up homes and offices. The ""giveaeay"" thing is a trope thats not really true or a very small part of the increase in shopping."

Is social media's 'Jeff Bezos - eat the rich' narrative misinformed fearmongering?,"The posts you see aren’t asking Bezos to sell off his stocks. They’re indicating he should be taxed more to fund social programs that would fix a lot of the income inequality in America. 

Bezos has no incentive to sell off his stocks, and you’re correctly positing it’d devalue the remaining stocks for him to sell off large amounts of them. But he has no need for all of the extra wealth begotten by those stocks and profits and gains on them.

I work in sustainable development in an emerging market (Indonesia should be the world’s 4th largest economy if it grows at its current pace). Pollution here is rife - and much has to do with manufacturing supplying to US, China &amp; Europe. Also, the issue of plastic dumping from Europe &amp; US is massive. We have the world’s most polluted river in Java.

Is there research into how much economic behavior is driven by false beliefs and misconceptions?,"Yes there is work on this- and I hope someone posts examples regarding the examples you posted, but incorrect beliefs driving behavior shows up a lot in fields I study, such as development economics, which are probably not the ones you are thinking of. There is a whole literature on economies stuck in equilibriums of social norms/beliefs that actually do not persist anymore in society. I can find some seminal papers and link them here, but one paper that comes to mind: [Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs](https://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/publications/why-being-wrong-can-be-right-magical-warfare-technologies-and-persistence-false)

Some examples that from fields I work in that immediately come to mind:

Women's labor force participation remains very low in developing countries, which has microeconomic implications on their well being and macroeconomic implications obviously because it effects labor supply. One paper shows that in Saudi Arabia- where men have to give permission for women to work in the market- many men do not grant this permission because they *incorrectly perceive* other members of their community to shun this behavior, even though their community actually has more pro women's labor force views. But because everyone individually has false perceptions over social norms, they dont let their wives work. correcting those beliefs leads to substantial increases in womens labor force participation ([link](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180975))

Other examples: sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by stalled fertility transitions- aka families have many kids, which many consider not so good outcomes because of its connection to lower investments in their human capital (its expensive to educate 8 kids vs 2 kids)- which stagnates growth, and is tightly linked to [lack of female autonomy](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181085) over arguably the most important decisions in their lives. incorrect beliefs play a factor in these decisions, and when corrected, we see huge changes in behavior that are sometimes more effective than typical interventions:

Women have persistent incorrect beliefs about the effectiveness and cost of contraceptions, and simply informing then of the true effectiveness may be a much more effective and less costly policy of allowing women to reach their desired fertility ([link](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27271)

Men in these countries tend to have incorrect beliefs about the maternal risks of pregnancy, and that drives much of their desire for wanting more kids than their wives. Correcting these beliefs heavily align husband and wive's desired fertility level ([link](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171106)"

* For Deposits - Initially there was no online transfer available. So, you need to fill some forms which can be downloaded and they will arrange you a pick up from bank to collect the form. You don't need to go to bank to submit the form. Bank will charge FX transaction fess which came around RS.2000 for me when I deposited $800 USD. Now, I believe online transaction is available if you have account with HDFC and ICICI. 
* For Withdrawals - Vested charges $11 + FX transaction fees from bank
* For tax - To avoid getting taxed from both US and India there is some double tax avoidance agreement between US and India. Dividends which you get will get taxed in US and Capital gain(Long term/short term) will be taxed in India. For dividends, tax amount will be automatically detected from your account and only remaining amount will be deposited to your Vested account. Everything is clearly mentioned in transaction history. Then, from your vested account you can either withdraw it to your bank or keep re-investing in stocks.
* For tax documents - They provide following documents pre-filled for each financial year. General Filings Summary, Foreign asset filing summary, Form 67 filling summary.
* Support - So far had good customer support during account opening and for deposit.

And when they break it down,

""Thirty-eight percent of employees said they sometimes live paycheck-to-paycheck, 17 percent said they usually do and 23 percent said they always do.""

It becomes quite clear that it is not what ""normal people"" mean by paycheck-to-paycheck. How do you ""sometimes live"" paycheck-to-paycheck in a manner in which we should be concerned? This month my car and homeowners insurance both came due so I had to use my whole monthly paycheck to cover that plus my regular living expenses, I certainly should not be a concern because I sometimes live paycheck to paycheck. When I was significantly poorer than I am now I was often able to put a few $100 into savings some months(generally summing to $1000-2000 per year in savings) then ""surprise"" (not really surprises but not regular monthly stuff) bills would knock that down to zero or slightly negative for a most months out of the year.

"How come so many rich people are in Berlin, Germany? What are they actually doing to earn that much money?","Germany has built a lot of their economy around small and medium sized businesses.

You don’t need much more than €200k a year to afford that type of lifestyle. Maybe even less. Especially not with money as cheap as they currently are. Presumably there is also something about those areas that attract rich people, which can make their numbers seem exaggerated. Remember that Germany is 83m people. So there are 830,000 people in the 1%. That’s a lot of rich people."

Can Banks Literally Create Money and Profit Off of it?,"When banks create money out of thin air for loans, they create an asset and a liability on their balance sheet.

An asset, because the debt is something the borrower has to pay back, and a liability because of course the bank has to pay out that money to the borrower as well.

So if the principal of the loan is paid out, the bank ""loses"" the loaned money, if the loan is paid back, it gains that money back. Point being, there is no *net* gain from the principal of the loan.

&gt;As an additional side note, what are the consequences of this 'new money' if this is true. This seems like it would be a driver of inflation to me.

Yes, that's kind of the point. Central bank control interest rates, through that they control the price of loans, therefore the supply of loans and how many loans get made, therefore the money supply."

If I recall correctly, Ken Griffin wasn't even able to directly answer a question about if they were rampantly shorting $GME and instead kept dropping back to a generalized answer about ""The regulations after 2008 largely stopped the naked shorting abuses...""

EDIT: As correctly pointed out, Plotkin didn't even say he closed, just that he *started to close* the position at a loss.

Gamestop GME surges 30% on no news! Come visit Superstonk to know why!,"There could be many reasons why it's going up but we will never know.

Maybe they somehow found a way to push the cycles by 1 month (from February 22-24 to March 22-24). This might explain XRT going to regsho and SI going up. They had to short even harder to prevent run ups while they switched the timing on their swaps and FTDs. 

Or, the huge spike in ETF FTDs in January (or was it December) is finally coming to fruition. They held out on buying in February and are starting their cover now. If price action doesn't continue tmr, I think this could be it.

If today's price action continues up until wednesday close, I think that indicates OPEX as OPEX ends on T+2 from a Friday (which includes Wednesday if dark pools are used).

Or it has somehting to do with ETF rebalancing? because all the meme stocks went up at same time"
Is it true that America could end homelessness for 10 billion every year?,"Theoretically, this is true, and I think practically it's mostly true. The only trouble is that the 500,000 people you're referencing are not all in the same location, and the U.S. is a federal system, meaning we give a fair amount of  autonomy to state/local governments. This would make such a program difficult to administer holistically. 

It could be done, but it would probably take a while to fully realize the results between zoning all the housing, contracting to build said housing, creating advertising campaigns for the program, employing people to manage the housing and services, etc. However, at the end of the day, the issue of homelessness is a surprisingly affordable problem to solve, and it's a shame the U.S. doesn't make a more concerted effort to tackle its homeless population. 

One of the more interesting things about speaking with someone I knew from Sweden: they had never even seen a homeless person until drove out of the airport after landing... in the U.S."
Where is the edge in selling premium? What most newcomers miss that is extremely important.,"Another important point here is that for you to have this edge over time, you need to trade **many occurrences**. This leads to the advice ""trade small, trade often"".

You trade small to avoid sequencing risk and prevent a string of bad trades from wiping you out. Every trade should have its risk sized so that your max loss (or buying power reduction, for undefined risk trades) is between 1-5% of your total net liquidity. In lower volatility environments be closer to 1% (so you don't get bitten too badly when volatility expands). In higher volatility environments the opportunity is greater, so you lean in more towards 5%.

You trade often to get your number of occurrences up, which lets the probabilities play themselves out over time. You need a couple hundred trades on the books before the variance will settle down and you'll start to see the long term edge in your performance numbers."
Why do companies have a lot of cash AND debt?,"Because debt is super cheap right now.  Let's look at this at a smaller scale when it makes sense.  Say you want a new car, and you can get a 2% interest rate.  Instead of paying $30k up front for your new car, you take on debt.  Your $30k can earn you money in many other ways and exceed the interest on your debt.   

It's not all that much different for a company.   Debt lets you leverage your money. Cheap debt can be a very smart move.  When you analyze financials, you often want to be looking for companies that are utilizing debt effectively; the company you're looking at appears to be doing so."
"Currently scared to invest in US stocks, when looking at the P/E ratio, Buffet indicator. Am I alone thinking the bubble will burst or am I alone freaking out? Advice needed.","Yes, according nearly all the metrics like CAPE, forward P/E, P/E the US market is overpriced and we are getting closer to 2000 levels with CAPE.

However, if you look at US mid caps, small caps they look ok and many foreign markets including Europe are reasonably priced. So, if you are looking for a 'correction' look at what happens around the 3 Fed intrest rate hikes next year, but it is unlikely that these corrections will be more than 10 - 15%. 

As for the Buffet indicator I think it should only be used together with other indicators as a lot of companies listed in the US do buisness abroad and have made many aquistions of foregin companies in the past and how do you calculate ADRs into this?"

How the Italian pension system has become a Ponzi scheme,"To be fair, this is a STRUCTURAL issue across almost all public pension systems in Europe. The only difference is that Italy's pension system is rendered worse by: (1) an older than average population and (2) 40+ years of mismanagement of resources.

On #2: public pension funds in Italy were split by trade a few decades ago (doctors had their own, lawyers had their own and so forth). They have always being plagued with horrible money management and corruption... like renting out houses at low rates to friends of management, investing in crappy companies for political returns, etc.

I mean.. the current AUM (asset under management, *patrimonio* in Italian) of INPS (Italy's pension fund) is NEGATIVE. Negative. They manage a negative amount of money to pay pensions. This is hilarious by itself. They live purely of mandatory workers' contributions and general tax revenue passed on by the state. However, I believe that the Italian government(s) will never allow INPS to fail, because it is basically what the country is based on. They will cut EVERYTHING and EVERYWHERE before allowing any kind of restructuring of the pension system, barring a civil war.

One final thought though: the problem of aging is an issue for private pension systems, too. If too many people retire at the same time, they will all sell assets at the same time creating a collapse in prices. It is a structural issue of diminishing birth rates in the Western world.

EDIT: adding the source of INPS' AUM being negative as of 2022. INPS spends 340 Billion per year to cover pension and disability expenses, but only receives about 240 Billion in contributions from workers. The difference is covered by their assets (which have been depleted to become negative at the end of 2021) and by the Government. They are a pension fund only in name, de facto it is the government maintaining the scheme alive with money from general taxation.

Who was correct in their ideas of the boom and bust cycles Hayek or Keynes?,"Both were wrong in many ways and correct in a few. 

In terms of business cycles, Keynes was ""more correct"". There is a reason that the standard macroeconomic model of business cycles is called the New Keynesian model.

There are grains of truth in Hayek's theory of business cycles. There has been some research in the role of credit on crises, but it's far from the dominant role that Hayek speculated it would be. ""Credit cycles"" would be the phrase to google if you want to find modern research on the subject.

Speaking in broak strokes, a Keynesian theory would predict that recessions are abnormal deviations from the 'true' path of GDP due to demand shortfall and that, once demand recovers either over time or due to government intervention, GDP will return to its 'normal' state. On the other hand, a Hayekian theory would predict that recessions are natural 'corrections' that occur when GDP is growing 'too fast' due to government intervention.

In the former case, we would expect to see that large recessions are typically followed by large expansions; if the economy drops very far from it's 'natural' path, then there will be a lot of growth as it catches up. In the latter case, we expect to see that large expansions are followed by large recessions; if recessions occur to correct GDP back down to its natural level, then larger expansions mean GDP further above the natural level and requires a large recession to correct.

So a natural empirical test to distinguish between the two is: does the size of the recession predict the size of the expansion or is it the other way around.

In the data, the former appears to be the case. Larger recessions are followed by larger expansions, lending support to the Keynesian interpretation of things. This is often called ""Friedman's Plucking Model"" which you can google if you'd like to read the papers about it for yourself.

/u/RobThorpe probably knows more about the exact specifics of what Hayek and Keynes theorized than I do."

Are we nearing a global financial meltdown?,"1 - Evergrande's situation is being dealt with by the chinese central bank pretty well (they increased liquidity to cushion a potential default, which didnt happen) and they're still somehow meeting all of their obligations. A growth slump in china could very well have real consequences but pretty much everyone knows that at this point and it's definitely priced in the markets.

2 - This is not what caused the great depression nor the 2008 crisis, not at all. Markets currently price in a fed hike in rates somewhere around September 2022, and you can actually see that (Fed Fund Futures tell you about where the market expects rates to be in the future). So yeah, hiking rates in sept? No bit deal. Tomorrow? A crash yeah, but no financial meltdown, it's still only 0.25%

3 - The US will never default on its debt and they will find a way as they always did. No one gains from that, everybody loses big times

Going forward when you try to look at a future path for financial markets, think about what's priced in. If you thought about a coming supply shock back in summer 2020 when it didn't cross anybody's mind, you'd be right to expect inflation and a selloff in us bonds.

"SOPA, the entertainment industry's attempt to legislate artificial demand for their products, and a declaration of war against the growing tech industry.","SOPA is a horrible piece of regulation, but to really quantify it is tough because it crosses two disciplines (IT and economics) which are not often interlinked. 

It is also difficult because a lot of the secondary effects are hard to estimate. SOPA overturns safe harbour provisions that internet communications have been built on and gives politically favoured corporations the power to take down other businesses' websites without due process. That could be a disaster or just a mild (though perpetual) risk for internet businesses, depending on how the recipients of these powers choose to use them. 

The power given to judges and IP holders to stick their fingers into the internet's core infrastructure through DNS tampering could be a disaster if other countries take up the precedent and end up fracturing the internet. But even the techsperts are unsure how that would unfold and the economic impact is another layer of tea-leaf reading on top of that. 

Estimating the economic / technical damage is even harder when you allow for the fact that the internet is changing so fast and these powers are perpetual. There's no way to guess how this will affect the operation of the internet in 20 or 30 years. So it isn't a 'natural' issue for economists in that it defies quantification and traditional measures like a cost benefit analysis. But it is very important, and where we can't emphasise cold hard numbers, we can outline the potential scale of the threat. We need to be out of our comfort zones and fighting this. "

That said, even respectable academics are sometimes justifiably critical of the relevance of some publications. The editors are human and often make unpopular decisions based on their own judgment/bias.

Who was here and survived the last big crash in crypto in 2013 and how does that compare to now?,"I was there. 

Last time was way way worse, there were actual reasons to worry. Trading was severely centralized in Mt. Gox and it being run as a fractional reserve put the entire market into question. 

Was also there during the DAO hack, the first few days were very concerning. I thought seriously of selling my Ether. After reading a lot and understanding the problem from a technical perspective I ended up buying more Ether. The way it was handled made me understand that the Ethereum community was something else and that the Ethereum Foundation had the right leadership and principled approach to make the project succeed. 

This time I see not much reasons to be concerned. Tech keeps progressing and in the right direction, the fundamentals are much better than they have ever been. 

Here is what I see, a few disordered thoughts written from my phone: 

Crypto enthusiasts are rather young and with that comes impatience. How wouldn't they?! 4 years is almost 25% of their existence. So seeing how the tech progresses slower than expected can discourage many. 

Most people have not worked in large-scale and difficult research projects, estimating deadlines is pretty much impossible. It will always be finished later than your worst estimations. And that can discourage the not so young ones. I think the Ethereum researchers made a rookie communication mistake promising deadlines. 

The markets got veery far ahead of themselves, propelled by some likely manipulation (the whole USDT always smelled like shit to me and still don't trust it) and market mania that attracts the get rich quick types. A correction was more than necessary.

There is an eerie feeling of recession in the air. The financial market as a whole are nervous, capitals flight riskier investments first. Crypto bubble poped, next went the emerging markets... I also expect crypto to recover first and faster, specially if the next crisis is a debt fueled crisis as it seems to be. 

The ICO craze is taking a rough one on ETH. People threw money stupidly to unfinished projects for tokens that didn't even grant ownership on the project or its future revenues (few exceptions aside, like that casino that paid dividends). Now those projects are unloading their ETH as their opportunity to cash out on their scams seems to be running thin. This is creating a mispricing as there is more ETH being unloaded on the markets than people ready to buy it. The biggest opportunities to make money are always in situations like these, when the markets are not efficient.

I was in a similar boat as you a while back, and would just like to give you a piece of advice, that you haven't asked for but i feel is important.

  


DO NOT REVEAL YOUR REAL MONTHLY INCOME TO ANYONE. ANYONE.

  


Not your father, not your brother, not your best friend, not your girl friend, and definitely not to that aunt.

  


Yes, your parents have your best interests at heart, but they're also likely to reveal it to others in a moment of pride. Yes, your best friend is amazing, but you don't know who he may reveal it to when he's drunk.

AGAIN, DO NOT REVEAL YOUR REAL MONTHLY INCOME TO ANYONE. ANYONE.

  


I've had to deal with a lot of crap because a couple of relatives got to know my TC. If you do wish to justify your new lifestyle (ideally lifestyle creep would be minimal, but what's the point of all that hard work if you don't get to enjoy it?), say that your new job pays 30-40lpa (still eye popping but can justify most expenses with this), or say that it pays 25lpa and that you got a ""bonus"" while making a huge lumpsum buy."

You have more than enough data experience from your job, and the fact that you referenced thinking outside the box is great — that’s exactly the process Econ research takes. If you want to learn more about Economics, I’d start by reading some empirical papers. You’ll likely come across concepts you don’t understand, and have to google those, but I expect an intro Economics textbook would be way below your level. To start with, I think you’d like the [Journal of Economic Perspectives](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep). JEP asks economists to write general-interest pieces on their speciality, so it’s less technical than the typical journal, but still incredibly interesting. If you stumble on a topic you find interesting in JEP, look for articles on that topic and learn more! In terms of data superpowers, you could look at an econometrics textbook or journal but honestly you’d be much better served doing an online data science course in R or Stata. The coolest coding I’ve done in Econ has come from [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) courses, though they’re more about modeling than data analysis. 

Now, in terms of accreditation, there’s basically no way to become a capital-E Economist without going back to school. You won’t publish without a PhD, and you won’t be a corporate economist without an MBA or a masters. However, there’s way more to economics than degrees, and I think you could get a lot out of the discipline without them. Feel free to dm me if you have any questions, and again I’m coming at this from a very different perspective than you but I’m sure others in this sub have been in similar places."
How do owners take on more risk than employees? And does it justify their much higher pay?,"No one is compensated purely for risk - employees are compensated for supplying labor and shareholders are compensated for supplying capital. Each then earns a risk premium based on how risky the option they choose is relative to their next best option.

Employees face comparatively little risk - the risk of losing your job is inherent to any job and leaves you in no worse position than not having a job in the first place. They're paid 1 month in arrears, so at most they have a couple of months outstanding if the business fails and, in the event of failure, they typically have the highest ranking claim against the business besides the costs of the bankruptcy itself. In many jurisdictions there are also government schemes to cover the unpaid wages of failed businesses.

For shareholders, they can earn risk-free returns by investing in government bonds. The relative risk of investing in equities is substantial - they pay money upfront with no guarantee of even receiving the principle back, never mind profits. In the event of failure, they rank last, paid after all employees, suppliers, creditors etc, typically losing everything. As such, they earn a significant risk premium - although less than you might imagine: market risk premiums are typically around 4-6%.

For owners/founders, they're a hybrid of employee and shareholder, plus there's an element of compensation for ""entrepreneurship"" - more than just taking risks, they had a novel idea, spotted some advantage etc.

For CEOs, they're basically just highly skilled employees - they're not compensated for risk, they're compensated by shareholders for the perceived value they add to profits. Debateably, their high pay also reflects exploitation of the principle/agent problem, where CEOs basically set their own pay, subject to shareholder outrage, which gives them significant latitude because shareholders are typically diffuse and hard to organise."

Moving kid from private to public school,"Way back we consciously decided to stick to the public system all the way, and use our financial resource instead on targeted purposes outside of school, e.g. music instrument tuition, arts classes, sports that are not cheap, or lifestyle expenses such as annual overseas trips.   They just finished high school and I think we did quite alright.

We conceptually saw private system like going to a buffet, you pay more for the overall package and have access to much better resources, but the kid may or may not derive value from all of it.

"My grandparents have been renting out two-bedroom units for $900 a month in one of the hottest housing markets in the country, but only to working-class people","I think we sometimes look at all that is wrong in the world, and it feels like the problems are all too big to do anything about.

Sick/personal leave - how do you guys feel about it?,"Working in HR, my suggestion is to decide how much time you want off (1 months, 2 months?) then go see a doctor and explain you’re burnt out etc, want to use X weeks of your sick leave, and get a certificate. What most people do is take a few days, then extend a bit more, then maybe a few more days - usually because they feel guilty. But it’s no good for you because you’re actually not relaxing, you’re stressed about taking leave and still thinking about work. And it’s also more annoying for an employer and team mates because it’s harder to cover for a few days. 

If you get the cert, then go and tell your manager that you have some health issues that you need to take care of and your doctor has recommended you be off for X weeks and will be back on Date. That way everyone is clear and you can actually use this time to forget about work completely and relax. 

Once you have this headspace, use the paid time to decide what to do next - you might come back to work refreshed, or you might decide to quit. Either way put yourself first."

**UPDATE ON THE GLOBAL SHIPPING CRISIS,"1. Nothing’s getting shipped because the ports and warehouses are jammed, and the containers are stuck at the ports and on ships.
2. The ships are stuck at sea, because the ports are understaffed, and can’t clear cargo fast enough. This causes truck drivers to wait hours at the port, losing money and quitting.
3. Warehouses are also jammed with unloaded cargo, because they are understaffed, and there aren’t enough drivers to take stuff out, because wait times make it unprofitable.
4. This whole mess is partly due to increased demand outpacing storage and labor supply, but mostly due to chronic understaffing.

Is that about to right?"

The price started at $26,000, I kept saying no, the price got down to $13,000 plus monthly payments. I just laughed at them and was amazed that every single person in that room was signing papers. I did receive the discount Disney tickets, and the 3 college tuitions have been successfully paid for.  I have not heard from my new best friends in 20+ years."

"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","The problem with your suggestion is that after things return to normal companies may no longer exist.

A company has fixed costs, such as rent, maintenance etc., that it needs to cover during the quarantine period. When the pandemic is over, ideally people will just return to their existing jobs.

Now imagine that you let companies go bust. What would happen is that their existing capital is going to get auctioned to cover their debts. Maybe the aircraft get bought by an international competitor that was bailed out. Now they have a monopoly over your market and increase prices.

An even worse scenario is if no aviation buyer can be found. They will all be in a precarious position after all. Then the aircraft may be sold for scrap. The buyer will simply disassemble them and sell the valuable parts. Now you have actually decreased the total amount of capital in the economy. So when things resume there won’t be enough planes for all the usual customers. Hence people will need to fly less.

Now multiply your aviation example throughout the economy. You can see why this is not a great idea."
How do landlords decide rent prices?,"This

&gt;other landlords will use this to justify raising rents on larger units to match the overall rate.

is equivalent to saying that you're currently paying too little for rent because your landlord doesn't know the value of the property or that rent prices are pinned down by social norms. This might be true for individual units -- it's not hard to imagine a longterm tenant having a sweetheart rental deal --, but it's generally not true for entire markets. 

In practice, there are two ways where new construction can impact local rent prices (at the metro live, new supply pretty much universally brings down prices). 

1. Supply effects where increased housing forces landlords to compete for tenants, which they typically do by lowering prices (you could imagine other ways of competing like increased amenities, parking spaces, etc, but the main way is price).
2. Amenity effects. Most plausibly, density allows for more restaurants, bars, public transit, and other amenities. So the neighborhood gets nicer, but this also tends to push rent price up. I would caution people against thinking this is tooo common, though because if it were always the case that new apartments lead to higher prices we would never see declining cities and real estate could get near infinite rent prices.

Empirically, the [first effect tends to dominate the second](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5d00z61m?), so you should expect that those apartments will exert downward pressure on rent prices.

**BIG NOTE:** One thing that people have a lot of trouble with regarding new apartments is the idea of counterfactuals. Apartments get built where there is increased demand, meaning areas where there was already upward pressure on prices. So in most places you should actually expect to see price increases in areas with new apartments, unless there's a major construction boom. They key is that rent prices will be lower than what they would have been had the apartments not been met. You can think of a fireman analogy: arrival of fire trucks tends to be correlated with burnt buildings,, but we would never say that fire departments cause fire."
"Yo, Where's u/Peruvian_Bull at? The dollar short squeeze has started in the FX markets, come take a victory lap man!","I'm right here! The Dollar Milkshake Theory is playing out in real time. 

Global demand for dollars INCREASES during the end of a currency regime, because the whole system de-levers and all these foreign countries need to pay off their debt. Remember most foreign countries have their debt denominated in dollars.

So they will sell treasuries and US equities in order to get dollars. And most of all their own currencies.

The dollar will scream higher on foreign exchange, while everything else falls. It is a strange world.

Edit: 

I made a thread on currency dynamics a few days ago here which got a ton of attention: https://twitter.com/peruvian_bull/status/1570825796025188353



second edit:

 everyone keeps asking me what this means. Basically, the Fed will have to eventually decide if they want to save the Eurodollar system and by extension, foreign countries from seeing their currencies collapse vs the dollar. 

They will have to re-run Plaza Accords (G7 agreement from 1985) to devalue the dollar.

All roads lead to more money printing. 

In a dollar endgame, the collapse begins at the periphery and moves to the core.

FAT Crypto Staking,"Yes, my crypto defi (decentralized finance) portfolio is in that dollar range. Also to preface, since I know this sub is mostly anti crypto, I am not a crypto maximalist or evangelist. I just like making money off of crypto.

I will talk about defi here, because I don't actually use what crypto people call ""cefi"" (centralized finance) which is staking through a company like Kraken or Gemini.

If you are really maximizing your yield and switching from one liquidity pool to another when rates change, then it does create a bit of a headache for taxes.

My strategy is split between about 15 different accounts, and almost entirely stablecoin based. I inventory each account every other day and calculate the average return on that account over the last 7 days. Since everything is variable return, I pull investments from a spot once the return is low compared to the other accounts and reinvest it somewhere else.

When you are staking millions instead of thousands (assuming you don't split it into multiple accounts like I do), investing on ethereum becomes more viable. The transaction fees will eat up your profits if your principal balance isn't high enough.

For safety, always wait for a project to be audited by a reputable auditor before investing. Places that are relatively ""safe"" compared to others would be Curve.fi which has around $24b on their platform, Aave which has $14b, Convex (which pairs with Curve to offer additional incentives/income) ~20b, UniSwap $8b.

One of the complexities of defi compared to cefi is that you need to take the proper steps to secure your funds, where as cefi someone else is doing that for you.

Cefi will get you around 8% on stablecoins. Defi will get you around 20%. Cefi is probably a better option for most people, unless you want to take a deep dive and figure out all of the technical aspects to do defi. I usually recommend people throw something like $10k into defi and figure it out for a few months before they throw a real amount of money in.

Like I mentioned, I track my investments very closely. For the year 2021 I got close to 40% return on my stablecoins across those 15 accounts. That return is before taxes of course, and almost all of that will be taxed as short term capital gains or income.


Edit: And to directly answer your bullet points:

- The amount I am staking is on the higher end of the range you specified.

- I am facilitating it through decentralized finance (defi). I do all of my staking using encrypted laptops that are single purpose, run on Ubuntu to maximize security, and also use hardware wallets to maximize security.

- Taxes are annoying. I am able to automate around 80% of it using bitcoin.tax and importing spreadsheets with my transaction records.

- My hedges are mostly security hedges, only investing in places that are audited, and diversifying my investments across many places. This made it so I was only hit by one investment in 2021 that lost funds, and it was only a 10% haircut on those funds.

- I am (or was I guess) a software developer that specialized in crypto related software. I guess I was better equipped than most to get into defi.

- I am pretty happy about what I knew when I got into staking through defi. I obviously don't know everything, but I learned new things along the way.

Main points are:
1. The composition of household size has changed over the years. More single households means lower household incomes even if people on average are making more.
2. Which inflation metric is used can have a big impact, and the statistics showing flat wages are often using CPI which is probably overstating inflation.
3. Non-monetary income (health insurance, retirement, etc.) has increased significantly but is not counted in these metrics. A big part of this is the rising cost of health care but that's a separate phenomenon."

3) Educate yourself on all things personal finance. Budgeting, tax-advantaged retirement accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, ETFs, index  funds, mutual funds, fiduciary advisors, and plenty more. Read the prime directive on r/personalfinance.

4) Don’t buy anything from someone who is selling. Pay people for their time and advice only. Use fiduciary advisors (those who are legally required to act in your interest, not theirs).

5) Don’t invest in anything YOU don’t personally understand.

Shouldn't I be investing thinking of myself as the owner of the business and not merely an investor. Of course some businesses have less room for growth eg utilities, then dividends do make sense.

Why doesn't the market 'fix' the chip shortage?,"I work in that industry. I broadly agree with the comments by XiKeqiang, Zahpow and SenorHonkachonka.

Semiconductor fabrication plants (""fabs"") take a long time to build and they're very expensive. Producers are aware that the shortage may be over in a few months. As a result it is not a good idea to start building new fabs now. By the time they're ready the shortage is likely to be over and they will have excess capacity on their hands. Most of these plants are already run 24 hours a day using shift systems, so it is difficult to increase utilization of existing plants.

It's worth mentioning how these things usually work. The supply chain is long and complicated and I will only describe a part of it. Firstly, companies produce raw silicon wafers and wafers of other semiconductor materials like Gallium Arsenide. Most things are made from silicon but a few are made from other semiconductors. These wafers along with many chemicals got to the fabrication plants and the companies that own them. The core of the integrated circuits (""ICs"") are then built using photolithography on the wafers. Many units are built from a single wafer. It depends on the size and complexity of the product. At least hundreds, often thousands and sometimes tens of thousands for low complexity products. They are not the finished product. To create a complete chip the piece of silicon is packaged in an enclosure, usually (but not always) made from epoxy resin. Mostly a package like this contains only one piece of silicon though some contain more. This package has wires in it to connect the piece of silicon beneath to the outside world. On the outside there are pins or pads. Then you have a completed chip. (Many in the industry don't like the word ""chip"" and call it an ""IC"" or just a ""part"").

COVID interrupted nearly every stage of this process. Many plants along the way could not run for periods of time. That includes the fab plants, the packaging plants and testing facilities. Supply chains often span several countries which makes things complex. If one of them has particular severe COVID restrictions then that creates a knock-on effect for the rest of the process. For example, one of the products I worked on a few years ago was like this.... The fab was in Taiwan. The completed wafers of circuits were then sent to the Philippines for testing. The chips were then sent to Malaysia where they were cut out and packaged. Then they were sent back to the Philippines for final testing in their finished state. The two testing steps were done by the same company, but the other steps were done by different companies. The company that designed the chip did not manufacture it, though it did the testing.

Also, at present there are shortages of the raw silicon wafers which are the input to the rest of the process. This is upsetting everything even in place where there weren't other problems.

Lastly, you have to remember that most electronics uses lots of chips. Open up a laptop and you'll see lots of them, dozens at least. The same is true if you look in the computers of a car. The problem is that a shortage of just one model of chip can make it impossible to build an entire product. It is usually not simple to replace a chip in an existing design with a different model or one from a different company. The producers must also maintain production of a very large number of different products. Some companies sell about 15,000 different models of chip, for example."
Secretly working 2 jobs?,"I [M28] currently do this and have done this for the last few years. Two (Non-FAANG) data science tech lead jobs. Primary is ~300k TC secondary is ~200k TC. Both are now FTE roles with standard bonus/LTI structures.

Both employers don’t know directly about each other but do know that I have “side gigs”.

Most of the time both are a 11am-3pm commitment and at the worst (~10% of the time) they are a combined 11am-7pm commitment. I do VERY ruthlessly block off time on my schedule for both companies. On each week I block off 2 days for a “heads down” session for each job (tues/thurs is “job1 time” mon/wed js “job2 time”). This allows me to focus on work for the other job without meetings. When meetings truly overlap… I often join both on mute and selectively choose when to contribute to the conversation by playing the “who do I mute” game. Both are full remote roles with a culture of cameras off on zoom.

During the start of Covid my 2nd job was a “burn and churn” company. It ended up consuming 60hrs/week and I couldn’t do hardly any real work for 8-9months for my primary job. Calls on weekends etc. work life balance was not respected so I left the 2nd job to find another at a more lax company. When I put in my notice they asked to double my salary (95/hr-&gt;180/hr). I had to refuse because working the two was unsustainable and it wasn’t worth risking burn out for the primary or stopping the 2-job gig all together. Month or two later I found my current 2nd FTE position at a much more lax company who GREATLY respects work life balance. 

My wife [F24] is also a FTE at company 2 as a SR data scientist on a sister team so often we offload to each other to share the load.

One comment here says that’s it is better to get good at one thing and stick to that to be better in the long run. I’ve heavily considered trying to seek the combined TC of both jobs elsewhere in the same field but haven’t had any luck. HR bands usually prohibit that level of comp for my age/degree level (didn’t graduate college). Currently our HHI is ~700k TC and, although we’re both very entrepreneurial, we often can’t think of a reasonably low risk alternative for a similar comp with the same or less stress levels/time commitment. Our goal is to continue this path for the next 2-3 years to build up a nest egg then have kids and single-tech job income coast to fatFIRE.

Why do socialist countries have lower % of GDP as government expenditures and revenue than many capitalist countries?,"This is the problem of ""actually existing socialism"" brought to the modern day. In particular, socialist states have always had much weaker institutions and weaker economies than capitalist states and as a result had less developed social policies than capitalist states. I suppose some in the 1960s-1980s Communist Bloc thought that by keeping ideological purity, so-called socialist states would eventually surpass capitalist states both in measures like social welfare and egalitarianism as well as economic development. But the problem then, and the problem today, is that the central planning function of a socialist state is generally associated with higher levels of government corruption and weaker development of institutions. The weak institutions present in these socialist states includes both the institutions around social welfare programs and the institutions around income tax collection (so government financing often relies on tariffs and selling raw materials produced by state-owned industry). Acemoglou and Robinson have a number of books on state capacity somewhat from an economists perspective - their 2019 book, The Narrow Corridor, might be a good source for more info. There are lots more work on this issue by sociologists and political scientists than economists, I think."
I owe u/-einfachman- an apology for my previous post that got quite a bit of traction.,"🦍 You're awesome, and I didn't take that post personally at all. I've made errors in past posts/comments as well, and Apes have had to reach out to me and inform me of my mistakes, and I had to edit my post/comment to correct them because I want to ensure the community is receiving accurate information. It's totally normal.

I remember last DD post of mine, there was that whole FC-02/06 thing from the DnB form I was wrong about, made an inaccurate statement on my DD post, and Apes corrected me, which led me to more research and discover the correct DTC memo from one Apes' DD that I used to correct my post and ensure everything was accurate.

So, it's not a big deal. And besides, I'm not infallible either, so I don't mind hearing the other side of the argument (as long as it's not abusive/ad hominem attacks or anything like that).

Even though I'm very confident in MOASS this year, especially bc of RC's BBBY calls expiry, I have to admit that there's a probability that I could still be wrong, and I'd have to pay for it and show my ass if I'm wrong. 😅 Also, I'd honestly feel really bad, because I don't want to let Apes down (which is why I've been really careful making a prediction like this). In this case, I'm just so confident that everything has been coming together, and RC's extremely OTM BBBY calls and expiry are a prime example of what's to come.

That being said, I totally understand all the Apes that are skeptical or against my train of thought, and I love y'all either way. See you on the moon. 🦍🚀🌑🦍💜"
The worst thing I did financially was seeing a financial planner,"Agree they shouldn’t have engaged you.

"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","I largely agree with /u/MachineTeaching, but I think there is some value in delving into this argument in the current situation. I would disagree, namely, that crises are per se not a force for creative destruction. But this is a pretty unique case.

&gt; Wouldn't it be far more efficient just to pay a UBI-type thing? (Note: I'm not advocating UBI per se, rather as a stop-gap in the current crisis.)


How efficient it is, in general, depends largely on how UBI is implemented and how the alternative is implemented. In this case, no, this is not more efficient.


Imagine the case of a restaurant. We can either keep the restaurant afloat and force them to pay their employees (or give the employees unemployment benefits). In many cases, these are loans. If the crisis then stops, people who have missed going out for dinner and perhaps build up savings, are likely to go out to dinner. The restaurant pays off their loan, and we are back at the same situation as before COVID. Now imagine a case where we give everyone money, but don't save the business. Now, once we go back to a normal situation, the former employees will lose their UBI *and* their job. While, immidiately after opening up, there may be price increases (as the reduction of available restaurants and the abundance of demand will lead to full restaurants) - but restaurants are likely to be price elastic and this effect will likely not last long. All of those losing their job will now have no income to spend, reducing aggregate demand and consumption, harming the economy.

&gt; If businesses are failing because no one is using them (e.g. air travel), then they are going to continue to need bailouts. Thinking bailouts are a one-time thing vs. ongoing UBI-type payments is unrealistic.


This argument proclaims knowledge on the future of businesses. In the current state it is not a fair argument because the right answer would be that many less people are using the businesses because they are urged or even forced not to. It should suffice to say that while you may not be wrong in the future, you may not be right either - and it is quite something to let politicians gamble on the future of technology. Perhaps, instead of more efficient trains or quicker cars, the air travel industry will innovate immensely and provide much cleaner and cheaper air travel. This problem is furthermore easily overcome by setting some minimum requirements to loans. You could imagine a system where a businesses are eligble only if they can illustrate that their turnover has been reduced greatly (e.g. 80%) since COVID (in fact, some countries do have this).

&gt; We've already seen companies using the cash to buy back stock. OK, we can put in legislation to stop that, but paying people would be far more efficient.


You provide no evidence for the second point, on which your premise is quite dependent. Because, seeing as you admit you can stop stock buybacks, all you are saying is that UBI is more efficient than bailouts, which they aren't necessarily.

&gt; Giving working people money maintains money flow - working people buy necessities, rather than investments.


Giving business money similarly maintains money flow. If a company is on the verge of bankruptcy, that likely means that they for example are failing to pay for rent, utilities, and (remaining) employees. The employee, land-owner, and those working at utility companies also need to be paid and also spend the money accordingly.


It is not the idea of such loans to be spend on large scale investments. That noted, the implication that spending it on investments rather than direct consumption is worse for the economy, is unsubstantiated. Again, if you do spend on investments, the money is still going somewhere.


&gt; Medium/long-term, we would realise either a) we don't need this/that industry or b) this industry needs to be more efficient. It would provide a huge opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship as people try to fill the vacuum left by collapsed companies.


This is not really a fair argument in the current situation. Basically what you are saying is that ''I think people in the future aren't going to be flying anymore''. As such, ''we should be letting them go bankrupt now''. This is flawed because, 1), you don't know that, and 2), even *if* there is no demand in the long-run, that doesn't mean the service they provide is not valuable now. Its like saying that UBI would be bad because ''I can give the money to person *x*, but that person will die eventually"". I also do not think you can substantiate that argument. We can have a discussion about travel agencies - sure, but are you, after COVID, not going to get your hair done anymore? Go out for dinner? The dentist? Clubbing/concerts? Public transport? Hotels? Massages? Spas? The Gym?"
Why no hyperinflation?,"The idea that changes in money supply lead to lock step changes in prices, derives from the quantity equation of money:

  MV = PT 

If V, velocity, is stable, and T, total transactions, is unrelated to changes in M, then any increases in M will lead to increases in P. 

The last 15 years have shown (last 30 years in Japan) that it's a fallacy to think that the quantity theory of money always holds. Krugman terms this fallacy, the idea that an increase in the money supply will always somehow cause inflation even if there is no economic overheating, [“the doctrine of immaculate inflation”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/opinion/cryptocurrency-inflation.html).

There are two issues with the quantity theory of money described above:  i) The relationship only holds in the *long run*, as M and T are related in the short run, and ii) If nominal interest rates are near zero, then velocity becomes unanchored, and money becomes as good an asset to hold as bonds (money and bonds become interchangeable). The latter situation is termed a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap).

A better model for inflation in the short run (and in the longer run if there is liquidity trap), is that inflation changes according to the state of the macroeconomy. Inflation will tend to accelerate if the economy is overheating (aggregate demand exceeds long run productive capacity), and inflation will tend to decelerate if the economy is in a recession.

To answer your question, inflation has not happened because the economy has not been overheating. There are signs that the economy may be overheating in the near future, and so inflation will probably increase. The FED has indicated that it will tolerate some inflation to make up for the low inflation experienced in the past, but if inflation picks up too much, the FED will likely raise interest rates to damp down demand, to hold inflation near their target."

Common personal finance mistakes,"The biggest personal finance mistake is 

1) Not knowing about personal finance.

2) Not wanting/caring to know about persona finance.

3) Buying products just to save taxes.

4) Not knowing/understanding the concepts of **Time Value of Money** and **Inflation**

As you mentioned, a financially literate person and a financially illiterate person will think so differently about money management. Not having the knowledge about basic financial concepts is the main problem that leads to other financial mistakes. They'll want to put their money to work for them, instead of letting it be idle. Before taking out a loan, they'll think twice about whether they really need it. Before they buy an expensive thing, they'll think if it's an Asset or a Liability. So many things will start going correctly once they understand the importance of personal finance.

Indians are generally *very* risk aversive. A lot of people won't invest in something if there's even a 1% chance that they'll lose some money. Such risk aversion causes people to *invest* in LIC policies &amp; insurances &amp; ULIPS and so on. It also causes people to buy a house as soon as they get a job, just so that they can save some taxes !"

How did Ireland manage to get out of poverty?,"In the last 30 years the economy of the Republic of Ireland has grown a lot. I live there, though I'm originally from the UK.

One of the most important drivers was and is low corporation tax. The low tax was a huge draw for international businesses. Let's say you're managing a US business starting a European subsidiary in the 1990s. You know you can make a profit by copying your US business model. You want to locate somewhere with native English speakers. Would you rather locate in the UK with a corporation tax rate of about 32% or in Ireland which had a corporation tax rate of 10% in the 90s? Plus, even up until the late 90s and early 2000s wage rates in Ireland were lower or similar to wage rates in the UK.

Ireland is in the EU. It's in the Eurozone as well as the Common Market. That's important because it has created a uniform regulatory framework for trade of goods and services. Ireland also received funds from the EU for development in the past, though it's arguable how important that was. Ireland has always benefited from being close to the rich countries of Europe, though in the past it hasn't used that benefit well.

The stabilization of the political situation in Northern Ireland was also useful."

"PSA: don't procrastinate, buy term insurance before 30/11/21","I have been researching a lot about what term insurance to get for the past couple of weeks. Here are some pointers (backed by an excel sheet calculation) which might help you to make a decision.  
Writing from a perspective of 26/Male/NonSmoker/.  
Annual Income: 22LPA (PostGraduate)  
Policy Term: 40 Years (Till the age of 66)  
I have a STAR Health Insurance policy of Sum assured 5L which will in addition pay 5L on death/Permanent Disability.  
And a LIC Jeevan Anand which will pay 10L whenever I die. (Regret it though)  
Companies (should be) considered (in no particular order): HDFC Life, Tata AIA, ICICI Prudential and MAX Life.   
Go for a reputable brand. Once you're gone your beneficiaries will have to deal with getting the claim. Better the company, easier for them in the moment of grief.  
E.g. ICICI Prudential @ 26 years of age.  
3 Cr - No riders - 40 Years - Regular Pay - Annual Premium \~25k.  
**Remember:**   
1) Insurance is not an investment.  
2) Account for inflation (5-6%) while choosing a policy cover. 1 Cr looks great as of now bur 15 years later it won't be sufficient. Choose a higher cover with affordable premiums.  
3) Increasing Cover option is a good choice. Limited companies provide it. The cover increases by a fixed % every year till it is 2x the starting base cover. Premiums are fixed lifelong.  
MAX and Bajaj Allianz offer increasing cover options. (Policy Bazaar)  
4) Don't confuse #3 with life-stage benefits in which you opt to increase the cover at marriage/kids and premiums also increase.  
TATA and ICICI offer Life Stage Benefits. (Policy Bazaar)  
5) MaxLife is showing a 5% discounted figure for the annual premium on Policy Bazaar. Your yearly premiums from the 2nd year will be not discounted, so a bit higher. (Refer to the strike-through figure on MaxLife official website for the actual amount)  
6) Use dummy data to explore the insurance aggregators and official sites to avoid spamming. (I made an official account 2 weeks later and got 4 property calls in 2 days)  
7) You will come across 4 combinations of Term Life:  
a. Regular Pay means pay for the entire policy term.  
b. Regular Pay with Return of Premium means paying for the entire policy term and getting all the paid premiums back after the policy term ends, provided you're still alive.   
c. Limited Pay (5, 10, 12, 15 years) means to pay for a lesser/limited no. of years. The entire premium to be paid is reduced by 50%. (Some policies limit their rider benefits if you choose Limited Paym like ICICI)  
d. Limited Pay with Return of Premium. (NEVER consider)  
I'd suggest you outrightly reject everything except a.  
Considering purely from an economics and Time Value of Money PoV.  
The Return of Premium (RoP) makes no sense as the amount you'll get after the policy term will be not as valuable as compared to what it is today.  
The yearly premiums will shoot up by \~1.8x if opted for RoP mode.  
E.g. You pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total   
With RoP, you pay 45k for 40 years i.e. 18L in total. You pay 8L extra to get 18L back.  
Let's think about investing. If you invest 20k extra per year (1600 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 30 years. You'll make 35L. Double!!  
Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still good. The RoR is very conservative. You can fetch 12-15% too!  
So, you PAY LESS and INVEST the overhead.  
The Limited Pay option also makes lesser sense from the same PoV. This mode will shoot up your yearly premiums by more than 2x.   
Effectively, you would be paying less than 40-50% in total. But consider the yearly premium you pay today and the same yearly premium you pay 20/30 years later. The latter will be far easier, far smaller and far less valuable as compared to today.  
Firstly, the company wants you to pay as early as possible because the more amount they get now, the more they are able to invest. They understand money will lose value as time progresses and it'll be difficult for them to generate returns later on.  
Secondly, the company doesn't have to keep worrying to get the premiums for the next couple of decades. If you pay earlier and something happens to you in the 15th year of the policy term, it will be a win-win for them because they already have all the premiums.  
E.g. In regular pay, you pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total.   
With Limited Pay, you pay 55k for 10 years i.e. 5.4L in total. Looks good? Wait.  
5.4L in next 10 years v/s 10L in next 40 years.  
So, you pay 30k extra for 10 years i.e. 3L more to reduce your premiums by 4.6L. in the next 10 years!  
Let's think about investing again!  
If you invest 30k extra per year (2500 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 10 years. You'll make 5.5L. Keep it going for the next 10-20 years. You make 56L!  
Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still better.  
8) One more point that companies make is that the longer the policy term more the chances that you may face difficulties paying the premium (you might be short of funds later). But by basic disciplined investing as seen above you can generate enough amount to pay off your premiums for regular policy terms in a very easy way.   
They also say that in the long run, you might forget to pay off the premium. Even if you miss a premium paying year, the policy is as good as dead. Solution? Switch on Auto-Debit.  
9) A limited pay exception might be the case where you can afford to pay and just want to be done with paying off the premiums to clear up liabilities.  
10) After payment (online mode) there    
is a proposal form that needs to be completed for further processing.  
11) Opting for the policy from an aggregator say Policy Bazaar looks good. They do help your kin during the claim process. IDK how efficient will they be? Another option is through the official website. And next option is third-party agents.  
12) Always opt for YEARLY payment mode.  
13) Different insurers cover different no. of critical illnesses in their Critical Illness rider. Tata(40), HDFC(19), Max(64/22 - Very expensive)  
15) The Waiver of Premium rider's premium amount fluctuates when you change the life cover amount, paying term and RoP mode. The Critical Illness rider's amount remains the same with changing life cover amount.  
16) Combining 2 different policies to achieve max. features and riders will ALWAYS cost more.   
It boils down to personal choice though.  
I hope that was helpful. Researched a lot so thought of sharing my 2 cents.

Why do some people always have to buy expensive things? Buying anything below their means is like an insult.,I think this could be looked at from the opposite perspective as well. Why do you need things that are likely nicer than what someone else has? Why do you buy mcdonalds instead of just eating potatoes and rice? Why do you need a car when a bicycle would suffice? Why buy toilet paper when you could use rags and wash them? People become accustomed to a lifestyle. Everyone has one. Sometimes i do without. Sometimes i buy the good stuff so it lasts longer. Sometimes i just like eating sushi or steak.

Is there a legitimate bull case for Gamestop (GME)?,"The real question is if there is a legitimate bear case against GME, they just recently negotiated a new 500 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks, the bankers will want to review the business plan of the company in detail, including how the company will earn revenue (e.g. growth plans in different sales channels), manage costs, and generally operate a profitable business. they want to make sure that the company will be able to repay what they lend them plus interest.

Why did Rogers stock only drop 1% yesterday?,"Did you see a drop when there were problems with the board?  That makes sense as apiece of the business; the C-Suite was in trouble.

Did you see a drop due to a network outage?  That's because NOTHING changed.  There is no fundamental problem with rogers or its product.

Canadians are about the most aphetic group of people on the planet and I say that as a Canadian.  People will bitch about the outage no more than they will bitch about the customer service or the price they pay and in the end rogers might lose a handful of customer.  Those losses will be filled with new customer acquisition in days and life will go on.

A one day outage due to user error is not a systemic business problem."

Who actually loses out from a minimum wage increase? Does anyone?,"[Initial research](https://evans.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/w23532_0.pdf) out of Seattle, where the minimum wage was raised to $13 an hour back in 2016, suggested that wages went up by around 3% but that the number of hours worked went down by around 9%, implying that the ""average"" monthly pay went down by an average of $125 per month in 2016. 

But as explained in this [follow-up research](https://evans.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/w25182.pdf), just looking at the ""average"" doesn't tell the full picture. Of those people who already had a job when the study began, minimum-wage workers with above average experience saw an increase in their earnings, while those with below average experience didn't see any significant change in earnings. 

So why was there an apparent wage drop found in the initial research? As the authors explain, that drop occurred because the rate of new workers entering the Seattle workforce ""fell significantly behind"" the rest of the state. 

In other words, more experienced minimum wage workers benefited from the wage increases. Less experienced minimum-wage workers had their hours cut so much it off-set any gains they saw from the minimum wage increase. And young people looking to enter the workforce were less likely to find employment. This is just one study, but it's some of the best research we have to date. 

If you're looking for ""other potential negative effects,"" you'd also have to consider that businesses might just raise prices to cover the wage increases.  [This](https://www.researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/38225) research found that child care businesses reported that they would raise prices or fees (in addition to reduce hours of or number of staff) to cover the wage increases, while [other research](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/1/102) found ""supermarket food prices were not impacted by Seattle’s minimum wage policy."" This isn't really surprising though. Businesses where employee wages make up more of the employer's overall expenses are going to see a bigger impact from wage increases, so they'll be more likely to increase prices and/or reduce employee hours."
"My second job hasn't paid me in two months, what are some other ways to make money?",It doesnt take two months for someone to sign a piece of paper so you can get paid.

Anyone can choose not to buy them, but there are usually lots of buyers available and the price of the bonds probably would not move too much."

An absolute idiot's guide to buying property in Australia,"After you get a mortgage pre-approval and before you look for properties, find a conveyancer or solicit first. Find one who will read section 32 for free.

Is economics a universal law?,"I will clarify some terminology first, and then gradually move on to your questions.

**Disciplines.** Economics, physics and mathematics (and philosophy, linguistics, and medicine) are disciplines or fields of study, they are not laws. Economics and physics have scientific laws. Mathematics doesn't.

**Laws.** A scientific law is the formal description of a phenomenon that occurs over and over again according to a certain recognised pattern. For example, the laws of dynamics describe the way bodies move when subjected to forces.

**Theorems.** Mathematics does not have scientific laws, because it is not a science in the strict sense of the word: Mathematical theorems hold independently of what happens in the actual world, and you cannot verify or disprove a mathematical theorem with an experiment. A theorem is a purely theoretical construct. Physics and Economics use mathematics, and its theorems, to build laws, which are then verified.

**Universal laws in physics?** From one point of view, practically all of the laws in physics are, strictly speaking, not universally true, they hold under certain sets of assumptions. For example, a projectile moves along a parabola only if it is heavy enough and slow enough that you can neglect air resistance. Even laws that are called ""universal"" are often not universal: The ""universal"" law of gravitation does not hold in the case of very strong gravitational fields, which are better described by general relativity.

**Universal laws in economics?** The same can be said of the laws of economics, they hold under certain sets of assumptions. For example, the [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) model, and the laws and definitions that come with it, work under the assumption of a competitive market for a certain good (materials that provide utility and that are mutually substitutable) with perfect competition (anyone can buy/sell from/to everybody else, and people can demand and offer whatever price they prefer), and that people want to maximise their utility. Would this apply to an alien society? If the hypotheses above still hold, then yes, the laws of supply and demand presumably will still hold. 

Of course supply and demand laws won't hold for **aliens that are some kind of insectoid hivemind**, coordinating all of their actions towards a common goal instead of attempting to maximise utility for the individual.

About your historical questions.

* Yes, ancient societies did experience inflation, see for example this article on [inflation in Ancient Rome](https://inflationinrome.weebly.com/inflation-in-ancient-rome.html).

* Yes, [ancient societies did experience recessions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4pba6b/did_ancient_economies_have_recessions/).

* Oligopolies were the norm in many pre-modern societies. For example, [guilds in the middle ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild).

All of this being said, many the of the laws of physics are arguably more universal than the laws of economics, because they require fewer, simpler assumptions.

Switzerland seems like the only country that has the tax situation you want, but the climate and cost of living is wrong.

Why didn't other oil states go the same way as Venezuela?,"The main issue Venezuela faced was not falling oil prices, it was poor economic policy. Venezuela enacted a series of policies, including funding government expenses through money creation (causing hyper-inflation), [nationalization of key industries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-nationalizations/factbox-venezuelas-nationalizations-under-chavez-idUSBRE89701X20121008), wide-spread price controls (causing massive shortages), rampant corruption, among other policies.  

While the economy didn't enter free-fall until the 2010's when Maduro was in power, it should be noted that [Venezuela was under-performing its peers economically](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268116000020) since Chavez came to power in 1999. This was in part due to gross mismanagement of the oil industry. In 2002/03, [Chavez fired thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_general_strike_of_2002%E2%80%932003) of oil industry professionals at the state oil company. In 2007, Chavez took over several major oil projects in the country (including expropriating the assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips). In 2011, he seized 11 more oil rigs. This effectively pushed out most of the major foreign investors in the Venezuelan oil industry.  Despite persistently high oil prices during Chavez's tenure, [Venezuelan oil production](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Frrapier%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F05%2FVenezuelan-Oil-Production-and-Reserves.jpg) actually declined. In comparison, Canada (a country with [similar break-even costs](http://graphics.wsj.com/oil-barrel-breakdown/)), [production increased by about 75%](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/crude-oil-production) during the same time-span.

During Chavez tenure, the Venezuelan economy was deeply reliant on high oil prices to sustain their spending--[this paper](https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/Venezuela_Final.pdf) estimated that the oil sector provided between 40-70% of government income. It wasn't enough though, government debt (as a percent of GDP) [more than doubled from 2000 to 2012](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44841.pdf).

The economic policies of Venezuela had a couple of consequences. First, even in spite of consistently high oil prices, ($90+ WTI), the economy was already faltering. The [major fall in oil prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO#0) didn't occur until late 2014, but [Venezuelan GDP/capita was already beginning to contract before that](https://imgur.com/a/mUpdtQY). Similarly, [inflation](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/VEN) was already above 60% in 2014 (it generally hovered around 15-30% per year under Chavez, which is still high in comparison to developed countries).

Second, when oil prices did fall, their government and economy was in a uniquely terrible position to deal with it. Unlike a country like [Norway which saved enormous sums of the proceeds from their oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway), Venezuela was already running large deficits beforehand and had no significant savings to draw from. As a result, Maduro financed even more of their spending by new money issue--causing inflation to reach over 65,000 percent in 2019. He also tightened price controls further, which worsened the massive shortages we see in Venezuela today."
Resenting parent that chose poverty cycle as a big “f u” to society,"Don't clean the mess. You don't have to tell them you have money of any kind, and they don't need to know your financial status. Otherwise you are going to be doing this till they are dead.

"I saved my first $10,000!!!!","What changes happened in your life that allowed you to save 10k in a year? That's $833 a month. Did you get a raise? An inheritance? Did you get rid of a partner who has costing you a ton of money?

Thats a Mighty impressive come-up from being unable to save $100. You should be very proud."
Why do Indians prefer to invest in real estate?,"There's an idea that land is an investment that keeps on gaining value over time. This is not wrong. A long time ago, before I was born, my family sold off a sizeable plot of land in our hometown, for a not insignificant figure. But now, 26 years later, a single cent there is worth almost as much as we got for that whole plot.

 I've only heard of a couple of cases where land has actually lost value over time and those were extreme circumstances.

The only other asset Indians place on the level of real estate is gold.  These aren't as volatile as stocks and aren't depreciating assets. A lot of people are comfortable with hoarding these assets so they'll ventually gain value and provide higher returns.

After a point, people become complacent, satisfied with their lives just as it is. Sentiments kick in. Then the factor of leaving an inheritance comes into play. People would rather leave properties to their children than a sum of money.

We're in the process of selling off most of our properties and you wouldn't believe the number of people telling us not to do it. We're happy with the value the property has at this point. My friends keep telling me that if I'm going to sell it, maybe I should buy some cheaper land somewhere else.  

Indians are obsessed with owning property. It's a symbol of status for us."
Should I get a prenup?,"Married two years with a prenup I asked for. My 2 cents: No one gets married expecting or planning to divorce, yet many marriages do end that way. 

The way I explained it to my husband is that we could either set up a worst-case-scenario plan now, when we are madly in love and want the best for one another…… or we can wait and if the worst happens, let the state’s default plan make decisions for us, and whatever state law doesn’t provide would have us making the same decisions at a low point in our relationship, potentially making a hard thing even harder.

In the end I think it strengthened our marriage because it required us to have challenging conversations about worst case scenarios we hope never to have to worry about.

My lawyer was able to recommend a really great lawyer to represent my husband (then-fiancé) and they made the process easy for both of us. After we signed all the papers we went and celebrated by picking up our marriage license lol. 

We did our estate planning documents last year and it was a similar dynamic though didn’t need separate representation. Hard conversations are good for a couple. If you can’t talk about money, divorce, and planning for the worst that’s a more serious issue than lack of prenup IMO"
Where are those super salaries in excess of 200k USD coming from in the US and do such opportunities exist in Europe?,"My wife (HR manager, 50) and I (Software Consultant, 55) both are independent contractors (zzp). She has an hourly tariff between 90 - 110 euro, I charge between 75 and 150 euro per hour. We both work around 44 weeks per year and try to keep it at 4 days a week (not always possible). Compared to being employed somewhere I think we earn three times more and we have the flexibility to choose our own pension, car etc. Of course the down side is finding a new job several times a year."

I'm suicidal at this point,"Hey, word of advice: DO NOT hide how you're feeling from your wife. Tell her, and be open and vulnerable. Work together as a team.

The thing is, you're trying to stay calm, but I can guarantee you that your wife is noticing that something's up - that you seem more short-tempered or tense or curt than usual. And that will indeed put a strain on a relationship. If, on the other hand, you turn to her and tell her how you are actually feeling, she will understand what's going on, and not feel rejected or held at arm's length. Trust your wife, and be honest with her."
I paid $1000 for an Adam Khoo investing course so you don't have to! (Summarized in post),"I have Fidelity and what I have found greatly useful is the information they provided.

"Dumb Question: Invest in secondary sharemarket and become millionaire, is not it scam dream","I'll have a go at answering this retarded fuckers question

Large funds have to protect their value first and foremost. This means they have to have a balance of high growth and low risk which allows them to grow slow and steady through the years, and to move capital around in order to respond to market conditions. This reduces their ability to maximise profit.  


Now, if you are a half-cooked autist looking to get rich (and I strongly suspect you might be), you can flip this equation and take on a fuckload of risk by buying unproven, new companies while their prices are low. Sure you might get wiped out, but you were already poor so that's no big loss.  


But if you hit. Then you get to make 10-20x your money, and maybe even repeat that again and again. It is very possible to turn 100K into 1mil over your life, there are many people here with 500%+ in their portfolios within a matter of years not decades. But it is not expected or even normal.   


You need a lot of research and understanding to identify the winners early, quite a bit of luck that the inherent risks don't occur, and big balls to hold through the time frames required for that risk to turn into a reward.  


Most people interested in investing should just be buying ETFs and working harder to fund more investment dollars but, hey where is the fun in that? Let's bet it all on a meme stock instead 🚀🚀🚀"

Why doesn’t the govt borrow money at the treasury bond rate and invest in an index fund with a higher average return?,"There are a few reasons for this. First, the government owning equity is very taboo, and represents a line that many argue should not be crossed. If there was a guarantee that the government would purchase equities, even in the form of an ETF, there would be a price floor created and moral hazard would be introduced. Therein, a company could act haphazardly as it would be assured that as long as it stays in the S&amp;P500, their stock price would remain inflated. 

Second, the government has no need for this. The purpose of a government is not to create profit."

"I'm a grad student and I'm on food stamps. Thanks, government! Food stamps are awesome!","I think that another thing to consider is this: in your own words, you're single, healthy, young, and WORKING. You don't fit any of the stereotypes that they expect to have fulfilled about welfare recipients. Your existence likely challenges their deeply-held prejudices about America in many ways: who deserves aid and how they are perceived, what it takes to make a living in America and who is capable of doing it, and, most importantly (and I'll bet least understood to them) that there is a class system, and it's not at ALL like the one they learned in school. You are not a bad American. They are the bad Americans, in my opinion; poor citizens that it shames me to involve in decisions that affect other human lives. But that's just my opinion, I know that character is barely a noun any more. "
I bought a house in Detroit for 15k…It is now appraised at 425k,You are in a fortunate situation. The problem with selling is finding a suitable alternative for the family. You could also consider borrowing against the equity to fund another purchase if your financial situation allows. Good luck.
Hobbyists - how much time do you spend managing your portfolio and researching companies?,"I usually spend 8 to 16 hours a week doing this, and this is already with experience. It's enough to cover 3 ~ 4 companies. I have other hobbies after all, so it doesn't dominate my life.

The length of time you analyze a stock depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you wanna go.

Back-of-the-envelope work would take me 30 minutes at most.

On the other end of the spectrum, an intense, exhaustive study would take me 2 work-weeks, and that's with something like Reuters EIKON powering my process. Don't have it? Then double that time.

I learned much later on that analysis has diminishing returns. All that number-crunching only makes your work more precise but it doesn't change the decision you'll eventually make or even move the valuation very much. Basically, if it's not an obvious buy or sell after like a few hours studying a company then it's not worth pursuing."
Why do people call Warren Buffett an “investing genius” if the tenets he follows aren’t extraordinarily difficult to replicate?,"He's intelligent across the board. His ***social intelligence*** is through the roof. When is the last time you heard him *attack a* *person*? Probably never have. I haven't. Even people who've slighted him, lied in business deals, or otherwise screwed him over.

Aside from that, he's got a long-term view and a perfect temperament. People disagreeing with his analysis rolls off his back like water off a duck. Facts and rational arguments can sway him. Emotional bargaining doesn't work.

The reason he is worth 100B and his partner is worth 2B boils down to this trust he cultivates with anybody who approaches him. They know he isn't going to go out and call them a fool, spread embarrassing gossip, or speak ill about a deal that didn't work. *That's what gives him access to incredible deals now and again.*

He's said it more than once. The ~~long-term capital management~~ Salomon Brothers debacle could have easily ended his career, and not because they might have lost money on it. Because *it could have destroyed the reputation* Buffett spent decades building.

Charlie Munger is probably leagues ahead of him in widespread intellect, and perhaps in logical reasoning as well. Then again, when someone acts like a damned fool, Charlie has no issue calling them on it - publicly.

It doesn't make him wrong, but it doesn't engender the same kind of trust.

Edit: Got my scandals mixed up, fixed the debacle in question."
Investing Question,"Investing is all about time in the market.

Have there been any successes in nationalising certain industries?,"It depends on your definition of success.

For resource allocation and business efficiency, probably not many cases would be considered positive. The state tends to use excess surplus of nationalized business to promote other ventures or some political groups can corrupt the industries to fulfill their needs.

On the other hand, if the nationalized sector is used to supply a non-profitable market, it can be a important tool on social welfare. For example, Brazil has two public banks, one of them is very active in supplying loans to the rural sector (where the private banks don't really like to get involved). The other public bank is very important to finance housing for the lower classes. Both banks could be acting in more profitable sectors (like insurance), but society profits from the existence of these banks.

So I'd say to you, it really depends on the objective of the policy-maker, a state owned industry is prone to inefficiency and corruption, but in developing nations it can be useful to provide non-supplied needs."

Should I switch to an economics major?,"econ isn’t just reading bloomberg and talking markets. most econ degrees, even something like a quant finance one, are geared towards grad school. they require a lot of math and are very theoretical. you have to also find the economics side of economics interesting in addition to the finance side of the house as well as being prepared to do some good ol’ statistical analyses. maybe sit in on some econ classes and browse through the syllabi of some courses that are required for econ majors at your school and see if you’d enjoy it"
How much were you making when you felt like 'you made it' or felt you were finally on the path to 'making it'?,"I’ve really had this experience three times, all within the past few years (for reference, the events below occurred during my early 30s, living in Denver, CO and with no student loan debt).

When I hit $75,000/year in 2017 I was finally in a place financially where I was no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck. 

When I hit $100,000/year in 2019 I was able to pay my way through my MBA program without taking out loans.

When I hit $150,000/year in 2020 I started making more money than I knew what to do with and was able to start maxing out my 401(k) with extra left over to stick in the market via a taxable brokerage account.

At this point I don’t even know what I would do with more than $150k/year, but I would probably invest it and also go on more international vacations."
DD Powerhouse Energy and other energy from waste plays,"I have nothing against your post or yourself, for your genuine concerns in wanting to warn people who maybe at risk, this proves you're a good person with good intentions and I thank you.

However, I also did some basic research into the company before investing. The basic premise of the company is not Pyrolysis so they aren't burning anything rather it's turning the plastic which doesn't get recycled into hydrogen (you make no mention of their ultimate goal of being a hydrogen producer).

You mention ""very difficult to get planning permission for an incinerator"". This is true, but they already have planning permission and are building a new site which is the reason for the recent spike, and they're not building an incinerator.

Now I watched they're presentation, and I can't remember all the figures with respect to how much plastic to how much hydrogen, I do know the technology has been around for a while but they made no secret of that, they're the first putting it into practice here in the UK.

Now you do have a good point in that supermarkets etc want to move away from plastic packaging. In the meantime though there is mountains of the stuff from all over the world and in landfill.

I invested in them because I know that Manchester and London have already ordered the next generation of public busses which will be partially to fully hydrogen powered.

What I would have been more impressed with is the research into whether they can produce hydrogen cheap enough to make it economical against competition.

I'm also not impressed by some other comments on this thread ""Thanks for giving some balance to the situation. I am in PHE but not so much I can't afford to lose it so I'll let it run.""

I mean really? Balanced, it is rather one sided, where are the pros and cons? How much money did this person throw into a company and penny stock they know fuck all about... Scary

I'm open to be convinced it's a bad investment, I'm not a fanboy or anything, I would be greatful for any information but I'm not convinced yet by your argument."
What does fatFIRE buy you over normal FIRE?,"I'm not sure many here actually are making much of a trade. A lot of the FatFIRE crowd are windfall recipients that hadn't planned to FatFIRE, it just happened.

But your question is ""What does that buy you?"", so I'll answer that:

$60k/year buys you a middling home in a lower cost of living area. You can swing a slightly nicer location if you sacrifice some things. You have one or two well kept used cars, or resale friendly new cars, that you keep for a long time because you don't want to waste money. $60k buys you budget international travel once a year if you're careful with money and prioritize that sort of thing. You have hobbies, but you try not to spend too much on them. You go out to eat, but you look at the prices on the menu. Health insurance is expensive and you're left with $10k or so of discretionary budget per year. Not bad, almost $1000 a month of fun money!

FatFIRE is at least triple regular FIRE. We'll say $200k then.

$200k/year buys you a nice home almost anywhere on Earth. Nice cities are nice. They have beautiful public spaces and the budget to ensure their residents are happy. They have services, culture, events and recreational infrastructure. As an early retiree you have the time and inclination to make use of these things. You go to concerts in the park, lectures at the university, brunch at the farmers market, because your farmers market is less of a market, and more of a social event. You live on a quiet street where no one is struggling. Most people you know work, but in this town they tend to have flexible schedules and disposable income, like you. You're not special here, and it's really nice.

And because your base expenses are only $100k/year or so, you can spend that other $100k however you please. Money doesn't buy friends, but it does throw a fantastic memorial day party, and your friends all have fun friends and they have parties and you're not often bored.

When you are bored, you fly somewhere interesting for a week, or two, because your nice town is 30 minutes from an international airport. Last summer you spent 2 months renting a place overlooking the harbor in your favorite European city. It was small, but it had a pool on the balcony with an amazing sunrise. Good wine is cheap there, and great wine is a great value, and goes with the sort of oysters you only get there and you just love them so much. The whole trip cost $20k, and that's a fraction of your discretionary budget.

You have left over money every year. Who knew it would be this hard to spend money? You under-spend your budget by 30k, 40k, 50k each year. It piles up, and you start to think of splurges. The difference between FIRE and FatFIRE isn't just having nicer things, it's having a nicer life. I'm sure regular FIRE is great too, but FatFIRE certainly isn't a burden."
UPenn analysis estimates that Joe Biden’s economic plan would cost 5.37 trillion while bringing in 3.375 trillion over a 10 year period. It also estimates that Joe Biden’s plan would decrease federal debt by 6.2% how is this possible?,"&gt; shouldn’t debt go up if the government spends more than it takes in? 

Yes, but it depends on the degree of spending. Given our insane spending and relatively low tax rates some increases might cut into the deficit. 

&gt; Additionally, those policies lower the federal debt via two mechanisms: First, lower drug prices for Medicare directly translate to a decrease in government deficits. Second, income and payroll tax revenues of those ages 60 to 64 would increase—as firms spend less on subsidizing their employees’ insurance premiums, those savings should be passed to workers in the form of higher wages over time

&gt; Taking the total effect—relative to baseline—the Biden platform as a whole increases federal debt by 0.1 percent in 2030 before decreasing it by 1.9 percent in 2040 and 6.1 percent in 2050 as certain spending provisions expire and healthcare savings and revenue boosts kick in

So in other words, it will increase debt by a tiny amount the first year, but then later as tax relief expires and other benefits given to the public and rich expire it will increase revenues from current levels and result in a lowered deficit.

Are you guys continuing to invest in MF or stocks or hoarding money for the dip?,"Think of it this way. The Nifty went down to 16800 a few weeks back. Why did you not invest then?

Either maybe you did not have the 2 lakhs then (obvious answer). Or, you were waiting for markets to go lower. The latter part is what investors do. They wait for the ""correct"" level. And then they lose to FOMO.

You already have SIPS, that's good. For the lumpsum investment, since you do not want to go conventional way by investing 50K in 4 installments, you could go for slightly different approach.

Consider today's Nifty level. If the Nifty drops 2% below this level, you invest 50K and so on. You wait and keep you money in either liquid funds or savings account till then.

When markets rise or fall, they do not do so continuously. There is a stage of profit booking. During that stage, the markets reverse for short duration. You can invest during such periods. But, you have to keep monitoring the markets atleast EOD.

Situations like the pandemic are one in a million. And I do not know why people do not understand that during period between April and August 2020, STAYING ALIVE was more important to people than investment. Yes, maybe rich people or those in IT may have excess cash. But a majority of the masses was in fear of having no money for their food or medicines. So, even if you regret not investing during that period, you should consider yourself lucky you came out alive out of that pandemic.

Regrets like this give rise to FOMO. Markets keep giving us opportunities. But these are small opportunities, not big. We wait for a big opportunity and miss the smaller ones. Finally, as a long term investor, the returns we get after many years wont make much of a difference.

Hope this helps."

INTC below $48. Is it a buy?,"Personally, I see Intel as a value trap.

All the things they're talking about doing are going to cost alot of money and time. Meanwhile competitors like AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, etc are all ascending. Intel are estimating a $1trillion market opportunity by 2030...but they keep losing market share to their competitors, so how much of that market share will actually belong to them? To turn the company around and to start competing in this field again, it's likely going to cost Intel probably 3-4x what they have allocated already for capital investments like fabs. As well, the SIZE of their new fab is directly linked to UNAPPROVED legislation and the subsidies Intel would receive as a result of Congress passing the bill. Their margins continue to decline and will decline even more with these capital investments. Intel announced at their latest earnings call that it will take at least 5 years for their margins to recover. 

There are not many tech companies and semiconductor companies that have performed as poorly against the S&amp;P 500 for half a decade like Intel has. Their technology moat is drying up. Why go dumpster-diving for Intel when there are players in the semi space that have much better fundamentals? I can't see the bull case for them at all."

To what degree is The Great Resignation a result of weaker monopsony pressure on labor?,"This is a really interesting question. There are still a lot of open questions about the labor market right now. I'll talk a bit that and what labor economists mean when they talk about monopsony in the labor market.

When we talk about monopsony, it's less an issue of there only being one or two employers out there for workers with a specific skillset, and instead that there are just a ton of frictions in finding and retaining employees-employers matches. This can cut both ways (hard to find suitable employees), but for people towards the bottom of the wage-ladder, not being able to find a job can be more dire. If you don't have savings, it might be hard to support yourself instead of taking the first available job. Indeed, measure of labor market health is quit rates. When people are confident that they can find a better job, they're more likely to quit.

 Things like expanded UI, stimulus checks, and just not going out have contributed to a [massive spike](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT) in personal savings, that can help people weather spells of joblessness. Expanded UI seems to have had some effect on willingness to work but not a ton. [Analysis](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29575) based on various states ending UI expansion early found that employment to population would be around 0.1-0.2% higher last year without the expansion. That's a lot of people, since it's a big country, but it's not driving most of the change. I haven't seen research measuring the connection between increased personal saving and the Great Resignation, but it likely plays a role. I admit that I don't know how much though. People have other reasons for not working, like not wanting to get sick, instead of just having more outside options.

One mechanism that this might work through is information. Like I said, it might be that job-seekers don't know where the best jobs for them are, and don't know their outside options. A [recent paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29623) argues that this might explain a good bit of monopsony power that employers have. This is speculation, but maybe widespread public awareness of assistance (""stimmy checks"") and news reports of other people quitting might give workers new priors about what their time and labor ""should"" be worth to them and less willing to accept subpar (but once acceptable to them) wages."

They printed more than 40% of money last year alone... what does it mean?,"No, that's not how it works. An increase in the money supply doesn't translate to an equal increase in Inflation. 

The money supply was increased so much because else *deflation* would have happened. In hindsight that goal was overshot, including for other reasons like supply chain issues, but that contributes a lot to inflation not being super high.

You also need to consider that monetary policy always aims to respond to changes in inflation. So if inflation would stay high ([and it's falling slightly already](https://www.rba.gov.au/inflation/measures-cpi.html)), monetary policy would respond and lower inflation again."

How does price action work?,"It’s an auction. When I buy I place a bid. When someone sells they place an ask. Someone has to agree to move their price (either bid higher or ask lower).

What would happen if the entire world were to unite under a single currency?,"It's pretty much the trilemma problem.  Basically, you can have a fixed exchange rate, free flow of capital, and independent monetary policy. But a country can only achieve two of this at the time. Or at the very least, every country which tried to achieve all three simultaneously has met disaster so far.  

So under this system, every country has decided to have a fixed exchange rate. This is because in order to have a global currency, the currency needs to be worth the same in every country. 

Now, the international community can either choose to allow the free flow of capital, or independent monetary policy for each country. 

Independent monetary policy involves having each country's central bank be capable of printing their own money supply. This allows for each country to set their own interest rate, which is quite a useful tool for managing your economy. 

For the previous example, the reason each country can print its own money while keeping a fixed exchange rate is because wherever a currency exchange happens, the central bank sells it's currency reserves in order to maintain the value of the currency (otherwise it'd depreciate, which would negate the fixed exchange rate). Each country's currency reserve is only so large, so capital controls must be implemented (purposely limiting currency exchange). Thus, international trade and foreign investment will be limited. That being said there are reasons why a country might want capital controls, but I won't get into that here.

The other choice is to have free flow of capital without independent monetary policy. Here the global bank has the responsibility of printing money, and thus sets global interest rates. But let's say that a country tries to solve the trilemma and sets their own interest rates as well. If it's lower than the global interest rate you'll face currency depreciation and if it's higher than the global rate your currency will appreciate. In order to preserve the fixed exchange rate must deploy your  currency reserves, which you only have so much of. 

Anyways, back on topic, not having to worry about capital controls means that  international trade and foreign investment won't be limited. But the drawback  is that you have no control over interest rates. Since you can't use interest rates to influence the economy, a country that chose the second option must rely solely on fiscal policy as a way to boost their economies. Most countries don't have much spare cash laying around, so fiscal policy often involves debt financing. Spending money to stimulate the economy is a viable tool, but when it's your only one it's easy to see how it can lead to debt crises. 

* * * 

Just a tidbit, but somebody might notice that say the the United States. The US dollar does not have a fixed exchange rate. But internally, the US functions similarly to a currency union. The states have all agreed to have a fixed exchange rate relative to each other (a dollar is worth the same in every state), have surrendered their monetary policy to the Federal Reserve. What makes this different compared to a global currency is that all the states in the US are in a fiscal union. If a certain state is suffering due to the national interest rates, then the entire country can help fund fiscal policy measures meant to alleviate it - as opposed to the single economically struggling state having to fund the fiscal policy itself. 

Something like this could happen in a global currency system too. But when you don't have a united fiscal policy, it becomes much harder to justify such measures. Thus any aid would likely be administered less proactively and in lesser scale."

The Great Resignation,"It's the natural corporate response to inflation.

Step 1: Don't increase salaries to match inflation. 

Step 2: Immediately increase prices to consumers

Step 3: Wait for some people to realise how bad things are and quit.

Step 4: Do nothing, the remaining staff will bear the burden of having to eat it. Reap in the profits. Yeah, their lives will suck, but whatever.

Step 5: Once a real boiling point is reached, they can hire new staff at current market wages but throw a crappy bone at the staff who stayed and make them think like they had a win. 

Step 6: Continue to make it taboo to talk about salary.

*Edit: My apologies, ladies and gentlemen. I forgot to mention: *

Why We're STILL Trading Sideways and Why We Haven't Launched,"&gt; SIG threw a wrench into this by objecting to SR-OCC-2021-003, thereby pushing out its finalization which would have been APR10 (45 calendar days from FEB24) setting us up potentially for this week if 004 had also been finalized but now could go out to MAY31.

I keep asking myself, if it's not required for them to go out to May 31, then why not just implement the rule *now* anyway?

Is the rise of dual income households related to why everything is so expensive these days?,"I agree with /u/zzzzz94. Also, in the long-run, inflation is all about monetary policy.

Alibaba (BABA) passes almost all of Graham's tests,"A couple of overlooked points:

1. Reddit's idea of a value play is buying a stock that has recently crashed.  This is pretty much the only way value is perceived online; the more dramatic the move, the more it is discussed. (Cue the INTC orchestra.)
2. When discussing BABA's value, there is almost no discussion on Reddit as to what BABA actually does (ie consumer-facing operations), is invested in or who their leadership is. 
3. The US stock market is booming and there is a lot of inflationary uncertainty.  There are a lot of good value opportunities stateside, but they are just humming along without much discussion, and BABA is not a particularly good inflationary hedge.
4. It's hard to accurately evaluate a company's future performance when you do not understand the company's regulatory environment.  All things being equal, the longer you play the stock, the more dangerous this gamble becomes.  Name one Chinese stock that is not susceptible to this problem.  There is no true Chinese long play.

If you're bull-trapped, I feel your pain.  Five minutes ago, this sub was shitting itself because BABA was at 192 and that was a steal.

I'm not going to sell anything to buy BABA.  As a value investor, I'm not in love with China; I'm not drawn to opportunities to fucktuple my money.

Help me understand how the FED can just print a dozen Trillion USD without any noticeable consequences,"I dont fully understand it either but when the Fed is buying junk bonds for example, its actually buying them - so while the money is coming from nowhere the fed is buying assets that it can then sell back for a hypothetical profit. So its slightly different than handing out money to people. 

The reason we arent seeing any inflationary impact are two fold, one it just takes time for prices to rise, the other explanation is that they're actually fighting against deflation / liquidity problems. 

Say I own 500 oranges that are worth a dollar and I want to buy a cow that's worth $300. I have enough wealth on my balance sheet but oranges arent liquid (or let's pretend they're not)  

So I go around lookin for someone to sell oranges to, only I cant - all the orange traders are scared of a coming recession and will only by the oranges for half price while trying to hoard dollars, now I can't buy the cow, and the cow guy cant use the money for something else. 

The fed realizes that the main reason the orange traders arent trading is because they're hoarding dollars. If the fed gets into the market then the orange traders wont be as scared. 

Hypothetically if the fed keeps doing this they'll inflate the price of oranges. In my opinion that's basically what they do with QE / interest rates anyway. Why this doesn't cause inflation anywhere is likely that the demand for dollars is still strong enough all over the world that people still want to save them. The price of dollars is very inelastic to supply."

"Why I am Ecstatic GME is Taking a Dump, and the Possible Correlation with AMC and Crypto","Yeet! OP steamrolling. Here's some more thoughts too, which makes me excited too.

I believe that the previous few days of AMC and GME going on a run are due to the shorties losing their grip and FTDs are pouring out since they've lost control on the deep ITM CALLs. Too expensive. We haven't seen those ITM CALLs in a while. FTDs are probably all starting to pour out as of the latest T21/T35. **Notice how GME and AMC have had consecutive green close days following T21? Lots of volume increase? That has never happened following a T21 this year until now**.

The shorties + banks are struggling **really badly** in the repo market trying to maintain a balance of assets (collateral) versus liabilities (loans/debts). Every day their liabilities grow and they need to keep sucking collateral out of the market in order to not default. 

Liquidity program ended March 31 now banks have much more liabilities, so the repo market has been blowing up. **Yellen now wants urgent treasury funding from congress, signaling the collateral crisis could be around the corner.**

As I side note, see how tied AMC and GME are. They are most likely losing their grip on AMC completely and putting all of their ammo into GME to keep it down. Their last breath? 👀

"Bill Gates has more wealth than the bottom 45 
percent of American households combined.","&gt;\* the stat is from 1999, so it's probably worse now, but in any case, it's a pretty big number and even if it was mostly in shares then it's still useful in a thought experiment like this.

Actually it's a ridiculously inane thought experiment, one that ignores the meanings of the statistics you cite.

To begin with, as others have cited, majority of BG's net worth is a ""calculated"" figure based on current (margin) market prices of his investments -- in 1999 the vast majority of it was tied up in Microsoft stock -- he has slowly diversified since then, but most of it is still ""invested"" in such large volumes in major holding that neither he (nor anyone else) can ""cash it out"" without that act itself causing a tremendous crash in the marginal prices of the assets being sold (which would then dramatically reduce it's total value).

**Second and even more importantly** in 1999 around 10% of the population had a NEGATIVE NET WORTH (an after the recent ""consumption decade"" and housing bubble crash -- I'd be willing to bet that figure is now closer to 20% of households.  

Which means that *anyone who had/has a POSITIVE net worth of $1 technically had ""more wealth than the bottom 10% (20% ?) of American households"" -- should we then redistribute that $1 amongst them? 

You imagine all of those people as being ""destitute &amp; homeless"" -- but many of them simply have more DEBT than they have value in their assets -- they might be living in a million dollar home, be driving three vehicles (a Humvee, a minivan, and a BMW sports car), and have so much ""crap"" that it overflows into their 3 car garage. *Do THOSE people deserve to get money ""redistributed"" from Bill Gates (or anyone else)?*

And if one EXAMINES the data on the REST of that ""bottom 45%"" -- you'll find a lot of interesting things:

For starters, a lot of fairly young people (a good 20% of households) who are in their ""early household years"" (i.e. they just bought a house within the past 0 to 15 years) are very likely to have little ""equity"" in their home (that's just the way a declining balance amortized 30 year mortgage is *supposed* to work) -- and likewise most probably do not have a large amount of savings (having and raising kids tends to cost money), and their wages are less than they likely will be later on (climbing the corporate ladder takes time). End result is that they are either still in negative net worth territory, or they are in the positive territory (and hopefully climbing) but not by a huge margin (i.e. ""cashing out"" &amp; paying off all their debts would leave them with a few thousand, *maybe* into the double digits, but not all that much higher).

Comparatively, the PARENTS of most of the people in the above very likely have either (finally) paid off their home, and/or have significant equity in it, have (hopefully) some substantial private savings, and have various 401K &amp; IRA investments as well. As a result, they have a comparatively HIGH positive net worth (at least a few hundred thousand on a ""cash out"" basis). **So, they probably have a net worth greater than say 30%... maybe even 40% of the population!** *Should we then confiscate THEIR wealth and redistribute it amongst the ""bottom"" households?*

Seriously, you're looking at a bunch of percentage figures and are NOT looking at (or thinking about) what they really mean IN CONTEXT -- i.e. when spread across the demographics of an entire nation. "

Does anyone else receive abuse in the normal FIRE subreddits,"My impression is that the normal FIRE subreddits are communities that revolve around the most likely way that ""normal"" people can hit FIRE in a broadly replicable fashion.

Consequently, they're not interested in, or are even hostile to, outliers that don't take a more traditional grind that benefits from a FIRE support group, optimization ideas, and other issues that the FIRE path involve on more common salaries.

If your household income is say $700K a year, to most people in that subreddit, you're going to hit FIRE  without sacrificing much unless your spending habits are just terrible. They might not understand why you're even there and what you can offer to them. They might think it's de-motivating to the others who don't have those options or even harmful to the cause if you're suggesting something that most people can't benefit from (e.g., active investing vs passive indexing)

It's a tough road to even hit FIRE for most people. Although the tribal misery virtue signalling can be tiresome, I admire a lot of them for sacrificing to hit it. I also think it's a great starting point for newcomers to FI so long as they keep an open mind to other paths. But I understand that it's not my crowd.

Does anyone else find that value investing has become harder and harder in this age with there being too much information and nothing stays secret for long?,"It is definitely harder than it used to be when they were young.

"Do you think governments tend to run the economy consistently with what economists / economic theory says is right, or would economists run things very differently?","A pretty classical example is the [Obama tyre tariff](https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/03/news/economy/obama-china-tire-tariff/index.html) ([see also here](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/2009-tire-tariffs-cost-us-consumers-926k-per-job-saved-and-led-to-the-loss-of-3-retail-jobs-per-factory-job-saved/)): unions and tyre manufacturers (=voters in Ohio and Wisconsin!) were *very* happy, yet it would probably have been cheaper to tax the rest of the economy and pay the gains out to the manufacturers and workers instead.

My first bot makes losing trades every second,"I'm saying this in the nicest way possible: unless you are *very* experienced in coding, maths, and financial markets, you should not pursue a bot that makes trades every couple seconds in the first place.

I know, I know, it's thrilling to see constant action on your account, but it's just not going to work. At those timescales, (i) the price action is pure noise from the perspective of a retail trader; (ii) even the 0.1% trading fee on Binance is *massive* in comparison to the magnitude of potential price movement within a couple second's time, eating any potential profits from your trades, and; (iii) the regular TA indicators based on candlestick data are just not going to cut it - you need much more intricate instruments.

You're going to make your life a lot easier if you move on to bars between 15min and 1d.

Also, I simply cannot stress enough the importance of proper backtesting with A LOT of data (years and years with several hundred trades, at least).

Cheapest S&amp;P500 companies based on adjusted PEG ratio,"&gt;First of all, the PEG ratio (Price/Earnings ratio divided by growth) is a bit of an improved ratio compared to the traditional P/E ratio as it does take future growth into account.

I feel compelled to mention despite the fact I'm almost certain you know this: You need to understand PEG as taking into account future *expected* growth. That is a very important distinction, and it's actually why my most recent approach has been the exact opposite. I've been screening for companies with *negative* ""future eps growth,"" because that term does not actually mean ""future eps growth."" It means ""future **expected** eps growth."" If you're a value investor, you're fundamentally a contrarian when compared with most of the rest of the market, which is mispricing an asset you've found value in. Don't forget that. So when you say

&gt;I had to filter out the companies with negative P/E ratios and negative EPS growth (for obvious reasons)

Don't think those ""obvious reasons"" are so obvious. A negative P/E is absolutely not a reason to filter out a company, nor is ""negative \[**expected**\] EPS growth,"" albeit for potentially different reasons. Negative P/Es can result from temporarily skewed earnings readings -- i.e. a bad quarter/bad year, i.e. potentially *exactly* the sort of situation you want to look into.  Negative expected EPS growth I've already explained -- don't be so sure about what the analysts are so sure about. If you're a Lynch reader, that should be an iron law for you.

Other than that, it's good work. Due to the limitations of most of the fundamental screeners I've seen, python is exactly where you should be to get the necessary granularity on screens. ToS is also good, if one wants to take the time to get thinkscript down.

If I could make any suggestions to refine future screens: Debt (DTE, Current ratio, etc.), Price/working capital (particularly in the international small cap world), margins (and the trend of margins), return on capital, dividend growth (i.e. is it positive and if so what is the historical cagr over the past several years), share buybacks (i.e. decreases in outstanding shares over time). Those are all important."
Why does the government bail out banks and not the account holders?,"Most governments do bail out account holders through variations of depository insurance (eg FDIC in the US or FSCS in the UK). Bailouts for banks themselves - as well as that depository insurance - tend to be so as to prevent runs on other banks, that is consumers panicking at one bank’s collapse and demanding all their money from another bank, causing that latter (otherwise blameless bank) also to collapse, and so on."

"Everything in Ethereum feels incredible right now, except for the price action","I understand that a lot of people only heard about crypto at peak mania back in December/January, and have been burned hard by the subsequent crash, but as someone who's held ETH for close to 2 years now, this price is mind-boggling to me.

When I first got into the game, the price held between $10-12 for more than SIX MONTHS.  It felt like it wasn't ever gonna move.  Then it went on a bull run, and got stuck at $42 for a few weeks.  The bull run kept going, peaked at $420 (heh) and then hovered around $300 for months.  Of course the next bull run sent it to $1400, and now here we are.

But the fact that we went from $12 being 'normal,' to $42 being 'normal,' to $300 being 'normal' to $650 being 'normal,' is mind-blowing to me.  Obviously nothing will grow at an exponential rate forever, but anyone whining about the price right now needs to take a step back and look at the big picture, instead of the 5m candles.

There will likely be a point when $1000 is the new 'normal' (and people are complaining that they bought at $2000), and then $1500, and so on and so forth."

"Why does Sweden prefer taxing income and consumption, rather than capital?","Because it’s more efficient.

I’m Brad DeLong: Ask Me Anything!,"When thinking about economic development over the long 20th century, how do you think about the role of cataclysms like the world wars and the great depression? 

I'm concerned that the cataclysms weren't incidental to rapid development, but perhaps actually necessary for it. Not because there's anything good about the misery associated with them, but rather, because the social disruption associated with them created opportunities to create new governmental and social institutions (as well as reinvent old ones). If institutions really are as critical as Acemoglu et al say, perhaps this institutional refresh can generate more development than the cataclysm prevents. Looking at our current set of increasingly sclerotic looking institutions, I'm quite concerned that they won't refresh themselves for anything shit of a 20th century level catastrophe. What do you think?"
Is being an economist (Phd level) a dying career,"Who is telling you this stuff? Calm down and ask yourself: Does anything I'm saying make sense? Even if a PhD in economics doesn't have the power, it's still relatively good compared to any other social science phd, especially for policy and industry.

&gt; If people say economics is useless then why do we even have central banks, taxes, economic appraisals and all?

I mean hypothetically, economics could be useless and these institutions only exist because of rent seeking economists trying to provide jobs for themselves and their friends. That's not true but if we're entering conspiracy land, why not. So like accept this as a strike and move on

&gt; If nothing in economics is valid even at a PhD level, then how is the economy running?

PhD economists are not required for the economy to operate. Source: human history before the 20th century (or whenever PhDs started being given out in economics). So this doesn't apply either

&gt; Are all the research papers drafted in economics just waste to do anything about policy making, industry research or solve economic issues?

Well if we assume that all economics is useless sure, this does follow that it's all a waste.

&gt; Should economics not be chosen by anyone who plans to go for a Phd in it and wants to work in the government or as economic analyst for companies?

Now here's the funny thing. Even assuming that economics and wrong and all the above things I just said are true (fwiw, only point 2 is), if you want to work in economic analysis and the gatekeepers have decided that you need a phd to enter the field, then you still need a PhD to reap those sweet rents. 

But more seriously, the answer to your question is no, absolutely not, especially relative to other fields. Even if economic theories are all wrong, you'd still have a strong statistics background and show that you understand the research process. Since quantitative skills are so highly valued by industry, as long as you can adapt you'll be fine.

That doesn't mean you specifically should get a PhD in economics though. You buried the most important sentence of your post:

To me, it sounds like you're trying to justify your qualms about your career by blaming the job market. So ask yourself these questions: Do I love economics research for its own sake? If everything ended up being wrong, would I still value the effort I put into it? Am I only thinking about this for a career? After thinking really hard about these questions for a while, click the spoiler

This is even more true for industry, doing the analyses you want to do. And maybe in 6 years your employer will pay for an MBA. None of this has any bearing on economics externally but it's all about your relationship to it!&lt;"
Did anyone quit their job in order to have more time available during market hours?,"This simply isn't sustainable.

No one can do that consistently. Before you do anything drastic, see if you can replicate those gains for another year or two (especially if we hit a bear market).

Should I get a prenup?,"I think tons more people should have prenups than do.  Then again, I’m a lawyer, so my answer to every problem is a contract.

Depending on what state you live in, a prenup may be a waste of time.  Or it may not.  Might as well see if an attorney even thinks it’s worth your time.

For example, in a community property state the situation you describe is such that you’re not going to be able to do much with a prenup because half of everything you make from the get go will be your spouse’s.

2. If there are extra charges for using credit card don't use.

3. Set autodebit right away for full payment, not minimum payment - option which your bank might have checked by default. Never err on due date.

4. Disable cash withdrawal to avoid accidental cash withdrawal. Disable international transactions if you don't need. Disable whatever else that you don't need.

5. Never exceed the credit limit. Many banks won't alert you on that or won't decline transactions (so that they can charge you for that!)

Anyone else not take their job seriously?,"I think there are quite a few people in this position.

Symptoms include:

- you report to the CEO, have no interest in being CEO (or it’s just not realistic), thus there is no promotion to pursue 

- you have a very high net worth by most standards (let’s say, $10 - 50M), you are far wealthier than you ever imagined and you now realize the marginal gain from any additional earnings is imperceptible, and you’re not motivated by status games

- on 50% of weekdays, you make (or lose) more money on you passive (pre and post tax) investments than you take home after taxes in base salary per year

- when you open your banking app on a payday, it is impossible to tell whether you got paid that day because your paycheck after taxes, is, say, $10k and your standard deviation daily in your account including investments is $50k

- you rarely learn anything new, just balancing your emotional investment in pointing out things that are ridiculously obvious given your experience versus letting people fuck up and face the obvious (to you) consequences 6 months later

- you look at your calendar each night and see it chock full of meetings the next day and are relieved to see either a couple of gaps in the schedule or long meetings where somebody else is the babysitter.  You dread the days where you have to be the babysitter for 3+ hours of meetings

- you can pretty much predict where the company will be in 6 months net of circumstances well beyond your control (eg macro economic environment)

- you fantasize about walking out, you have no desire to make any more money under the circumstances, but dread the idea of waking up on a Monday and having to figure out what to do with the rest of your life 

It happens.  Most commonly among founders or execs in companies that get acquired, you make a shitload, bang out a few years post acquisition, don’t have the energy or desire to start something new and find the status quo just bearable enough to not make any changes.

Is Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan Regressive?,"In addition to what is mentioned above, another part of the argument is that in general, most of the student loan debt is held by higher income individuals. However, Orof. Susan Dynarski had a relatively interesting and (at least I think) [convincing twitter thread](https://twitter.com/dynarski/status/1328437979614998534?s=20&amp;t=nCYEAfR1FeLvJRqd6sebLw) recently noting that while the vast majority of student loan *dollars* are held by the rich, the majority of student loan *holders* are lower income lending credibility to the idea that good targeting can reduce the regressiveness of a debt forgiveness policy. Note that this doesn’t mean that the policy is completely progressive, but the way the program is set to be administered with pell grant and income targeting up to a limit should make it far less regressive than a broad based debt forgiveness.

Producers will continue to use the platform because it’s an additional source of revenue with a larger profit margin.

Why 30-45 DTE and not weeklies?,"&gt;Weeklies pay a lower premium, sure, but the premium on six weeklies would beat one 45 day option, right? Plus you would have the flexibility to adjust week to week on your strike price.

Short DTE options have higher gamma risk, meaning the value of the options can change quickly given the same underlying price movements, compared to a longer dated option with lower gamma. In addition, a longer dated option has a strike price further away than a closer dated option if you're choosing the same delta, making it harder to breach your strike suddenly. This also means that when a trade goes against you, it is easier to roll when you are further away from expiration - it is increasingly expensive to try to convert intrinsic value of your options back into extrinsic value, the shorter DTE and the more ITM an option is. So by leaving yourself more room, both in terms of time and strike distance, you're giving yourself room to adjust.

Of course, this still depends entirely on your goal. If you're short a naked option and you really don't want to be assigned, a longer dated option is the safe play that gives your portfolio more stability. However, if you're wheeling, and buying and selling stock is part of your strategy, by all means sell weeklies. Also, with high IV, you can have a lot of extrinsic value that acts as that buffer even if it's a shorter dated option."
I made a mistake and didn’t realize the seriousness of tax. Any help would be appreciated.,"Hey folks, 

I handle this sort of thing for a living. If you're interested, I have an ongoing AMA running over on r/tax. [Feel free to post your questions over there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/pq2t2c/i_am_a_cryptocurrency_tax_attorney_ama/)

To answer OP's question, you should be tracking all of your trades and calculating your gains/losses for each taxable transaction. (Any time you trade crypto-to-crypto counts.)

If you have unrealized gains/losses, they don't count for your taxes, so if you stopped trading and the value of your assets rose before the end of the year, you wouldn't pay taxes on that value. The thing that matters is your overall *realized* gains and losses. 

If you pay taxes on your gains and the value drops, you can sell for a loss and 'realize' the losses. Keep track of these losses though since you are allowed to 'gain' back the value of any capital losses tax-free by carrying your losses forward into next year. Sometimes, if you realize massive losses, this can mean tax-free gains for years in the future. 

While it stinks to have to pay taxes in such a volatile marketplace, the good thing is that so long as you track your activity, you can write off the losses as well. 

There is software on the market for DYI crypto taxes. Ideally, you'd just plug in your wallet addresses and have everything sorted out automatically. Depending on the types of trades you made and the setup of the defi activity you participated in, some of these softwares will be pretty painless. However, I have not yet found any perfect software that does everything. As a result, you should expect some level of manual manipulation of the data to make sure things line up properly. 

182 trades isn't a whole lot of activity for a year, so even if you had to manually build those out it shouldn't take more than an afternoon. 

Given how little your USD gains were, I can't exactly say it would be a worthwhile investment, but there are also CPA's and tax firms that can do this kind of work for you. While it is always nice to know things are going to be done correctly, it isn't exactly cheap. In your case, you could possibly pay someone a couple thousand dollars to realized $4k in gains. Obviously this is not the most efficient use of your money, so it is up to you if you go this route. 

Unfortunately, this is one of those hidden costs of trading crypto. Very few projects are designed with the tax implications in mind and it makes it pretty hard to pay taxes if you haven't been tracking your activity. That being said, if you've kept everything limited to a single wallet (or a couple wallets/exchanges) it should be fairly easy to unravel after-the-fact if you're willing to put in the time."

"Holy shit. I was skeptical of all the high ceilings being thrown out until I put the pieces together. I honestly think GME is priceless, and the most valuable stock you will ever buy. Here's the full picture, as I understand it...","Incredible DD!!

With the market hitting historic highs every week and the media painting a rosy picture in the near term, it’s difficult for most to recognize the “illusion”. 

The benchmark indices (Dow, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500) are so heavily weighted in large/Mega cap companies, whose share price IMO have benefited the MOST from the hedgies naked shorting. 

Take a look at the top 20 holdings of most hedge funds. You will see mostly the same Mega cap companies. 

Are these the companies that hedgies target for naked shorting? Hell NO!!

They mostly went after small caps. Companies with shares in the $8-$20 range, that they hope to turn into penny stocks or bankrupt altogether. 

As the hedgies short synthetic shares, what do they immediately receive? CASH. 

And where does this cash go? Usually back into long positions of their top 20 holdings. 

So the naked short selling that artificially suppresses some companies (small caps like GME) had actually benefited other mega-cap company (who receive the flow of ill-gotten gains). 

This explains why there’s negative beta between GME and the S&amp;P 500.

This imminent “crash” is better described as a “reckoning” imo. 

As hedge funds are forced to pay for their sins and buy back ALL the synthetic shares they shorted, it will be the companies in their Top 20 holdings that will have to be sold off. 

And since these companies are all heavily weighted in the benchmark indices, the “crash” will seem very intense (since most people conflate “the market” with the Dow or S&amp;P performance), however I suspect that the share value of many small caps may actually rise dramatically! 

I’m curious to see how the Russell 2000 (small cap index) holds up by comparison...I suspect it will outperform significantly. 

It’s surreal to witness this. Call it karma, call it poetic justice, call it reaping what you sow. Whatever you call it, I believe we’re on the cusp of the greatest transfer of wealth in history, and GME is the catalyst. 

Of course this is not advice. I’m just a retarded ape with diamond hands and a brain as smooth as silk.

I believe the strategy of buying or transferring as many GME shares as I can from or to Computershare, holding and not selling a single GME share until the price of GME is at least 8 figures USD, and buying products from gamestop.com or brick-and-mortar Gamestop stores is the way to financial freedom and the utter annihilation of the hedge funds that have naked shorts open on GME.

Catching the Knife: The 4th Largest Iron Ore Producer in the World (FMG),"Great write up, but I think you should have discussed how low FMG sits on the cost curve, and how that (plus the vertical integration) protects them in a downturn.  Even if IO goes to sub $50USD/t, FMG can survive but the vast majority cannot.

If you agree that the world will continue to need steel, and are looking at 10 year investment horizons of global demand and urbanisation, then as far as I'm concerned it is a no brainer. 

Also, looked at the steel price this year?  Consider what happens if they start producing steel.

And if you think the best way to profit on a IO downturn is to short FMG and not the higher cost junior miners, you are a fucking moron and belong here."

"""you get $10k USD. we get 10% of your income for the rest of your life."" why dont we see this kind of contracts being made?","This sounds similar to pay as you earn loans / income sharing agreements. They exist for student loans in the US and things like coding bootcamps (and historically as indentured servitude). The difference is that those all have time limits where the loan / income sharing stops or is forgiven after a certain period of time. It's worth noting that the federal government [loses money on their pay as you earn loans](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56277). 

The problem is, as I understand it, more to do with the fact that they aren't super profitable. W/ income sharing you get adverse selection because only people who think it's cheaper to choose income sharing over a normal loan will accept your product, but these are the exact types of people who tend to have lower incomes. In your example you said you could change the parameters of the loan to combat this, but this just makes the adverse selection worse -- the pool of people who accept at 20% income sharing will tend to have lower future incomes than the pool that accepts at 10% (same goes for 30 years income sharing vs 15).

This is somewhat better w/ coding bootcamps because loaners are more assured people will enter high paying professions, but it's still a bit dicey.

There might also be some legal and regulatory questions, but that's a better question for a different sub."

Why I gave up algo trading,"quote - ""... what works today may become obsolete tomorrow. ""

this is exactly about trading and life. if it's a single formula, then the game is boring.

in systems theory, you need to develop an adaptive control system that constantly learns and optimizes your trades. before this ""algo"" can ever be implemented, it's a combination of how your brain and emotion works.

even the great jim simons thought about giving up but continued and he has been successful.

so the winning formula is: DON'T GIVE UP (learning)

I can tell you as someone who worked in woodwork, then the military, then owned my own business, then went back to school on the GI BILL for a STEM degree: You can make decent money in a lot of professions. You can also have miserable working conditions and that money isn’t worth it.

Just like asking “what degree do you have” ask tradesman claiming well above average annual per DOL statistics: 

“How many hours per week do you work?”
“What conditions do you work in?”
“How often do you travel”
“How many years have you been working at x company, and in x trade”

Why did the USSR collapse so spectacularly when their Debt/GDP was only about 3%,"This a fine question, but it's largely suited for a different sub (/r/AskHistorians might be able to provide detailed answers to some of your questions). Economics certainly played a role in the downfall of the USSR, but it's nowhere near the whole story. There were lots of political and social factors (both reflecting why parts of the country wanted to break off, and why Gorbachev let them break off) that are better explained elsewhere.

I'll just provide a brief summary of some of the economics for the time being—hopefully one of our more knowledgeable users can provide more details later. The collapse of the USSR was not due to debt, but they did have their economic struggles. After some [rapid growth from the 30s through 60s](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-maddison-2020?country=~OWID_USS), growth stagnated starting in the 1970s. For the last ten years of their existence, real GDP per capita grew at just 1% annually, and remained far below levels seen in developed countries (like the US and Western Europe). This was one factor behind increased discontent and desire for change/reform.

As for why economic growth stagnated, there are a number of theories. If I have more time later, I can dig up some of the papers on this. However, there doesn't seem to be any strong agreement, largely because of poor data quality and availability. The USSR didn't measure the same economic indicators as most countries do today, and much of the economic data they did collect was false to varying degrees. Even today, it makes studying the USSR challenging.

First Personal Goal Reached at 16 Years Old,"Compound interest is incredibly powerful - keep investing, and keep re-investing your returns, and you’ll do better than most people

An extra 10 years of investing can more than double the final amount you end up with over 25-30
Years, even with less money invested - I wish I’d started at 15.

Even if you don’t invest any more money and the stock price doesn’t go up, by the time you’re 25 you’ll have $1500 or more before most of your peers even think about investing. Add an average of $50/mo and you’ll have nearly $10k"
Journey to 1M (12/40),"I like your thinking and this is a pretty fun and productive way to gamble with $1,000. More fun than dumping it on a badminton multi anyway.

I'm trying to do something like this although with much more modest gains. I started with $5k and have a couple of penny stocks that are reasonably stable but go up and down a few points consistently. My strategy is to set a buy at the low mark with a take profit at ~10%. Rinse and repeat. You have to be really patient because sometimes the marks don't get hit for a week or two, and you're only making $300-$500 at a time.

If the $5k is worth $6k by the end of the year, I've probably beaten most of the clowns in Ausfinance.

No technical analysis involved (it's bs imo), just looking at the min/max daily price and going with my gut."

Why invest in rental properties instead of the stock market?,"As an investor, I firmly believe real estate is safer than the market. Then covid happened. But I still believe that. Appreciation is also fickle - try not to use it in your calculations. For me, it's about scalable cash flow. My first property, I put in 15k cash and it has been sending me $400-$700 a month for years. It's also doubled in value in 6 years. Go figure.

My next property? 50k in, and it hands me 40k a year. I can't do that on the stock market.

My next one after that? $0 in (I leveraged equity from the one before by increasing the loan, effectively doing a cash out refi if you've heard the term, without actually doing one... Real estate is complex, but the point is I put in no new money from my personal bank; just used loans). That property, after all debt and CapEx and maintenance savings, would have made 20k this year without covid. With Covid, I'm not sure yet, but likely 5-8k, which is still good for my $0 investment.

Another one, I put in 4k to buy, and I'll spend probably 5k to remodel, and I'll sell it for 30k more than I bought it for, or keep it and make a modest $200 a month. 

My litmus test, and I am not a normal investor, is that whatever cash I put into the project, I get back out by 2 years. After that, it's just profit. It's less about rate of return, because sometimes they are too high to bother calculating it, and more about that return period for me.

You are missing, perhaps, the value and safety of a monthly cashflow with each property, achieved through the use of very little cash, over and beyond the loan term for a buy and hold investor, vs a flipper for example. That first property of mine will hand me around 2k a month when it's mortgage is paid off. Or I leverage the equity instead to buy more property for more cashflow each month. My original 15k cash leads to that $400 to $700 a month, but can also lead to another $1,500 a month if leveraged for other purchases. Real estate can snowball into more real estate in a way stocks do not generally do unless you are very very lucky.

And I love being able to touch and see my investments, just as a personal note."

"Will an investment of $140,000 be worth $9,300,000 in 45 years?","Yes, you calculated that correctly. 7-8% is a fair yearly estimate. All long term saving/investing is pretty simple math. The bigger issue is that we tend to value our current needs over our future ones more. Let’s say 5 years from now you want to get married, you want a house, you want a nice car etc. Are you going to pretend that your investments don’t exist knowing they could make a substantial impact on your physical situation? Are you willing to live cheaply knowing you can live “better”? Most people are not. They will quickly inflate their life to match what they perceive they deserve at that moment. They will spend the money at some point along the way. You can absolutely hit that number, but it requires years of putting off gratification for more opportunities down the road."
Just to put things in perspective (and reassure those who are panicking),"After DAO hack i saw the mood was way more depressive than now... lost all the unrealized profit in just 1 day.

Im seeing that this time it will recover faster due to few great events that are expected in this year to happen."
"I just realized that if I dump most of my remaining cash into my existing stocks, I will be $12k in annual dividends (around $7k now).","The extra cash on hand is already losing money, because your savings account rate can't even match inflation.

If you're worried about choosing the wrong stock, find a mutual fund or etf."
Few investors cared about fundamentals in the last couple years. The market is not efficient.,"In bull markets people care about sentiment. In bear markets people focus more on fundamentals. Many investors have never known a bear market, since for several years there has been a long bull run, where you could just throw money at meme stocks and watch the gains come rolling in.

The middle class makes stupid financial decisions. Should personal finance be tought in school?,"I would agree that the *majority* of the middle class make ""stupid"" financial decisions; but I think your selection of what you consider ""stupid"" is in itself rather stupid, since it fails to distinguish the broad spectrum of costs and mistakenly *assumes* that all ends of spectrum are at equal costs, and further *assumes* that everything is apparently financed, to wit:

&gt; + Buy/maintain a car, even when they still pay rent, and regardless of whether moving closer to their workplace would be cheaper. Walking to work a mile or two has become inacceptable.

This really isn't one statement, but a grab-bag and mixture of several. Let's parse it out:

+ **Buy/maintain a car** 

This in and of itself may not be ""stupid"". We have a whole spectrum here, from the one end which may be quite WISE: an individual who buys an inexpensive used car in good condition for cash, and then maintains it in an optimal manner; to the opposite end which is very STUPID: an individual buying a brand new, expensive ""luxury"" brand-name vehicle, and financing it to the maximum of their credit carrying capacity (IOW, they buy the MOST CAR {$$} that they can possibly afford to get a loan on, with the goal of ""appearing rich"" to family/friends/strangers.)  

You also fail to include the HIGHLY IMPORTANT ancillary costs -- namely INSURANCE -- which further distance the WISE from the STUPID end of the spectrum. The driver of the paid-for used-car will probably purchase only medical/liability insurance (which is relatively inexpensive), whereas the buyer of a ""brand new financed car"" will be *required* to also purchase full collision/replacement coverage (which can often be more expensive than the car itself).

+ *Buy/maintain a car* **even when they still pay rent**

This one is a total non-sequitur. *Everyone either has (or will have) housing costs,* whether in the form of rent or home payments, and/or property taxes. The only exception would be those who ""mooch"" their housing FREE from friends/relatives. Indeed probably the most ""stupid/irresponsible"" individuals are the ones who buy ""the MOST CAR"" (luxury/new &amp; on payment plan) when they are NOT paying rent/housing costs, since they are almost certainly allocating not only the ""transportation"" portion of their income, but also the ""rent"" portion -- and they are the most likely to default on (or at least face financial trouble with) their car payments (especially when their housing situation changes and they DO need to begin paying for ""home/shelter"").

&gt; + *Buy/maintain a car [...]* **regardless of whether moving closer to their workplace would be cheaper.** Walking to work a mile or two has become inacceptable [sic, I believe you meant ""UNacceptable""].

This one has some validity -- but with an important caveat. In recent decades, peoples' jobs have become much less ""stable"" (or ""reliable"", ""permanent"" etc) in the sense that often one cannot expect to get and retain a job working where one will be working for *the same company at the same location* for any predictably long period of time.

Frequent moving (whether renting or owning) also has associated costs in terms of both money AND time. In rural areas, small towns, small cities, and even high-density metropolitan areas distance from one job to another can often be significant (far more than ""a mile or two""), and just as frequently the job are clustered in an area where housing accommodations are minimal (and therefore often expensive, or alternately poor in quality if inexpensive) -- conversely inexpensive/higher-quality housing is clustered in a different area. (And in many ways various American government policies in the form of ""zoning laws"" are to blame for this -- separating commercial/industrial ""zones"" FAR away from residential ""zones"" -- though one could argue that such zoning is just a codification of previous human behavior patterns.)

This is NOT to justify the ""two hour commute"" where individuals CHOOSE to live in a remote housing area, when many other acceptable (and far closer) housing areas are available.

Regardless, for all but a small percentage of the population, ""walking to work"" is quite often NOT a viable option. (And if/when they DO manage to relocate their housing closer to their job, that job just as frequently moves or disappears altogether and they find themselves equally distant from the new job/work location.)

Finally, one's housing location is NOT simply a ""bed"" near one's work -- it is also a location for one's family (distance to school, spouse work options) a location for one's other necessities (access to food &amp; other stores), and for one's social support network (nearness to family, close friends, church and other social groups, etc.) which are often have a far more long-term two-way commitment to people than their ""job"" does (i.e. ""jobs"" can fire &amp; lay-off people at a moments notice and contrary to a person's choice or plan -- one's family, friends, and social groups tend to be changed in a major fashion ONLY by the choice of the individual).


**Sum total** whether one SHOULD have (or indeed NEEDS to have) a vehicle is a highly individual equation, one that will vary not only from person to person, but which may change dramatically throughout periods of a person's life.

---

&gt; + **Rent, when buying is cheaper.** 

As others have noted, this is a complex equation -- it involves not only the straight month versus month costs, but also long term personal plans as well as long term economic situation. (In your ""car"" statement, you posit that people should instantly MOVE to within walking distance of any job -- in many cases this would be a financially STUPID action to take, ESPECIALLY if they OWN rather than RENT -- because each time one buys/sells a home, the realtor and other fees are a significant expense {upwards to 10% of the transaction/house price AND may represent the loss of an even higher percentage of the owner's equity} other than in the recent ""bubble"" of seemingly ever-increasing house prices, frequent selling &amp; buying of a home [esp. under the ""pressures"" of NEEDING to move for work reasons combined with an INABILITY to commute because you are sans-car] are a path to the poorhouse.)

---

&gt; + Buy insane amounts of gadgets/stuff.

Again, there is a WIDE spectrum here, and ""insane amounts"" is a highly subjective phrase (what I, as a highly frugal person, might think is an ""insane"" amount may be significantly different than what you or some other person considers ""insane"").

The individuals who HAVE TO HAVE the latest, greatest and most expensive ""top of the line"" gadgets the moment they are introduced (and then purchasing new again and again as each successive gadget is introduced) -- and then WORSE who purchase all of these things on revolving credit -- are indeed STUPID.

But, other individuals who are capable of ""controlling"" such purchases -- delaying gratification and without the need to be a ""first adopter"" (aka ""fool"") of every new tech gadget -- and can await and purchase a much more moderately priced ""mid-range"" model when the second or third version/iteration comes out -- and especially who then are making their purchases with CASH (i.e. no financing cost)... *are another story altogether*. (Yes, the purchase may still have little or even no ""utility"" in their life and be simply a wasteful ""entertainment"" item -- but the impact on their financial situation will be minimal).

---

&gt;Until you own your own place, owning a car and buying non-essentials should be off limits (unless you need a car for health reasons or something). **Personal finance needs to be made a part of basic education.**

I certainly agree with that last (bolded) sentence.  And to my mind, while the previous sentence DOES contain a good ""rule of thumb"" when combined with your other statements, it is rather nonsensical, and all it serves to do is prove that you yourself are probably in desperate need of some additional thought/learning when it comes to ""Personal Finance"".

"Daily General Discussion - November 30, 2017","So now we can confirm that BTC has finished their amazing bull run, from the Bottom $5400 to the Top $11440. Now it is time for BTC to correct, I think it will take 3-4 weeks in this phase. The bull trap earlier confirmed that there are no big sharks with BTC anymore, only small fishes involved, price move up with small volume, move down with greater volume.                                                           

**For ETH**: We have a very solid support at $400 and $350. At this time BTC still get all the attention because people still hope the bull run has not stopped, but they will change their mind eventually.                                                  
                      
**For the Ratio**: Since ETH is just a follower at the moment, the ratio look bad, but it will be improved soon. Remember we have solid support at 400 - 375 and 350 when BTC has only support at 8000 (due to its fast rally). So in the worst case, if BTC test support at 8000, we test support at 350, the ratio is still 0.04375, which is at least better than now. In the better case, if we can hold at 400 when BTC test 8000, the ratio will be 0.05, much better than now. At the best case, ETH price stable or even increase when BTC continuess their correction, our ratio will look much better.

**For reference**: Remember our bull run from 01/2017 till 06/2017? At some points BTC corrected hard, but our bull still continue, just look at the chart of ETH/BTC to confirm my words.                                      

*Edit 1: Additional information:*

The reason I think BTC topped at $11,400 is due to the **selling behavior** of the big money. When BTC bull run from 9000 to 10000, they tried to sell at the best rate. For example, there are 2 to 3 buying wall 9555, 9554.96, 9554.95, and 1 selling wall at 9555.01, all are moving up when price moving up. The selling war is just about 10-30BTC and it continuously refill at some points. The strategy is to make small fishes like us have to buy directly to the selling wall if we want to buy BTC, and since it was a bull run, fewer people dump their BTC to the multiple buying wall.

And what happened yesterday? The seller dumped BTC directly to the market, and they dumped the whole 1000 BTC in 1 minute, and continuously dump more to make the price down. Logically no one will do that in a bull market unless they planed to get out asap or something was wrong. No bad news after the dump, even BTC had good news with Nasdaq plan bitcoin future.  The rebound was pretty weak which again confirm that big money moved out of BTC. Of course it is just my personal analysis based on my trading experience, I may be wrong, but I hope I was right this time. BTC was too hot recently, it needs to cool down so others can rise."

Why do people post their projects on Github?,"My take, based on being an institutional trader for basically a decade...

Double edged sword: They want recognition and potential collaboration while building a portfolio of sorts for future job prospects.... but in the process, they expose their own ideas to a highly competitive industry (trading) and as they gain industry experience you'll see the types of things shared to be more and more specific and restrictive.

Examples:

Someone in their first few years of programming and algo trading, either just finishing up school or has been self learning online:

&gt;*""""""Look at this open source trading algo I wrote! Suggestions and colab welcome!""""""""*

Someone after 3-4 years of industry experience, realizing that random strangers online aren't the best collaborators, and most algos posted publicly seem to turn to shit if there was any edge at all to begin with... They are also considering just getting a corporate development job for a steady paycheck:

&gt;*""""""Look at this code I wrote to implement this academic paper I read the other day. Also, here's an analysis on my Medium blog, and I'm just gonna post my LinkedIn profile in the footer.""""""*

Someone after 5-6 years+ of algo trading industry experience, who's finally turned profitable after the first few years of struggling and is starting to understand algo trading isn't all just math and you need to actually understand market microstructure and have decent domain knowledge of the products you trade:

&gt;*""""""Look at this messaging library I forked and modified to better manage binary data sent between nodes in a distributed system. It solved this problem I had when algo trading. You could use this as one of many building blocks in your own trading stack.  ... What? No, no I won't release my full trading stack to the public... no, I won't talk about my strategies... Jeeze guys, this messaging library is actually really cool, why do you only care about my P/L?""""""*

If you read this post backwards, you'll discover why 99.9% of the open source (or at least public) code for trading algos, and heck, even full trading stack implementations, are going to be junk... but at least it looks good on a resume when the inexperienced coders who make them eventually give up and try to get a job.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 31/May/2017,"Good morning from the UK 🇬🇧 

Forgot about the price for a second guys, I think we all need to sit back and reflect on the last 24 hours...

We broke ATH's on both fiat and against bitcoin. Bitcoin was tanking as ETH was rocketing, the flippening is real... There is no doubt about it that ethereum is going to be a market leader. The write up on OKCoin couldn't have put it better, move with the times bitcoin or get left behind. The ratio is the real number we need to be making gains on to separate ourselves.

We recovered from 110 back into the 200's in less than 48 hours. I hope the lesson wasn't too costly to anyone selling near the bottom expecting to buy back in cheaper. The only safe proof plan is to hodl and has proven time and time again with this volatile market. 

I said in March that I'd be happy at $100 by the end of the year, it's blew every expectation out the water.

Feeling like a proud parent to ethereum right now. June will be a very big month for ethereum, now that China are on board, the bitcoiners are starting to see the light, more companies joining the EEA and metropolis.

Enjoy your day guys and girls."

President Biden wants to increase the Corporate Tax Rate to 28%. Is this good policy?,"Chari and Kehoe (1999) is a pretty thorough introduction to the idea of corporate taxation. If you want to read it, you can probably skip the math and focus on what they say about their results. They find that capital income tax should be roughly *zero*, because this distorts the ability to invest for future growth (I think the original result is from Chamley (1986)). 

However, a recent paper from Straub and Werning (2020) seems to run counter to this idea. I’m not very familiar with the paper since macro is not my main field, but now that I’m mentioning it here I’ll probably read it over the weekend, because corporate finance is something I’d like to get into. 

Anyways, you certainly *can* over-tax corporations if it forces them to later distort their investment. The difficulty is that firms do not use all the capital they accumulate for investment- additional funds become bonuses or dividends, for example."

NAB locked &amp; emptied my whole account ??,"I don't usually reply to posts like this but you are 16 years old and there is some truly terrible advice being thrown out by people who don't understand what they are talking about. Though admittedly also some good info and advice mixed in.

For context: I have over 10 years banking experience, 7 years of which has been spent in some financial crime capacity, currently employed in financial crime at an Australian bank (not NAB).

I'll try not to rehash too many points that have already been made. 

Based on your description and actions taken by NAB they likely saw the funds come in from a third party and then quickly be distributed to various other third parties and believed this was proceeds of crime, likely from a scam or cybercrime as this is the most common these days. They've asked you to identify yourself in person as part of their Enhanced Customer Due Diligence process. A lot of this type of criminal activity is completed using profiles with stolen identities so they wanted to check that you are who you say you are and not some criminal in India using the stolen identity of a 16 year old Australian kid.

The fraud team are likely investigating the funds transfer you received from your friend as their first instinct will likely be that your friend is a victim of a crime that resulted in you receiving stolen funds from their account or barring that your friend is another chain in a link of accounts moving proceeds of crime. Unfortunately your friend's bank may take some time to investigate on their end before advising NAB they've confirmed with their customer the funds transfer was legitimate and that they have no concerns about the activity on their end. Your friend may be contacted by their bank to verify their transfer to you. The funds you received from them will likely be made unavailable to you until they get this verification, in case they are stolen funds which NAB will want to return to the victim.

You've received some pretty crappy service and communication, not gonna lie. If that interaction  with the branch manager is accurate, that is highly problematic for them. Trying to contact a major bank by phone is always a nightmare unfortunately. Hopefully someone competent picks up your case, reviews all of the information available and makes an informed assessment which resolves your situation.

Responses to some of the 'advice' given:
1. You do not need to engage a lawyer at this time.
2. Never intentionally structure transactions to be under $10k. We specifically design monitoring strategies for this and structured activity is generally considered more suspicious than just doing large value transactions.
3. The $10k reporting is only for certain channels, mostly cash. All of these transactions get reported, not all of them get investigated. It's mostly just for data gathering purposes to have the info available should it be useful to a criminal investigation in the future. Domestic transfers have no reporting obligation but can still flag for review but won't be investigated unless something other than the value makes it look suss (such as forwarding funds received from a third party to various other third parties).

I understand your frustration and if you are legitimate (which I will give the benefit of the doubt) then I sympathise with your position. If you need any advice dealing with the situation as anything new comes up, feel free to DM me and I'll share what I can.

Good luck, hope it gets sorted out quickly."

"When heading into Black Friday sales, it's not a sale if you didn't plan to buy the item in the first place.","I disagree...kind of.

I drink a lot of whiskey.  So much that I generally know the market price for specific bottles if someone asked me.  I just bought 4 bottles of something I like that had a flash sale for like 35% below market value.  That was for something relatively inexpensive anyway, but something I already enjoy and do drink.  Another purchase was a for a 25yo whiskey that was under 25% it's market value.  I generally wouldn't have bought that because of the price, but it was almost like a white whale price, if that makes sense.  I'll never see it that low again, and I will savour it on special occasions.  

If you buy something frequently enough throughout the year, I don't think there's any problem in going for stuff in these sales if it's a massive discount.

What is Turkey's rationale for devaluing their currency and cutting rates?,"Erdogan is just wrong. The mainstream line of thinking is that increasing interest rates reduces aggregate demand, thus reducing inflation. This has, for the most part, led to quite successful inflation targeting by independent central banks (the last 1-2 years being the exception of course). Erdogan decided this idea is wrong, that higher interest rates actually *increase* inflation. Some of his advisors have referred to outdated, heterodox economic theories. Erdogan has also at different times offered other explanations, such as referring to Islamic teachings against interest.

Regardless, none of us know exactly why he's doing this, but it doesn't isn't based in modern economic research."

One additional factor is about the value of your time. My dad was a landlord for 20 years and there were a lot of late night phone calls about the tenants making noise, one guy even tried to steal and sell the lead off the roof and that was a whole thing. Granted they did rent to students which was a bit chaotic.

My point is that all the housing stuff is going to be a big time sink for you, same with value investing. And refurbishing sounds like a lot of stressful phone calls.

Whereas if you buy a ""set and forget"" index fund then you could use that spare time to use your programming skills to get an extra income.

Does anybody else find being poor absolutely exhausting?,"There was a recent study which found that poverty reduced IQ by 13 points (that’s a ton).  Those running the study said this drop wasn’t explainable by stress or time availability.  Below is a quote from the article I read:

The Intelligent Investor: Market fluctuations - the most important chapter according to Buffet,"Nice write-up. The only thing I disagree with him about is that business value and fundamentals are all that matter when evaluating a stock for purchase. They are the primary things that matter, but unless the market is some magical meritocracy where rational actors pick good stocks over bad for no other reason than formula check boxes, it’s a silly mindset to assume that retail investors have or should have.  

Opportunity cost is a thing. And it is not a meritocracy, it is a supply-demand marketplace competing for popularity and volume on a fiscal quarter timescale. No rational actor karmic wheel righting the rights and wronging the misguided for x or y balance sheet line item. Expectations, sentiment, and forward-thinking all matter a great deal. Otherwise he’s right on.

*Edit to add TL/DR: 
The “accounting only” argument he makes is wrong. Other things matter in the appreciation of share price besides financial performance of the company. 
-	Company and stock are two different things. They just are. 
-	Good numbers are necessary, but not sufficient. 
-	The market is not a rational actor
-	There is nothing inherent in the market that requires market value and intrinsic value to ever accurately match up."
How worried should I be if the Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling and the USA defaults?,"No, no, possibly yes, no.

It's political theater. It occurs on a regular basis, with both parties. They will wait until the last moment, and some compromise will be made. One side will say the other side is risking the global economy, the other side will say the first side is being irresponsible spenders. Both will be correct, and switch places in a couple of years.

This is about raising the amount of debt the US is allowed to possess. It has to deal with new debt more than old debt. If the US goes one penny over the debt limit, the Treasury will not default on all existing debt. They will only be able to issue new notes (debt) on par with notes that are redeemed (paid off).

This limits deficit spending (ie paying more money out than you collect in). Theoretically the US government could reduce its interest payments rather than reduce its services or payments, but that is unlikely. As stated, a last minute compromise is the most likely outcome. Worst case, checks cut by Treasury are delayed. 

America has so much debt because it can borrow insanely cheaply. The reason why is that folks know they will be paid.  If you want to accurately gauge the real likelihood of default, look at the Treasury note interest rate. If it spikes heavily, you will know that investors believe a default is even remotely possible. Currently rates are around 1.5% for a 10 year note. 

[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield)

If you look up Agentina's rates, it's 49%. Which means investors are pretty sure they will default and want the rates to justify the risk.

General question but why is trickle-down economics laughed at alot in online circles? Is it a bad theory now?,"Trickle down isn't really an economics argument. It's a political argument. The term was coined by a comedian in the 1930's to describe President Herbert Hoover's stimulus package to big corporations during the Great Depression. It has then been used to describe any tax break, or favorable government initiative, for large corporations. 

In my opinion, the best way to think about economics is to acknowledge that every action is a trade off. Trickle down is a vague description for a value laden set of policies, it isn't really an economic paradigm in and of itself.

I think that due to its political nature, it is easy to be targeted. In one way or another most governments have provided support for large corporations they deem vital to the ""national interest"". The overall efficacy of those indirect and direct subsidies towards raising public welfare are most accurately analysed on a case by case basis."
Would it be foolish to get $20k+ worth of dental work done at this stage of my life?,"You're like 30% of the way into what is hopefully a very long and productive life.

"Congratulations on your ""depreciating asset"" OP","I think the reason people give replies like that is that a lot of people who got rich with ETH have never had money before.    If you make $75K in ETH, and sell it and buy a $75K car, you will have no money and no car soon, because expensive cars require expensive upkeep and insurance.

Instead, people should treat their ETH gains as a potential income stream.   If this income stream supports the expensive car, awesome, congratulations.

There is a reason 95% of lottery winners are broke in a few years, and the same is true of many people who get rich quickly.   While any particular car purchaser may be responsible, in general, buying expensive cars is a horrible financial decision, and with all the new money in crypto, many of these people will not be responsible.

When does real estate become worthless in Miami?,"Assuming we know the end date of the usefulness of something with 100% accuracy, then its value would begin dropping immediately, since we'd know the exact time until it's no longer useful. The value would decrease further until the property reaches some hypothetical end-of-life date (i.e., it's underwater). 

The property still has use in the mean time, of course, which is why people continue to buy property with less longevity than, say, something inland. I would say that the longevity of many waterfront properties is already baked into their price.

Economists use [discounted utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_utility) to determine the point at which the property is no longer desirable, though such a point is subjective between consumers. Essentially, this is the comparison between the value of getting something immediately versus getting it at some time in the future. This can be used to determine the preference of owning beachfront property now and losing it later versus owning inland property now and later."

Thoughts on this deal. Paid 200k for raw land around 6 years ago. I have an offer to sell for $700k. Proposal is 25% down with owner financed and remainder paid over 12 months. It’s a larger parcel with mature timber. Only downside that I can think of is buyer clear cuts and runs after paying 25%,"If the timber is a significant part of the intrinsic value of the land, then you are right to be concerned about him cutting and defaulting, leaving you having to foreclose on barren land worth a fraction of what it was worth previously. 

If it were me I absolutely wouldn't take that risk and owner finance the deal. Let him either come with cash or secure some other form of financing."
"Agent recommended I sell off-market, only weeks later sells a unit in my building (same layout and floor) for $200k more at auction. I find out later he had an existing relationship with the buyer of my unit.","It sounds dodgy the way you have interpreted it, but consider:

1. If the ""relationship"" between the agent and the buyer is just prior business dealings in their role as a real estate agent. For example, the agent has sold to someone already on their database (remember it was an off-market sale, so this is to be expected), versus selling it to a family member or a business partner where the agent will profit beyond the commission that you are paying them.
2. If the price that you received was fair market value. Forget the other place that has since sold for $200k more, what were other similar places in your area selling for in the weeks leading up to when you sold yours? What did your agent estimate when you initially selected them, what price ranges were other agents quoting?

If your place sold for $200k less than comparable properties at the time, then you might have something more to investigate. If however someone has just overpaid on the other place by $150-200k then you don't. Did your sale price seem fair/good at the time, or were you severely beaten down on price by the agent (by the magnitude of $100-200k) compared to what they initially told you it would sell for?

The value of the apartment is also a large missing part of the story here. $200k means something very different on a $400k sale versus a sale of $2mil.

I wouldn't rule out that someone has just paid overs on the other place due to FOMO and competition. We don't know anything about the other marketing campaign and how many potential buyers were involved.

This is just my rational view stepping back without having all of the facts."

"If a billionaire never spends his money, does the economy lose 1 billion worth of value?","I think you are confusing value and money. Most of the time, If Bill is worth 1.1B, that means that he owns things worth 1.1B dollars. This could be stock, land, buildings, beanie babies, etc. When he dies, the ownership of those things changes, but how those things are used doesn't neccesarily change.

If Bill liquidated all of his assets, then someone would have to buy those assets, who would then not spend that money on other things. Now, Bill could spend his money on things that would create more value for the economy than the things he previous owns created (Investment worth more than what he previously owned, some charities, or any product which has a positive externality), or less (buying land in major cities and holding it, producing a lot of air pollution, anything with a negative externality ), but the act of spending it doesn't by default create any value.

If Bill had somehow kept all of his wealth in cash, then not spending his money would be very similar to burning 1 B dollars, and then printing 1B when he dies. While the money is out of circulation, money would be worth a little bit more for everyone else than it otherwise would be, and after it would be worth a little bit less per dollar (at least that is the theory as I understand it)."

Power to the players."
My city in Canada (Toronto) is implementing a vacancy tax. Is there an argument that a vacancy tax could reduce the long run supply of housing?,"Realistically, no, a vacancy tax will not have a meaningful impact on long run housing supply. If anything, I'd bet that the initial increase in ""activated"" housing stock more than covers any change in housing construction.

The TLDR for people is that:

1. The marginal direction of vacancy taxes on housing supply might be correct, but the impact is also very, very marginal such that I don't think you could differentiate it from zero
2. Any marginal change to construction is very likely dominated by the vacancy tax increasing effective housing supply by bringing vacant homes to market
3. Long term studies in cities are very hard

The longer answer:

&gt;A marginalist argument would be that the percent of time a home is likely to be occupied decreases with housing supply

This is true, but the effect is going to be tiny. Most vacancy taxes apply to housing that is vacant for a significiant portiion of the year -- in Toronto the portion is six months. Even in markets with really high vacancy rates most rental housing isn't typically vacant for half the year, which means if it's off the market it's usually intentional in some respect (second home, dillapidated house, renovations, legal issues, etc.).

So the kind of project this would discourage is one where the market thinks that there's a high chance a property would be vacant for most of the year -- people's second homes is probably the most immediate example. How much does the marginal discouragement of the construction of housing units intended to be lived in semi-frequently matter for overall housing supply? Probably next to not much. You also hear stories in places with rent control where a landlord will hold units off market instead of locking in low-rents during a recession. 

In theory, a vacancy tax makes holding rental housing less profitable but again the effect size is not going to be meaningful.And this marginal discouragement of construction is weighed against the fact that these ""intentionally off-market"" homes are the kinds that get brought to market when a vacancy tax gets passed (and vacancy taxes do work in reducing vacancies and bringing homes to market).

As for empirical studies, the short term effects of vacancy taxes are pretty clear: [they reduce vacancies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272719301409). As for long term effects, you could certainly check back in to France (the place from the paper I cited) in 50 years and see how low vacancies are in places with the tax, but a study about how much long-run development was discouraged by a vacancy tax would be really hard.

These kinds of ""what's the effect of X on Y"" studies are based around the idea of approximating a randomized control trial: these two cities are very similar, but one passed a vacancy tax and the other didn't, let's follow them and see what happened. You could look at the long term effects of vacancy taxes on vacancy rates because there aren't thaaaattt many things that effect vacancy rates, and the overall rate tends to be pretty stable over time (note, I am not talking about rental vacancy rates, but percent of properties held off market).

If you're studying the effect of a vacancy tax on housing construction though, the trouble is that over 50 years, the assumption that two cities would have produced the same amount of housing other than that one passed a vacancy tax becomes harder and harder to justify. Lots of things happen in cities -- job markets change, zoning laws change, natural disasters happen, etc.Since there's so much stuff that affects housing production, you usually need something really strong -- like zoning -- to be able to identify long run effects. And even with something as strong as zoning, which literally makes building certain things certain places illegal, questions like ""how much housing would san francisco build if you made it totally legal"" are actually hard to answer other than ""probably quite a lot."" Since a vacancy tax has way, way weaker impacts on construction compared to zoning, studying those marginal discouragements is even harder -- probably impossible."
Why do you guys pay down your mortgages instead of having life insurance pay the mortgages?,"Weighing in here as a life actuary.

Where do you find “your people?”,"&gt; the experiences we’ve had traveling the world and developing a sense of culture make it harder to relate to most people we come across.

Respectfully, have you considered that you might be part of the problem? This is a terrible attitude. Traveling is supposed to open your horizons and make it easier to relate to more different kind of people. If you come back from traveling and say ""sigh, I could never relate to these other folks that aren't as worldly as I"", you're taking the wrong lessons from it!

&gt; most people we’ve met here who have done well seem to be oddly competitive and materialistic about it, even extending their finances to have the nicest newest stuff and the biggest houses possible. That’s just not us.

"if 35-80% of US dollars were printed in 2020, why is inflation ‘only’ at 6.8%?","About your question  ""*surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation?*"", I'd like to crib from an earlier comment of mine to answer:

The idea that changes in money supply lead to lock step changes in prices, derives from the quantity equation of money:

  MV = PT 

If V, velocity, is stable, and T, total transactions, is unrelated to changes in M, then any increases in M will lead to increases in P. 

The last 15 years have shown (last 30 years in Japan) that it's a fallacy to think that the quantity theory of money always holds. Krugman terms this fallacy, the idea that an increase in the money supply will always somehow cause inflation even if there is no economic overheating, [“the doctrine of immaculate inflation”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/opinion/cryptocurrency-inflation.html).

There are two issues with the quantity theory of money described above:  i) The relationship only holds in the *long run*, as M and T are related in the short run, and ii) If nominal interest rates are near zero, then velocity becomes unanchored, and money becomes as good an asset to hold as bonds (money and bonds become interchangeable). The latter situation is termed a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap).

A better model for inflation in the short run (and in the longer run if there is liquidity trap), is that inflation changes according to the state of the macroeconomy. Inflation will tend to accelerate if the economy is overheating (aggregate demand exceeds long run productive capacity), and inflation will tend to decelerate if the economy is in a recession."

"About 20 years ago, UCLA economists published a study arguing that FDR's policies prolonged the Great Depression by seven years. How was this study received at the time? How is it viewed today?","To elaborate on highbrowalcoholics point, Cole and Ohanian's paper analyzed the impact of FDRs policies regarding labor market regulations and anti-trust policy. These were intended to be a major part of FDR's recovery plan. Briefly, these policies involved the following:

- Stronger labor unions, generally giving labor more power. FDR believed higher wages would improve the economy. 
- Promoting monopolies and collusion. The idea behind this is to resolve [Coordination failure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_failure_(economics\)#:~:text=In%20an%20economic%20system%20with,in%20a%20self%2Dfulfilling%20prophecy). If firms can increase their rents, they're less likely to shut down. 
- Related to the previous point, he enacted a plan allowing industry wide labor unions and industry wide firm cartels to enact legally binding regulations on themselves (today, we would probably call this ""sectoral bargaining""). I'm mentioning this separately because it was both the most radical part of FDRs recovery plan and it was also very short lived because it was ruled unconstitutional. Different policies in this area remained basically because FDR instructed the Justice Department to not sue firms for antitrust violations and congress later passed stronger labor market regulations anyway. 

It's not a very surprising or novel (even for the time) finding that this subset of the New Deal greatly prolonged the Great Depression. Real wages increased sharply and this lead to higher unemployment, consistent with standard macro theory. 

The main contribution of this paper appears to be them setting up and calibrating a DSGE model that accounts for FDR's cartelization policies. I can't tell you if the paper is good. I just don't have the training yet. I'll say that I find calibration exercises strange and really uncompelling, but from my understanding it's the most practical way to estimate DSGE parameters."
Buying Stocks: Where Does Money Go?,"1) You are correct, the company only receives the money when the original stock issuance occurs. Any subsequent buying and selling of the stock is on a secondary market and does not provide any funding to the company. 

2) The stockholders are the owners of the company. They would have no reason to invest in the first place and provide capital to the company if they were not compensated for it. When a company returns money to shareholders, it is primarily done through dividend payments or by repurchasing shares, which reduces the amount of stock in circulation and increases the value of the ones that remain. This way the stock remains valuable, which is important for a few reasons. Top of mind is that if the company wants to raise capital in the future, they can issue more shares at a higher price and receive more funding from investors. 

A helpful way to think about this relationship may be the fact that most business/economics classes have historically taught that the main job of a company is to “maximize shareholder value” since they are the owners of the company. This view is changing some, but it is still helpful to keep in mind when understanding how a company views its shareholders."
Is there a legitimate bull case for Gamestop (GME)?,"well if he came in at 80 dollars he is doing amazing. if he hasnt atleast taken out his initial investment to ride on house money, then sure he could learn from that. But chances are hes having a blast up well over 200%.

Why are you worried about him losing money when he is up so much? Did you ask him if he had taken any profits at all? did you ask him at all about it? im having a hard time seeing your intent here

stock is above 200 dollars right now. If it doesnt drop back below 80 your friend is laughing his ass off on the moon. Chances of it dropping back that low are pretty low if you look at the last year of the charts. so many people own shares above 200 and even 300 dollars there is way too much market pressure and eyes on gamestop to have it just poof back out of existence.

What is your favorite economics paper?,"I haven't read a wealth of papers, one that did impact me was Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky.

 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?seq=1)

&gt;This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling."

Guidance for beginners,"If I was starting in this space today, I would most likely pick a cryptocurrency - btc/ eth.

Assuming it’s not lightning fast, python can likely do most of it. As you go along keep improving your knowledge of programming via structured courses if you can - I would recommend data camp, but YouTube can work if budget is tight. (Though if budget is this tight, are you likely to have appropriate capita for algo trading - in this scenario you may wish to get a part time job to increase your available risk capital). 

Now you have a basic setup and know what data you have. You’ve also learned a lot about programming which will make it easier to debug. Now you want to research some strategies. Look to what worked in established markets - forex, try and make some leaps in logic about what may be applicable to a younger market. If you have no ideas, make a simple momentum strategy (eg if 2 hours in a row are bullish, is the third statistically likely to be bullish or bearish?). Again simply researching this is an education and probably will fail. Accept this.

Now you’ve got a strategy that seems promising and it’s backrest to perfection🧐. Run it live without trading (forward testing). 

Try also trading it manually with small money and watch the results? Also what is the liquidity of the market that could start moving it against you (more important if you go for rogue things to trade or small cap coins). 

If all seems good, it is worth whilst forward testing to run some Monte Carlo simulations on the back tests, verify you didn’t just get lucky with your start point. 

Expect most strategies and ideas to fail. Be critical of your own work like it’s someone you really dislike and you’ve been asked to review their assignment.

What you don’t want is to deploy a failing strategy. But also don’t go a year trying nothing. 

Ideas &gt; backrest &gt; thorough backtest &gt; forward test &gt; Monte Carlo &gt; paper trade &gt; live trade. 

Double check for overfitting. Double check you do not feed future data to a model.

Lastly, find some friends who are also keen and at a similar level. Much more fun than motivating yourself alone.

Good Luck out there. 🦢

My Employer Offered My Position at a 45% Decrease After Being Furloughed,General rules for unemployment are that you should be available and willing to work at any comparable or reasonable employment. Employer offering a 45% pay cut wouldn't be a comparable job (it's a much worse one) so you're free to decline it and continue receiving unemployment while you look for a comparable job.

"What would happen to the economy of the U.S. if no one bought Veblen Goods or engaged in Conspicuous Consumption, i.e. buying $400 shoes that cost $30 to make in a sweatshop?","&gt;People are attracted to status and things like Supreme T-shirts that cost $200 and I was wondering, what if people ONLY bought items that have utilitarian value that is equal to that item's price?

First of all, value is subjective, and people trade willingly. If you buy a $200 t-shirt, it follows that the value you derive from that t-shirt is as big or bigger than the value of the $200 you exchanged for it. There really is no such thing as anything resembling ""objective"" utilitarian value.

Second of all, consumption *is* the point. You live a frugal life, save all your money and invest it wisely. And then what? You can die sitting on a pile of cash, but what for? It's ultimately not useful if you don't spend it. And the economy as a whole doesn't really care what you spend it on. You could make a bigger point about consumption vs. investment for the economy as a whole, but on an individual level, saving $800 and spending $200 matters more in that regard than whether you spend those $200 on ""utilitarian"" shirts that are cheap or one fancy one."

From losing -$16k to getting it back. My journey on ASX_Bets. The lessons I learnt as a new investor,"Nice post.

While I agree with the sentiment 100%, and there are some genuine dogs in that first list, you (we) really caught memey specs on a big upswing that might not have been. You can chalk that up to savvy or TA or whatever and you might be right, and I don't want to shoot you down at all, but meme stocks are still meme stocks.

IHL could probably do a $400M version of XST, and if you bought LKE in march at 40c it could justifiably have made it into the other list if the list had been written in June. Conversely, IBG could sit happily on the second list and nobody would ask twice.

So nice work, really. But I'd be careful with drawing too many conclusions from it (except the one about staying out of binary O&amp;G plays) because you could loosely have said ""I lost 16k by timing the top of a speculatives bull market, then made 16k by still being invested for the next one"" and it would have been a perfectly good explanation.

For what it's worth, I don't currently hold any of these, but I definitely did also go backwards by a large amount from march to june and gain it back and more since. 

TL;Dr: agree with ""don't be a sucker"", but would be more cautious about any other lessons"

Why do some Nationalized airlines do outstanding (Emirates) While others offer a subpar experience to private and bleed money (Air India)? And other confusions regarding airlines.,"Nationalized industries generally underperform private ones. But, there are always exceptions. Sometimes nationalized industries come into the hands of talented people and do well. People remark on it because it's fairly unusual.

There are also political differences. The UAE is a fairly small place, it doesn't need many internal flights. On the other hand India is a big place and it certainly does. As a result, the policies of Air India have domestic political importance. If it stops serving a particular place then politicians are likely complain and pressure the management of Air India. That is much less likely to happen for Emirates which is mostly serving foreigners not UAE residents. This is also why large countries tend to keep their unsuccessful nationalized airlines whereas small countries don't.

In some countries the private airlines are subsidized which is one reason they tend to be fairly poor. Also in some countries the private airlines are protected by regulation from international competition."

Why should I waste my time?,"Two real traders I found on reddit sharing their stuff. Both have said they got it over years of work (like most other traders):

The stats are around 90% to 95%? Usually? It’s all different. I’m sick of seeing the “statistics” on that because

1) what even is a trader from these studies? Any old asshole who opens an account and doesn’t even learn the groundwork/expectations for success? Or someone who puts engineering degree level dedication in learning how to be profitable? Take that Brazilian study a few months ago- it tracked them for 300 days... 300 days? Most things that can earn you a decent living take way longer than 300 days to become trained in.

2) Ok, let’s go with it. These stats say 90% or more fail. Well I got news for you:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#5d1e3a4a6679

Or how about this:

https://www.tomferry.com/blog/87-of-all-agents-fail-in-real-estate/

Also, 

You’ll have to verify this because I don’t have a link to the stats, but if you have a YouTube Chanel with 50k subs that already puts you on the top 3% or so. I can tell you as someone who had a YouTube channel that size, all I did was treat it with job level dedication for a few years and paid attention to what people wanted. 

I think these kinds of jobs listed people treat them like “play” (YouTube, trading, business, real estate agent). Low barrier to entry. People aren’t serious about it. As the reality is many already have a 9-5, a “real” job. And they want some sort of life. So guess what gets low effort put into it? Just my thoughts.

Myself? I have been studying/looking at trading for a year. Began seriously day trading about 6 months ago. I’m a break even trader still. First 3 months way back on my reddit account.

These are my thoughts. You can decide what you want to believe.

Edit: as far as fund managers, one thing I could add is you don’t compete with them. They are the market in a sense because they move it. We are small fish who want to ride those waves. Strategies do not scale to a gazillion dollars for that reason. That’s why I hate when people say, well if you were so good, why aren’t you buffet rich? Well, you can get well off with shorter term trading. Not that well off. Liquidity is the main reason. But people like to spat about things they don’t understand."

I give credit to the new investors who got into Crypto earlier in the year and are holding through this,"Thanks dude, I bought in for the first time few days before the may crash. I have never seen my portfolio in the plus. In fact it's down like 40% I think right now, kinda disheartening, but oh well let's wait it out"
"I will tell you exactly what is going on here, this is critical information to understand if you are going to make money in this space. How prices work, and what moves them - and it's not money invested/withdrawn.","I just want to say something about my target audience here...

It's not to turn the opinion of weak hands and correct the market. Weak hands are going to sell regardless of what I say, and the last thing I want is to convince someone to do something they don't want to do. I'm not trying to ""save crypto"", that's not up to me, and crypto isn't going anywhere regardless. We've been through pullbacks 10+ times now already and every time we rebound to higher and higher ceilings and floors. The people leaving are buying speculation, and the people staying believe that this is the next ""internet"". Sure some pets.com are going to die horrible deaths, and they NEED TO, but the googles, amazons and microsofts in the future are in here. Blockchain itself is going to be incorporated into every aspect of life, economics, business in the future. Look at things like how the Canadian National Research Council is going to be putting research on the blockchain for immutable storage of human science and technology. Using blockchain as our generation's ""Library of Alexandria""...

The key to blockchain going forward isn't going to be to find the next ""blockchain paypall"", REQ, the next ""Blockchain reddit"" (STEEM), it's going to be finding blockchain innovations that haven't even been imagined yet, because the world infrastructure is just now being created to allow for these new technologies. I'm talking about stuff like how Lasers allowed 3d printing, and quantum dot technology. How the space race created advanced materials science, how the nuclear arms race created fission reactors.

No, I'm not trying to ""Save crypto"" because crypto doesn't need saving. The technology wins out in the end.

What I'm trying to do here is to give newer investors an opportunity to stop and critically think about what they are holding and if they truly want to let go. Are you leaving because you don't believe in this anymore, or are you leaving because you are being manipulated and persuaded? Or are you trying to cut losses with the hopes of buying back in and getting a stronger position?

To be quite frank, I don't mind the dip, crash, bubble pop, whatever. I got in fairly late. I was one of the ""this magic internet points thing is a joke right?""... until I started giving it a little respect and doing my own research.

You see, I missed out on the ground floor. I hate to say this, but I actually like what is going on here. I'm part of this ""old money"" wanting in. 

I probably understand this perspective (big money wanting in), because I have the same vantage point. Infact, I love what's going on here, from a purely selfish personal standpoint.

I probably should have got in 1-2 years before I did. I ""missed the boat"". I finally decided that I'm going to keep saying that, every few months, until I actually have missed the boat. I decided that even at 500B market cap, that I probably was still an early adopter, and this thing has legs.

So I started putting some money in. Overall this past week is the first week I've been down as a whole. It feels bad for sure. But when I stop and think.... this is letting me go back in time and extends my time and buying power for the next X years. 

So I kind of secretly hope this dip lasts a bit. I'm not the type of person to just dump 100k on something, even though I probably could. I'd rather just set a weekly budget, consider that money gone, and be okay with that. I can't consider 100k gone and be okay with it, but I could be okay with losing that much over a few years.

So while I've lost about $10k from my all time high, I haven't lost any money until I've sold, and even if I sold I'm still just slightly below break-even, through a 60% market correction that I lived in the entire time. 

No, with this pullback, I've gained the opportunity to spend a few more weeks buying in lower and expanding the floor a bit. Since I'm not selling for a decade or so, I honestly couldn't give a shit about the price today... infact, if I wanted to be completely honest, the price today being low is a net benefit, provided the price 10 years from now in both scenarios is the same. 

Infact, the optional scenario for me personally would be for this thing to fall to near zero, buy in on the way down the whole way, then in 10 years this thing wakes up again.

Since I legitimately beleive in this thing, and because I can maneuver here and there as we go (say swapping this tech for that tech, etc, some BTC for some more ETH, etc), I can plan out and invest in what looks best 10 years from now, because

10 years from now is the only time that I will EVER want the price to be high. It feels bad to see market falling, but I'd rather buy $750 ETH than $2000 ETH, since I'm holding it anyways.

You know?

So my goal here isn't to stop Joe Blow from panic selling. He will do that anyways. I just wanted to offer people a different perspective. You don't get the chance to get in on the ground floor on something like this that often. 

I thought I missed my chance, but this pullback has quite the silver lining.

If I didn't think this thing was going to recover, I wouldn't be here. And if it doesn't recover ever, then I've only lost money that I'm okay losing. 

I'm not going to try to exit into fiat and then time a floor, because that's a good way to miss out. I've already held through a 50% **paper** loss, the worst feeling in the world could be to sell now, **seal-in** that 50% loss (make it a reality by selling) then watch the train leave the station while I'm in line trying to buy a ticket.

All these things combined ... I feel completely unafraid, and I am not only holding, but am going to continue buying in, all the way down. But I'm going to do it in a responsible way, that I can comfortably afford. I will consider any money lost to be for ""entertainment"", although expensive entertainment. But if this thing turns around, maybe I retire and I bought 20+ years of life. 

What kind of price can you put on that?"
Why doesn’t the USD weaken?,"The strenght of the dollar is decided in comparison to other currencies and especially influenced by the trust investors have longitudinally in the US economy - so not just the now.


Everything you say is more or less correct - but how does it relate to other markets? Do you have any reason to believe alternative options will be safer in the long-run? And before you consider those alternatives - do take into account other important factors for investors, whom for example are unlikely to take well to governments which they expect to be highly interventionist in their currency.


Thus, if all are doing poor, investors can flock to those who are perceived to do least poor or are least expected to have long-term damage from it. You may be better off comparing it to other assets investors flock to as safe-heavens, such as gold. Though I'm not by any means an expert on those investments, gold has been on the rise for a while now."
“UHNW” but still afraid to FatFIRE. Advice requested…,"I mean this in the best way possible but It sounds more, rather than career advice,  you need a wake up call to:

a) how short life is/can be/time with family can be

b) how little you think $30m dollars is

As a hypothetical, if your lifestyle choices revolve around trying to keep up with the Forbes100 then $30m is gone in a couple of months. If your lifestyle choices are based around having enough money to comfortably live a wonderful, full, life with your family then $30m is plenty AND change.

It seems in the absence of a grander meaning or sense of purpose you are pinning incremental (imo, diminishing returns) gains in NW as a measure of success even though you have almost objectively achieved it in capitalistic terms. Seek a good therapist that has UHNW clients and it could be the best investment you make! 

Good luck! :)"
How taxes work for day traders in the USA,"You only get taxed on you net profits, basically 20% of your gains.

So if you start with $1000 and through all your trades end up at $2000, then your net gains are $2000-$1000=$1000

That $1000 x .2 = $200. That's what you can expect to owe

Add together all gains and losses, subtract what you initially paid for them, and that's your tax burden. Here's what it looks like with multiple trades


Bought $1000, sold for  $2000 =Gains are $1000

Bought $1000, sold for  $500 =Gains are -$500

Bought $1000, sold for  $3000 =Gains are $2000

Bought $1000, sold for  $100 =Gains are -$900

Total net gains are $1000 - $500 +$2000 - $900 = $1600

$1600 x 20% = $320 this is your tax burden"
What economic system is modern China currently on?,"&gt;  ... ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"", a form of market socialism.

...

&gt; ... China is capitalist...

The problem with these terms is that they're too vague. Over the years many people have used them to mean many things. As a result, the meaning has gradually worn off them. Now it's very hard to tell what they mean. You will rarely find them in Economics papers for that reason.

It's much better to talk more about things more specifically. I think we can all agree that China is a country with state-run businesses and private businesses."
What kind of books do I need to read to make sense of Economist articles?,"The best way to do it would be to read an economics textbook. I recommend Mankiw.

Time Bomb,"Tldr: Buy. DRS. Vote. In that order. Not financial advice

I think RC and crew waited until apes registered enough to dwarf vote fuckery. There's no way SHFs+BCG would have allowed this proposal to move forward before RC's takeover

With the trimmed average DRS passing over 30% of the float very soon if not today, add in RC's what, 11%? Plus the other executives... And DFV... are we over 50%?

I recall overvotes being normalized, so the shares held at DTCC make up the float % no matter how many synthetics they create. Along with those synthetics, SHFs have been using BCG and other consultants to ensure they know how each insider vote will go, so it takes an incredible movement by retail to have any impact in corporate decisions.

DRSing will ensure your vote counts as a full vote. The fate of the company is firmly in your hands... If you're a registered shareholder.

Is Money Everything?,"Take note that when you give money to friends, you either:

* Lend it to them officially, i.e. go to a notary, sign some papers, arrange a schedule for when they’re going to return it, etc.; or
* Just give it to them when they’re in need, not caring where they spend it and never expecting to get it back.

Which way to go for depends on you (and on the specific amount somewhat as well). The popular in-between way to lend money to friends when you give cash to them without any papers and then kinda expect them not to buy iPhones and jewelry up until they return the unofficial loan is a classic way to break friendships."

Apart from Reddit which sites do you use to do your DD?,"You can sort of cheat by looking at big investment firms funds to get hints. So if you look at funds for example at Legal &amp; General they’ll show fund fact sheets which breakdown what % of the fund is held in which sector/geographical area and even companies. Then you can look up the company to research why they might be held, or if a fund invests the majority in X sector, start looking up developments in that area and this will show news articles of which companies are doing good things

I signed up to a newsletter from Hargreaves Lansdown too which shows weekly breakdowns of companies that will be listing their yearly/half yearly performance. Sometimes they review the company too and then I look into them a bit further from there"
Synopsis for 04-23-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD,"/u/Rensole M8 I think you got that info about the share recall wrong. 

You have to be not only the owner, but also the holder of record by the record date. If you lend your shares out, you also give up on your voting rights and are not the holder of record. 

Depending on who has the shares during the record date, that person gets the voting right. So if the loaned-out shares are not returned to the original owner by the record date, they do not get voting rights. Literally copied from investopia

What’s the best route to learn a solid foundation on economics?,"The best way would be to go to university/college and get a degree in economics if that's where your interest is. However, that isn't realistic for most people. Your next best option imo would be to get a copy of a first year introduction to micro and macro textbook, and go from there. Used and older copies can be found online, and generally the newest copies don't have any new information, they're just laid out a little bit differently.

Another option would be ""Economics for Dummies"". The For Dummies books in general are really well done, and are written well for people who have little to no knowledge on the topic. They're cheap as well, which is a big plus.

Either of these will give you a decent base level of knowledge, and if you still want to take it farther, you can also look for higher level textbooks as well. I've found that there isn't a whole lot of economics learning outside of a school setting, like you would find with learning programming for example. So for this reason, upper year textbooks would be your best bet."

Online game defying laws of economics??,"There's some interesting studies on the economies of online video games. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1630302

Online video game communities often mimic real-world markets. Players will trade, currencies can develop (you reference spiked collars; other games have seen similar things where an in-game item becomes a currency). Some players group together, actors join and leave the economy, different players achieve different efficiencies. Often players specialize (either by design, or by choice)...

But there are some key differences. The game economies are inherently unstable... Designers can intentionally change things (the rarity of an item is usually just an number in a database). They can create new things (with or without regards to what the community desires), they can remove existing things. External actors like hackers / cheaters can also disrupt the economy.

Eve Online was famous for hiring an economist to help manage the virtual economy, creating interesting conditions which (due to all the data being tracked) led to published papers! See: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412014565507

Did Trump actually help or hurt the economy?,"You've asked this exact question [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/ouco18/did_donald_trump_actually_help_or_hurt_the_economy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and I think the answer you got is a good one. 

It is a very broad question (what exactly do you mean by helping the economy? The economy is just not one big thing, it has many moving parts) and people will disagree.

The Trump tax cuts, for example, may boost business investment in the long run but were unfunded and will therefore make the debt far worse. Is that good or bad for the economy? Its a little bit of both and depends which part of the economy you care more about.

Trump was a walking disaster. His mismanagement of covid did a great deal of damage to the economy. His tariffs generally hurt American businesses and  consumers. He made your Budget unmanageable. So if you wanted an answer, I think Trump was bad for the economy. But people will disagree. Thats what happens in politics."
How do billionaires lending money instead of paying taxes on selling stocks repay their loans without having the money needed to pay back to be taxed?,"Two ways. 

1) just let the interest compound until death. At that point you avoid the income tax with a step up in basis and you sell the asset to cover the loan. 

I'd wager this is the most popular, especially for really large net worths. 

2) strategically time sales and pair with deductions to minimize tax, and then pay down the loan. This involves realizing cap losses to offset gains, using depreciation and charitable deductions to min tax impact of sales. 

Anyone can use this strategy, it's just more valuable when your tax rate is high. 


Interested to hear if any tax accountants have some additional insight here."

what is the difference between futures and options?,"Simplifying a lot, the main difference is that in a futures contract both the long and the short have obligations, while in an options contract the short has an obligation and the long has a right (ie, a ""choice"", a ""possibility"").

For example, with a corn futures contract, if I'm the buyer (long) and you're the seller (short), when the contract expires I have the obligation to pay cash and you have the obligation to send me corn. With an option, specifically a call option, if I'm the buyer (or holder, or long) and you're the seller (or writer, or short) at expiration I can choose if I'm gonna send you money and force you to send me corn, or if I just want to ignore the contract and not do anything about it (and you're released from your obligation). Similarly, if I buy a put from you, I have the right to decide whether I want to send corn your way and force you to pay me the amount specified in the option contract, or I may simply decide to let the put expire and release you from your obligation to take delivery."

Would a law requiring employers to provide feedback to rejected job candidates reduce labor market friction?,"My gut reaction is this would only create more frictions including (but not limited to) the following reasons:

1) it is, by construct, (at least) one additional regulation that requires certain degrees of compliance, enforcement, and (possibly) litigation - (corollary: if you tell me I have to check a box each time I dont hire someone, I'm going to check the box in such a way that is the least pain in my ass/most CMA and less in support of the person I didn't hire)

2)  it would move hiring managers from their previous focus of new hires to this now stipulated focus of people who didn't get the job

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I think it's a particularly interesting thought experiment so let's play it out

First, what are the frictions in the labor market right now? Are they primarily informational (eg potential workers not knowing how to ID a good match)? (other sources of friction could be things like spatial or skill mismatch, reservation wages, etc)

Next, conditional on informational asymmetries, what is the correlation in information between job seekers? (consider I  apply for a job at company A, and they tell me im not hired because of reason X--&gt;does that imply reason X also makes me a bad fit at company B?

Third, if we know the answers to the above questions, how do we draft ideal legislation?  you mention a multiple choice of 10 possible reasons--what might those reasons look like? are they the same for each company? are candidates required to disclose the reasons they havent been hired previously?

Again, great question and I think worthy of more thought, these are just the ways I played around with it--happy to chat further in comments"

How much would a single payer system like Bernie's cost to implement? Would we be able to save money from a single payer system?,"This is obviously a politically charged question. You'll get various opinions.

As a starting point, the IGM panel of economics were polled on this at the start of 2020. See part 1 [here](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/mandatory-medicare-i/) and part 2 [here](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/mandatory-medicare-ii/).

Note that these don't tackle the question of how much it will cost; rather they limit to directional questions (would there be more or less access, more or less medical debt, etc...).

The CBO's cost estimate you link notes:

&gt;Government spending on health care would increase substantially under a single-payer system. In 2017, just under half of the $3.5 trillion in national health care spending came from private sources. Shifting a large amount of expenditures from private to public sources would significantly increase government spending and require additional government resources, but it would also reduce or eliminate the costs incurred by private sources, such as employers’ and employees’ contributions for employment-based insurance. 

That same report does a bit of a breakdown for how it could be financed, but stops short of specific numbers, as to do so they'd need a framework for how it will be implemented.  They do have short notes on how it's done in other nations:

&gt;Countries with single-payer systems generally collect funds through the tax system. Canada and England finance their single-payer systems mostly through general revenues. Other means of financing include dedicated flat-rate income taxes (as in Denmark) or payroll-based premiums (as in Taiwan).

So, they a benchmark ($3.5T / year) based on current total spending (government and private). But, this benchmark is assuming there are no cost differences or significant changes in healthcare consumption. If one assumes there are large cost savings; the price goes down. If one assumes there are few cost savings but a large increase in demand for healthcare services: the price goes up. 

Regardless, this would be an increase is spending by the government. But to know if it'd save money in aggregate you need to compare to the private costs which would be eliminated.  The CBO report does not address this question. Again, they'd need a framework for how such a system would be setup... Congress would have to request such an analysis. In general the CBO tries to estimate based on requests from Congress; they don't pro-actively run numbers as that's not their role.

Here's a meta-study that reviews 22 different analysis of single-payer proposals: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961869/

The problem with comparing this however is that each of these analysis looks at different proposals. How you structure single-payer effects the projected cost. Some of those underlying analysis reviewed were quite different in regards to what they considered to be in scope (long-term care, elective procedures, assumptions on utilization, etc...). Their conclusion (form the abstract):

&gt;In this systematic review, we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single-payer approach in the US. Actual costs will depend on plan features and implementation.

But again, framing that question matters.  It costs less **in aggregate**; not less **for the government**. There is a massive cost transfer from individuals to the government; but most studies agree this would result in less total spending on healthcare."

"If perpetually borrowing money is irresponsible and unsustainable at the level of the individual, why is it commonplace and orthodox policy at the macroeconomic level?","One simple (but not entirely accurate) way to understand it is that countries are essentially immortal, or at least very long lived. 

For an individual, it is not irresponsible to borrow when you are starting out, to buy a house or a car. Similarly, countries borrowing to invest in infrastructure is entirely responsible. In the hypothetical far future, when the country has reached a quasi-utopic steady state, these borrowings can be paid back easily. In fact, they would likely have become largely irrelevant."

"Premarket Thread for General Trading and Plans for Wednesday, April 07, 2021","I think a lot of people on this sub fall for the social proof tendency, i.e. if everyone is talking about a particular stock, there's no way they can all be wrong, therefore I should follow the crowd.

I'll not claim to have the best advice or anything but I bought a house young, not making a lot of money, and I live in the Midwest, so maybe the familiarity will help.

Longer-term solutions: Primarily, get a roommate. That will help a ton. Shop for better car insurance, internet and cell phone rates. It won't seem like a lot saved, but every bit helps.

Temporary solutions if you feel damage control is necessary: Knock back your 401k contribution to 4%. Retirement is only useful if you make it there, and being this stressed at 24 won't cut it. Talk to your therapist about every other week sessions, and if they feel that would be ok for your mental health, and if you can supplement with mental health apps or books they recommend. Lastly, student loans might have a deferment option for hardships if times are tough.

Things I've Learned After 15 Years Of Trading,"I already pushed the save button before you mentioned it.  
Great tips.

Some questions if it's appropriate:

""Trading triple ETFS will deplete the account over the long term.""  
Do you mean day trading? And why? I have a long term momentum strategy which holds triple ETF's for an average of 1-3 months and it goes quite well for me. Pls let me know if I'm missing something.

""Good fundamental analysis and proper technical trading is a killer combination. Think CANSLIM / IBD (investors Business Daily)""  
Does that mean you'll never short (day trade) a stock that has good fundamentals, even not, if for whatever reason there is a correction taking place? And also the other way around (long on low fundamental stocks). PS Someone else mentioned Seasonax to add to this equation.

""Candle stick patterns don't mean anything WITHOUT follow thru. A Hammer or a DOJI means nothing unless it gets follow thru the next day.""  
So, you're saying that you always have to wait for confirmation?

""Very hard to short a market when the financial stocks(XLF) are strong.""  
Financial stocks are strong right now ... So, you're bullish on the general market outlook? Can you explain this statement a bit more pls?

""Never short a market in momentum mode.""  
You mean in positive momentum, I guess? Sell low and sell lower would you recommend?

When is it appropriate to start helping parents?,"The reality is your parents are going to retire on social security.

I think that’s the safest way for your gift to actually make a lasting difference, and you get to retain equity so it’s not a complete loss.

Edit:
Lots of people getting hung up on my LLC suggestion. There are pros and cons. I keep all my RE holdings in LLCs.

A CPA who is creative enough might be able to depreciate and deduct some stuff - especially if OP goes the multi-family unit route and makes his parents ""property managers."" LLCs are cheap and easy to set up. Negatives involve getting loans, but most people just take a personal loan on RE and then file a quitclaim to transfer the deed to the LLC without telling the bank. I am not going to debate whether or not this is a good idea, but it is extremely common in the RE industry. Regardless, everyone needs to do their own due diligence and figure out what works best for them.

Is this true or bull? The nature of money.,"To be clear, in most cases money does technically represent liabilities (""debts"") of a bank. In my view, it is merely cute, a play with language, to say that the great depression was a case of too little debt. It was a case of allowing the banks to fail *en masse*, making their ""debts"" (consumer and business deposits) worthless to the holders of those debts, essentially creating a downward spiral and destroying wealth.

If you follow Kindleberger in his analysis of the great depression, we experienced it because we lacked a global lender of last resort who could create, at the critical time, more liabilities (""debts"") to assist payment through the crisis within the international banking system. This, however, is another discussion.

Anyways, yes, this is exactly how it works. This was so widely understood pre-1950s that economists, such as Schumpeter, referred to it as something which does not need to be explained when they referred to it as they discussed business cycles.

The money created by banks is referred to by a number of technical names, depending on the economists, such as ""bank money,"" ""inside money"" (versus outside money), ""fiduciary media."" The creation of money by the private banking system has a long history of being blamed for the business cycle - e.g., the classic Austrian analysis or Schumpeter. It is latent in Keynes as well, although (for complicated reasons I'd rather not go into) I think he wanted to avoid getting into the banking credit cycle when discussing effective demand, investment, interest and unemployment."
Are Wall Street and Hedge funds serving their social function?,"Most asset management firms (which provide long term funds and generally safer investments that also charge relatively low fees) engineer their products toward the middle class. It's not profitable for financial firms to only serve filthy rich clients, the highest volume of money is in the median income range. That being said, yes, they do serve their social function. Anyone can put money into a fund ran by an AM firm and make a nice return: The AM charges a relatively low fee to the client. Both walk away with money.

&gt; not making anything, but keeping themselves rich 

A hedge fund, or really any financial firm have an ultra dependency on their clients. If a hedge fund performs badly and loses client money, no clients would return, and the money would be alternatively placed in a differing firm where a better return will be generated.

The only purpose of a hedge fund is to generate wealth. If they can't generate wealth for their clients, the company would go bust, because they're  not serving their purpose.

I lost $6 million in 12 months. ~60% of my net worth Advice?,"Some of the smartest people in the world have lost more/blown up more (for example, Long Term Capital Management in the 90s), so this doesn't make you ""an idiot"".

Put another way, that $2M -&gt; 10M was more luck than anything else. So don't look at it as if you've lost $6M, look at it as if you've gained $2.5M by going from $2M to $4.5M. That's a phenomenal return by any measure for just 2 years!

Now, I would recommend to diversify out of your current asset mix. And I think it's time for you to read a bit more into investing. I won't touch on that here because there is a wealth of material in this sub.

Second, most traders don't have the correct info on what it means to be successful trader. And often they spend years to even start scratching the surface. For example, Many noobs get into this habit of finding high win percentage systems because apparently winning 90% trades sounds cool. They don't understand the concept of positive expectancy. And it takes years just to find that even winning less than 50% is fine if you have a positive expectancy system. In the meantime, hours are spent hopping around trying to find the high win systems.

Still to your point on number of hours put in can make you a pro in other fields. That is absolutely true. The problem is most people approach markets as a way to make easy money. They don't approach it as a way to spend money and time to learn what it takes to be a pro trader. So, for most people they are better off spending time learning other skill than spending time learning to trade."
How dangerous is Market Crash?,"TL;DR;

Don't invest the money without which you can't survive for next 1-2 years. And keep some emergency fund, and some extra money to invest on crash, and you will be fine. To be even safer for initial few years, stick to index mutual funds or Index ETFs.


You don't have to be afraid of a market crash as far as:

1. You are not doing any kind of day trading, or options futures trading.

2. You don't take loans and invest it in market. It involves any other leverage as well (like, taking a loan against some of your shares, and investing the loan money in other shares)

3. You are not investing any emergency money in the market. Emergency in sense, that you don't need that money within few months. This is important, because you need to be comfortable in leaving that money invested, even if there's a 40% market crash. As far as you aren't selling in panic, you don't really ""realise"" those losses.

4. You are diversifying your money among multiple good stocks, and not investing in 1-2 companies only. You shouldn't be investing in any kind of penny stocks as well, at least for initial few years. Because in case of a market crash, any penny stock tend to get crushed and such companies may also go bankrupt(being a penny also indicates that there must be some issues with the company, in most cases)

5. Best case scenario, if you have your money in index funds, you can look at even 30-40% losses, and sing merry songs. Index always comes up, within few months. (Worst to worst case, 1-2 years)

6. You have some emergency money (ideally 4-6 months worth of expenses) outside the stock market, so that you don't have to sell your stocks at loss, in case of any medical emergency, or job loss/salary cut, etc. Remember that market crashes for a reason, even if it's already overvalued. That reason could be a huge crash in US or Indian loan market. Or some new corona wave, or some war breaking out in some country, or even involving India. So there could be other hardships in your life/career/family, for which you might need some money in your hand. (Bank account, liquid funds, arbitrage funds, bank FDs, etc). Not all the money should be invested to aim for high returns. Some money should be there to make sure that you can ride through bad times, without selling your long term investments. This money save you abd your investments.

Apart from that, if you are expecting a crash for whatever reason, keep some money with you, to be invested when market crashes. How much it should be, is difficult to suggest as I have no idea about how much you earn, invest and need in next few years. But keep some money apart from your important needs. Even if you don't have a back-up money to invest, the worst that would happen is that you won't have money to invest at once, if market crashes. But that's okay, as far as you don't panic and sell what you have invested.

I personally was seeing losses running into a few lacs when market crashed in 2020, which converted into profits when market recovered. I didn't sell at loss. However, I did panic and did profit booking when NIFTY reached around 12500-13000 again.

The only people who get hurt by a crash are those who over-invest and need money desperately during a crash. In that case, even though the market might recover later, they are forced to sell at loss, to get some money.

And most of the ""crash brought us to street"" noise is from the traders who invest for short term profits, with high leverage, and in instruments that have expiry on a particular date. Because they don't have the liberty of sitting idle and keeping their money invested till market recovers again.

And sadly people jumping from roofs are the unfortunate ones who invest their children's education money, father's treatment money, or invest by taking huge loans."

When does real estate become worthless in Miami?,"There are essentially two answers here: the theoretical answer (that assumes rationality), and an answer that is more grounded in behavioral economics/finance. I'll start with the theoretical answer.

To find the price of a house that is going underwater, you first have to know what peoples ""discount rate"" is.

Theoretically, the price of a house is the value that the property brings for its entire lifetime. 

However, future value is ""discounted"" compared to value today. This is pretty intuitive: 10 dollars today is worth more to a person than 10 dollars in 10 years (even if you adjust for inflation).

For example, imagine that the ""value"" of a house is equivalent to 10000 dollars per year (including repairs). A buyer has a discount rate of 3%, and the house is expected to exist forever, as long as it is maintained. Then, using the perpetuity formula, the price would be 10000/0.03 = 333,333 dollars.

Now, let's say that the house is underwater in 40 years. Then we use the annuity formula, P = PMT x ((1 – (1 / (1 + r) ^ -n)) / r), were P is the price of the house, PMT is the value per year, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years. Plugging in 10000, 0.03, and 40 gives a price of 231,147. At 30 years, the price is 194,004. At 20 years, it is 148,774, and it keeps going down, until it reaches 10000 the last year before going underwater.

This is, of course, highly theoretical, and not really how it works in the real world (also, it's reasonable to assume that the value of living in a soon to be dead city is a lot smaller, due to people wanting stability, so PMT likely changes as we get closer to the end). The annuity formula might provide a reasonable prediction for summerhouses, since everyone already knows will be going underwater at some point, but it is likely not accurate for a global city in which the risk of the house going underwater is not yet something that people have really internalized.

So now to the behavioral economics perspective, which is a lot more grounded in assumptions. In the real world, people see buying a house as an investment, in which the purchasing price is going to go up in the long term. Therefore houseprice are often inflated above their ""natural"" price due to speculation.

As soon as the general population realizes that this is really happening (assuming that it will, I am not a scientist, I don't know how ""certain"" this is), the entire ""speculation-premium"" to the price would disappear rather quickly. Also, as this happens, people would panic and try to sell their house as fast as possible, pushing prices down further. We would probably see much faster price drops than the steady, present value formula would indicate, as no one wants to live in a soon-to-be dead city.

So why haven't this happened yet? Most likely because the general population doesn't consider Miami to be a doomed city yet. 40 years is a long time, and people probably expect something ""to be done"". Once the inevitable doom of Miami really becomes part of the zeitgeist (again, I don't know if it is inevitable, I just assume so for the sake of argument), I would expect massive price drops in a relatively short time, as supply far exceeds demand, and as the city is slowly abandoned over time."
I took to value investing because it describes how I live life,"This subreddit is basically the opposite of wallstreetbets and i love it.

"Is ""Why Nations Fail"" considered good economics?","Daron Acemoglu was the driving influence behind the book and its about as on the fence as he is. Being a MIT professor he can't exactly be a radical but his points tend to stay in the centre of the political and economic spectrums without offering anything of substance.

For starters, it's important to realize that it is not a history book. Acemoglu and Robinson are both economists that are also well known in political science. They are interested in developing a general theory for why some nations are rich while others are poor. They are not trying to offer a holistic explanation for why any particular nation is rich or poor. If their theory is supported by historical evidence from multiple cases, then their theory likely has some truth to it, but it is not THE final explanation for why any single country or region is rich or poor.

Regarding their actual theory, I think it makes sense as far as it goes. Different political and economic institutions create different incentives for producers. Inclusive institutions lead to wide spread economic growth, and exclusive institutions allow elites to concentrate wealth at the expense of the rest of society. Geography and cultural hypotheses have limited explanatory power because countries like North and South Korea, or East and West German, have/had very similar geography and culture, but different economic trajectories.

Where I think their argument is weakest is that they don't really develop a theory for how institutions come to be or change over time. The roots of today's institutions are always located at some place in the past, which casts people today as having very little agency or control over conditions within society. Mexico is poor because when the Spanish showed up they were able to place themselves at the top of the Aztec's political system and take their gold. So Mexico developed exploitative institutions. The U.S. is rich because settlers did not find gold, and the Native Americans there weren't united under any central authority, so Europeans had to develop institutions that gave settlers economic incentives to invest and work hard. These explanations place the root cause of Mexico's poverty and U.S. prosperity hundreds of years into the past, as if nothing that happened between now and then mattered.

So that's my take on the book. The quality of a country's institutions surely help explain why some countries are richer than others, but without a theory for how institutions change overtime, the strength of their argument is limited to nonexistent."
"Is ""Why Nations Fail"" considered good economics?","I haven’t personally read it, but the authors Acemoglu and Robinson are both respected economists as far as I know. In my experience most “bad economics” books are by non-economists acting as if they understand economics."
Why are we letting younger generations to be priced out of the market?,"The younger generations have been priced out for a while now in many Asian countries i.e see Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai. Basically they just have to live with their parents or rent and wait for their parents to die. Even then it gets messy because you usually have 2-4 siblings you have to share the wealth with. It’s safe to assume that the same will happen in the West eventually."

"Are high taxation policies in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden (or just Sweden) causing rich people to leave Scandinavia, if they are leaving?","First of all, not all taxes are high in Sweden. We abolished our wealth tax (värnskatten) on January 1 of this year. Our corporate tax is 21.4%, and it will be lowered to 20.6% next year. As a comparison, the US corporate tax right now is 21%. During the Obama administration, the corporate tax was 35%. However, Sweden does have a high VAT (25%), capital gains tax (30%) and income tax.

The documentary you watched is by Johan Norberg, a Swedish neoliberal pundit. His argument is not that Sweden's taxes are very high right now. Rather, his argument is that tax increases and the [employee funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_funds) in the 80's led to protests by people and corporations, and culminated in the 90's banking crisis.

He cites the well-known example of Ingmar Bergman (film director who supposedly left Sweden because he was hounded by the IRS), and Astrid Lindgren (children's book author who had to pay 102% in taxes in 1976). I don't know how accurate this is. Norberg is obviously biased (he works for Cato), but I get the impression that he genuinely believes what he is saying.

Ultimately, I don't know if there is an exodus of rich people from Sweden. I haven't read any empirical research on it. The Swedish press has paid more attention to tech companies leaving. For example Skype, Spotify and SoundCloud were founded in Sweden, but are now headquartered elsewhere. This could be due to may factors: taxes, housing situation, business climate, etc."

Weekend GME Thread + Homework for all: Let's stop using brokerages that halted trading,"**ALLY INVEST - 4 DAY OUTAGE FOR MANY CUSTOMERS**

Hey everyone I just want to try and get some visibility here with what’s going on with Ally invest.

Ally bank has been used and recommended a lot over the years here on Reddit. Mainly for their savings accounts. A lot of people use their invest option for convenience and low fees.

Currently their investing/brokerage service is still down for many people and their customer service is being completely unresponsive.

My personal experience:

Thursday my cash balance of $16000 was wiped. Placed to $0. My Holdings were still present but any ability to purchase was removed by simply placing my cash balance to $0. 

It is now Saturday and 48hrs, 6 hours on phone hold, 4 chats, and 4 emails, and 1 SEC complaint, my account balance is still $0


They removed my ability to buy any stock, at all. I can only sell.

Thoughts on my plans?,Good diversification but would rather trim down heaps due to the fact that you are paying multiple fees for each ETF. You can do the maths per-annum in total and see how much you're paying in a year excluding div and taxes. I like SCHD &amp; JEPI &amp; VTI / VOO. Should be enough to keep you going or retire.
I'm saving and investing more money with no goals. Any suggestions to manage it shrewdly?,"I don't follow a goal based planning approach either.
I simply save for retirement and if a shorter goal comes up, I switch to that when the dates get close (by investing only in debt).

Suppose I want to buy a car worth 10L in 5 years and suppose my savings are 1L pm, I'll continue investing for retirement and switch to saving for the car in the last 10-12 months. This seems tax efficient too, I'm only redeeming my gains in the final few investments. 

Idk if this is a good strategy so this is not advice but I don't see how goal based planning beats this."
"I've been offered a promotion, was forceful on salary and my boss freaked out, is avoiding me","Yes, this is a common downside to the confrontational school of salary negotiation.  Either she will get over it and you can start negotiating again, or she has taken offense and is looking for alternatives to fill the offered position, and possibly backfill your current position too.  Not all organizations have the ""it's just business"" mindset for this kind of hardball negotiation to work well."
"What r/fatFIRE can learn from the book, Psychology of Money","I actually just finished reading the book yesterday, read it all in about 3 hours.  I must say it is one of the most well written finance/FI books I have read.

Why is Japanese public debt so high? How is it sustainable?,"If I had to guess, I'd say it's that despite Japanese public debt being relatively high, there's very little private debt.  So the total external debt is not that high relative to other countries (such as the UK or Switzerland).  

This is especially true when we look at things like the Net International Investment Position:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net\_international\_investment\_position 

Where, combining private and public debt / credit, Japan is actually a net creditor.  In other words, more countries or companies outside of Japan owe money to either Japanese government or Japanese companies than the other way around.

Extracting private credit to pay off public debt is probably difficult, but I think investors have confidence that some portion of the Japanese economy would be able to repay it. 

But here's a somewhat recent NBER working paper on the topic that is far more informative than I could ever be:

https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\_papers/w19596/w19596.pdf"
Anyone else feeling like a dumb piece of shit?,"Hey dude - don’t let your happiness be dictated by the whims of the market - just DCA and focus on other things in life.

I know this can get a bit overwhelming and addictive and I’ve been in that headspace.  I started with like 15k back in July 2020 in the markets and have just been adding in, sometimes taking profits, sometimes stuffing up and losing money especially in my early days.  I’m now sitting on about 47k across my ASX and Crypto investments, and much of it is attributed to simply putting in more as well as making profits along the way and reinvesting.

Today was a red day (down 4%, $1,500 on paper) and I don’t mind anymore, I just buy more each month with my paycheck and I stick to solid companies that are overlooked with a few small caps too/speculatives.  Diversify out, and have fun as you do it, dont have short term expectations no one can time the market perfectly.

Hope that helps mate"

Edit: In-case you're curious, the former SEC chairman, **Jay Clayton** (brought in during the Trump administration) just took a job at **Apollo Global Management** (which \[Tiger Global Management\] holds a 14.8% stake in, making them the largest shareholder of Apollo other than a private holdings company from Apollo themselves (BRH) ([https://fintel.io/so/us/apo](https://fintel.io/so/us/apo)));

Another fun fact is that the old CEO of **Apollo**  just stepped down last month because of his ties with **Jeffery Epstein** lol.

Lets not forget about **Mr. Heath Tarbert**, who was the former chairmen of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) who just got hired by Kenny boy as one of his Chief Legal Officers at Citadel not even 2 weeks ago. **Heath** had this to say about his friend **Jay Clayton**.

Do we have any estimate of how much the average person's standard of living could actually be raised by aggressive wealth redistribution?,"Are you talking about just the US, or the whole world? The following answer assumes just the US; per-adult numbers would be an order of magnitude lower for the whole world.

The US has [mean wealth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult) of about $500,000 per adult. So naively you might think that you could redistribute that and make every married couple a millionaire and give every adult half a million dollars.

In reality, if you tried to do this, a large chunk of the population would try to start selling stocks and bonds immediately, causing asset prices to crash, and also causing the price of consumer goods to skyrocket. The former would be somewhat mitigated by investors in other countries taking advantage of the fire sale, but the US has about 30% of [the world's wealth](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/), so there would still be a pretty big crash.

So that's a pretty terrible idea. Another option is to give everyone a non-transferable stake in the nation's wealth. So everyone would get $500,000 in assets, but wouldn't be able to sell them, and would instead receive a dividend of, say, 3%. That would yield $15,000 per year. This would be a bit under 20% of GDP, which is plausible.

Think of that as an optimistic upper limit of what could be accomplished with extremely aggressive wealth redistribution. Keep in mind that this would redistribute ownership of *all* wealth, so every adult with a net worth of more than $500,000 would lose out, and someone with a net worth of $250,000 would only get half as much benefit as a person with zero net worth.

If this were done with a credible guarantee that it would never happen again, I do think that there would be quite a lot of economic damage due to a big chunk of GDP being directed away from investment and towards present consumption, but the economy would likely recover.

If it were done on an ongoing basis, so that every time your net worth increased above average the excess got redistributed, it would likely be catastrophic. There would be no incentive to save money or start a new company. People would just spend all their money as soon as it came in.

Less aggressive redistribution would be less damaging, but also have less of a benefit. Redistributing the wealth of all the billionaires net of the first billion (currently about $4 trillion) would only yield enough to pay a dividend of a few hundred dollars per person per year. According to the [SCF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/table/), the top 1% has about $40 trillion; IIRC the cutoff for the top 1% is around $10 million. That would give about $150,000 per adult; at 3% that would yield a dividend of $4500 per year.

This would encourage people to liquidate and spend as needed to keep under the $10 million threshold, which would divert resources away from investment and towards present consumption. It would probably discourage entrepreneurship by the most highly skilled workers, since a $10 million net worth is something that a highly intelligent person can reasonably aspire to reach through working in finance, tech, law, or medicine.

So I am very explicitly not endorsing this plan. But I think that a UBI of $4-5,000 per year per adult is probably the most that could be no hoped for by confiscating all wealth over $10 million, if you very optimistically assume no harmful effects on growth."

How low is too low for INTC?,Investment yrs for companies are tough on stock. If they ever get in a pickle they could sell some of their 214k patents. Motorola did this in the 90’s. They could also cease dividend. I’ve been buying on the way down since $40. I’ve always made money on $intc. Might take time.
Complete newbie with significant net worth,"Please guard your money very carefully. People will start coming out of the woodwork to “help” you invest your money. Not all of them are honest. 

Before you decide to do anything, put yourself in front of a tax accountant who specializes in real estate investing. I’d suggest finding one that actually owns investment real estate.

Consider if you need to move to a state with lower/no state taxes. 

How much management do you want to undertake? Do you want to be taking the desperate calls for overflowed toilets at 3:00am? If you’ve never invested in real estate, you may be overwhelmed with maintenance and, more importantly, rent collection issues. Real estate management IS a high stress job. 

So back to you having funds in dividend ETF’s: why not live off of the dividends? 5% of that $3M is $150,000. There are a lot of places where you can live nicely off of just those dividends. But you may need to move to a lower/zero state tax area. Consider buying a personal residence and tax credits for that. 

Am I saying you should not invest in real estate? No! But I am saying to take your time and discover if it’s right for you. Find a way to reduce your costs, explore your hobbies and volunteer activities, and dip into investing s-l-o-w-l-y. Good luck!"
Amazon Prime Subscription,"Amazon is now putting people in the uncomfortable position of having to evaluate whether or not I get any value out of Prime Video as that seems to be driving the costs increase.  If you don't use that, it is becoming less attractive for the free shipping."
Invisible Hand?,"So at some point,  I think everyone studying economics becomes truly blown away by the efficiency of the price system.  Like prices are really fascinating and in a perfectly competitive market, that is,  where a few assumptions hold true, like that no individual firm can set the price (often said as firms are ""price takers""). Also usually assumed is that buyers are rational (they always prefer more over less), all products are the same (homogeneous), no barriers to entering or exiting the market, prefect information of buyers and sellers, there's a few others but the only other one I find particularly relevant is the assumption of no externalities, it's probably the most important one, ill get to it last. 

So first, you probably notice that perfect competition sounds pretty hard to come by, and it is.  For one thing sometimes firms operate in ways where they can mess with the price,  common examples are OPEC, or oil companies like Standard Oil back in the day (in the US). But if you want more details here I can go into more specifics. 

Also real life usually means there are barriers to entering and exiting industries. This is particularly relevant to climate change, and specifically green energy. One important issue for green energy is that the research needed to make green energy affordable is expensive. This is a challenge for a new business, since they don't have revenue yet.  The business could ask for a loan,  but new businesses can be risky,  especially when renewable energy isn't the norm, maybe a capital market run by homo economicus (the perfectly rational being with perfect knowledge of the markets) would see the value in loaning to an up-and- coming solar energy business, but real people aren't always as good at this (let me know if you want more info here, this is more on how capital is distributed then related to your question). So in real life this is where the government steps in, you can read a bit about it here
 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061115/economics-solar-power.asp

But the main idea is that the government helps subsidize this new business because in real life there are barriers to entering the market. 

Now we should mention externalities. Namely this is when a transaction between 2 entities impact a third party.  They can be positive, like maybe a local bakery makes the whole block smell good. It doesn't cost the ppl on the block any money to enjoy the smell, and it doesn't cost the bakery or its customers any more money when people enjoy the smell of the baked goods. But externalities can also be negative.  

For example town A buys energy from business A, but in the process of making the energy business A pollutes a river where town B gets its water. Also let's say business B is a fishing business, and the pollution kills all the fish. Since this doesn't really impact town A or business A they will carry out their transaction without factoring in the effect it will have on town B or business B. Because of this the price town A pays will be too low, and because the price is too low, they will buy too much, ie business A will make too much energy and therefore make too much pollution. 

In economics we talk about how externalities cause a ""wedge"". For the time being,  we can think of a wedge as when the price of something is higher or lower then it should be, causing the account supplied and demanded to be too high or too low. 

The classic example of a wedge is taxes in a perfectly competitive market. Once taxes are introduced typically both the consumer and producer end up paying some portion of the tax. So once a tax is introduced consumers pay more for the same amount,  so they will buy less then they did before,  also producers see some of their profit go to the government, so they'll produce less. So overall taxes mean less of a good is exchanged. 

This ends up being great news in the case of negative externalities! If you remember, since neither town A or business A felt the cost of the pollution, they were exchanging too much energy, and therefore making too much pollution.  But taxes can be used to make ppl buy less of a good! From there it's about finding out how much tax revenue you need to keep the river clean. 

And now once the tax is in place your professor is right again! The market takes care of it! But as long as one of the assumptions I mentioned at the beginning is violated the market will typically need some kind of helping hand. 

The article I posted above also mentions how externalities factor into this situation.  Let me know if you want more detail,  and I can even try and break out my notes and do the math if you want, but probably not till tomorrow! Also sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile!"

"John Maynard Keynes predicted we'd all be massively wealthy and working 15-hour work weeks by now. He was ""right"" on the first front and wrong on the second. What happened?","&gt;So is the issue that inflation has eaten away at the gains, so the cost of necessities like housing, food, and clothing is more expensive than Keynes predicted?

No, this doesn't explain it. Even using [inflation-adjusted figures](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA), GDP per capita was 4x higher by the end of 2019 compared to 1947 (as far back as official figures go).

&gt;Is the problem that the wealth accumulation is real, but most of it accrued for the top 1%? Did Keynes assume it would be distributed equally?

I don't see that inequality can explain this. While it is true that inequality has risen in recent decades, inequality was also very high when Keynes first said this in 1928. It depends on how exactly you measure inequality, but [inequality levels](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2018.pdf) are either similar or just a bit higher today than at that time. You can also look at some European countries (such as those in Scandinavia) that have much lower levels of inequality. While they do tend to work less than the US on average, they aren't anywhere near 15 hours per week.

While Keynes badly missed on the actual figure, it is true that working hours have declined over time, not just in the US but in most wealthy countries. In 1950 (as far back as [this dataset](https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm) goes), workers worked an average of 37.7 hours per week. In 2020, it was 33.9 hours.

And Keynes may have just made a really bad estimate. Quoting [Ohanian (2008)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Back-to-the-Future-with-Keynes-*-Ohanian/8764f97aeae2e00af124a08811255ed2a2a29f2a):

&gt;Keynes does not provide any details on how he arrived at this forecast, and this raises the question of what economic theory or quantitative procedures he used to arrive at this number. The decline is much larger than a forecast produced from simply extrapolating the historical decline in hours worked. In particular, hours worked per capita declined about 10 percent in the United States between 1889 and 1929, and this same rate of decline between 1929 and 2029 generates a further 23 percent decline, far short of the two-thirds decline predicted by Keynes.

Without knowing how Keynes arrived at his estimate, it's hard to say what exactly he get wrong.

As a country becomes richer, there are two competing effects. The first, income effects in preferences, which basically states that leisure time becomes more valuable as you make more money. The second is the opportunity cost of leisure rises as your wage increases (called the ""substitution effect""). As an example, imagine you make $10/hour. If you wish to take a day off from work to visit the beach, your opportunity cost is $80 (assuming an 8 hour day). Now imagine you make $50/hour. Now your opportunity cost is $400. In this sense, making more money actually encourages you to work more. Generally, most research finds that income effects dominate substitution effects, but dominance [may weaken as countries become wealthier](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151720). Perhaps Keynes greatly over-estimated income effects or under-estimated substitution effects.

I have seen one other theory I found reasonably convincing: [increasing life expectancy](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2021/twerp_1360_-_crafts.pdf). Today, most people are retired much longer than in the past, which means that they accumulate a much greater amount of leisure time after retirement. However, this requires savings to draw from, which must be accumulated from working. Perhaps Keynes either didn't anticipate large increases in life expectancy, or didn't realize that most people would prefer to retire and experience their leisure in one ""lump sum"" rather than working 15 hours per week until 85.

I will note that I'm not all that familiar with the writings of Keynes, so maybe someone else that is more familiar here can provide a better context to what the thinking of Keynes may have been.

(As a side note, ""median GDP per capita"" doesn't exist. I assume you mean median income.)

EDIT: Also:

&gt;According to an inflation calculator, $8,220 in 2021 dollars is $132,501, far above the current per capita GDP. I'm sure some costs have fallen, but enough to offset that sort of inflation?

I'm fairly certain your original figures were already adjusted for inflation."

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that 🚀🚀🚀.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

🦍🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but 🍌🍌🍌 for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

My wife would like to retire,"Why not encourage her to quit and find something without the commute, which has better hours and is lower stress? Even if she makes half as much, it would make her feel better, and be a great compromise."
15 years old and I’m making £800-£1100/$1300 a week. What is a profitable item to mass sell?,"You’re only 15 so not in a hurry. Yes multiple income sources are a good idea, but that’s for when you are older.

You are already doing amazing, don’t go overboard. You still need to finish your education and have a social life. I think it’s more important to focus on developing your skills and do something smart with the money you earn now.

Getting passive income from the money you earn is a better idea. See if you can invest it in something, either in your own company if you have a great business idea to build from here (not a new business but working on the business you already have) or put it in an investment portfolio or if you understand crypto you might put a little into that (but spread it out, don’t put all in one place or all in crypto).

The pitfall here is that when you start a new business you have to split your attention and the risk is that you can only spend 50% on both, and then both only do average while you could work on one business that will do great. I am taking into account that you’re only 15 and you still have your education to finish. You don’t want your businesses to stand in the way of that.

If you do decide to do something else than find something that creates a passive income and doesn’t take up lots of your time. We don’t want you to burn out before graduation!

You are doing amazing. Just remember to not spend money on stuff you don’t need. Clothes and gadgets are usually bad investment for the long run. You need decent clothes, but you don’t need designer stuff that costs 1000’s and will be out of fashion next year. (Take it from a fashionista, you don’t need that shit now)"
"Economics expressed in Mathematical language? Set theory, calculus, algebra, statistics, Operations Research... what tools do I need to express economics rigorously?","This question is great, my suggestion is to start at higher level textbooks and work backwards - Math to theory instead of theory to math (since you already understand math, it's probably easier in that direction), for most people, the theory is the way to conceptualize the math/models.

You are completely right that the intro econ theory and math is similar to the perfect frictionless sphere in physics. Personally, I found micro to be more intuitive and the modelling closer to standard model construction learned in statistics classes. All the mathematical languages/concepts are useful in economics, but I would say statistics is probably dominant, followed by calculus, algebra, differential equations. set theory is useful for concepts, but I don't actually use it very often, more just useful to know.

&amp;#x200B;

For context: started in physics undergrad, transferred to math-econ, got econ MA, am employed as an analyst.

Are you by any chance finishing an undergrad and looking at options for grad school? If so, I would recommend just enrolling in 4th year econ micro/macro and then getting classmates to explain any theory concepts that don't make sense - trust me, you will  be able to pay them back when it comes to studying the math parts."
FCA finds that new investors have a high degree of self confidence and claimed knowledge,"""Driven by the popularity of apps""
No it's driven by record low savings rates.

My cash ISA is giving something like 0.05% I think.
Anything that gives a halfway decent rate (which at this point means about 0.5%) comes with strings attached like must pay in at least £1500 and spend at least £1000 per month to qualify plus have 2 direct debits etc.

There's a lot of people who are in low paid/part time jobs that wont meet the deposit or are living with parents and don't have direct debits or who simply don't spend enough per month.

If you can't get a decent return in savings you start looking elsewhere and for most people that will be the stock market. 


I bought some shares in an index fund in January and it was up 7% earlier this month. I bought a lot more and averaged up my cost and just 4 days later the % return is still higher than I'm getting on my ISA.


The apps just make it accessible."
In your opinion what is the worst part of dividend investing?,"I'd say the ""worst"" part of dividend investing is, unless you have a ton of starting capital, the slow game until your snowball starts moving.

Elizabeth Warren introduces legislation to extend moratorium on evictions for a whole year.,"As I said in the John Oliver post, evictions are not the answer to our current situation but you can't get rid of evictions for a year without taking the landlord's into consideration.

I think there's a debt crisis coming in the UK. Am I wrong? How do we hedge?,"It’s already happened - the bond market has contracted roughly 25% from roughly AA down to BBB bonds. There was some worry about a debt spiral as seen by the price of Credit Suisse CDS prices spiking around May. However energy bonds are outperforming everything else and returning positive yields - as you correctly said - people don’t have a choice when paying energy bills, but actually this means that they are more robust than ever - but don’t buy them as this is obviously already priced in. Energy companies are price gouging the shit out of everyone because a) profit b) it’s actually in the government interest. More expensive energy bills is a good thing - people save more money fixing supply side inflation. Yes mortgages are important - but most people are locked into a fixed rate which already takes into account rising interest rates - make no mistake, there will be defaults, but just because the interest rate will climb to around 4% - it doesn’t mean people will pay 4% - it’s made manageable by averaging out the interest over the term.
To be honest - investments aren’t looking good all round. Both equities and bonds at risk - so what’s the plan. Literally to average down your cost basis. Not necessarily just DCAing, but smartly lowering your cost average with big buys. Some rules are essentially don’t buy trash - stick with companies with wide margins, less consumer choice (like energy, water - but already priced in). We could see 3- 5 years of drawdown - who knows? Definitely don’t try and hedge currency risk - the UK is defo ahead of the US in terms of tackling inflation and selling MBS - but all this means is the dollar will catch up (its lagging) and you won’t make a return - so think of it as buying GBP 3 months behind.
The only thing that is fully inflation proof is US Government i bonds (inflation yielding bonds) that pay at or above the inflation rate. But there are limits to how much you can buy and their maturity terms - you can get these at treasurydirect.gov. 
Also stop saying a recession IS coming - yes, it’s not here yet - but it’s already fucking priced in. The market is a forward thinking mechanism - the thing that really matters to institutions is the projected rate hikes and like we saw with the US yesterday, although 75 bps hike is a negative thing, the market was BRACING for something worse, hence 75bps was a comforting sign that the fed is going to do what they say they will and so markets rebounded at that sense of security.
Just be savvy with your money and average down. Buy stocks that actually pay a divvy - some tech stocks may not yield for a while.
Happy investing bro."
Cucks over at Ausfinance,"People don't like a high dividend yield in long term holdings such as VDHG because of  tax drag. If a portion of the growth of VDHG comes out as income (in the form of a dividend), you are paying tax on the earnings (likely in a higher bracket) and cutting down the size of the investment. If VDHG decides to reinvest focus on growth instead (lower dividend yield), there will be no personal tax paid. When these long term holders decide to sell, they will be able to cop a 50% CGT discount and likely also be in a lower tax bracket as they have retired/ working minimal hours."

"I have $5,000 in cash what should I do with it?",I always recommend if you have money you don't need put it in index funds. It's boring and everyone knows it but it is stable and good returns over long time periods. If you want you could split it between crypto and index funds. If you want just pure raw income you could put it into QYLD/RYLD stock and get like $40/mo. Or you could buy nothing but icecream if you wanted. Choice is yours but there are no wrong answer.
Is there an economic reason for wages not being increased year-on-year in line with inflation?,"Wages for the most part *do* keep up with inflation, or rather exceed it.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49328855

https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6994/economics/uk-wage-growth/

But that's about economy wide trends. Every industry has their own reasons for why wage growth might be slow or not.

&gt;Or is it just selfishness of management?

That is not an argument. The price of labor is, like everything else, governed by supply and demand. Buyers want to pay as little as possible, sellers want to get as much as possible. What matters are the factors that influence what any side *can* demand.

But maybe you mean why aren't wages in some way directly tied to inflation? Well, because why would they be, and why would that be a good idea?

Nominal wages are what economists call ""downward sticky"". Everybody likes to be paid more, nobody likes to be paid less. But sometimes paying people less is necessary, generat during recessions, which isnalso a time where inflation picks up. Nominal wages remaining the same and inflation going up means real wages go down, which helps companies through recessions and helps to avoid the alternative, lower nominal wages, which can be difficult to implement, or layoffs, which obviously aren't too great.

Real wages are also sticky, and there's evidence that the inflation target of 2% strikes a good balance between real and nominal wage rigidities, leading to ultimately higher real wages.

http://ftp.iza.org/dp959.pdf

Also, ultimately wage growth is mostly driven by productivity growth. That's not evenly distributed through the economy, because productivity growth isn't evenly distributed through the economy, but it is the reason the average person at least earns higher wages over time."

The company in question sent him a $3000 check for 'supplies', and instructed him to deposit it immediately.

Twitter loses $5 billion in market value after Trump is permanently barred from the platform,"Regardless of one's feelings about Trump, he was unquestionably the best thing to ever happen for Twitter's business.

Now that they have banned him, not only have they upset the conservative half of the country as well as people that are against censorship in general. But it will even lower the engagement rate of the people that hate Trump because now they don't have their enemy to checkup on all the time and with conservatives leaving the platform, they will have less people to debate against and they will eventually start to get bored talking with people that have the same political opinion.

And if Trump gets on another platform like he said he would, not only will his supporters follow him to the competing platform, but his haters will have to follow him there as well so that they can continue their addiction of checking up on him and making fun of him.

And unlike the other Big Tech companies, Twitter has failed to diversify so they really cannot afford to have their user engagement rate go down.

I would stay far away from Twitter stock. I think that they will eventually go the way of Myspace."

"This rally is a mirage, we are only in the beginning stages of this recession","In the 2008/2009 recession, the S&amp;P 500 bottomed out in March of 2009 with unemployment at **8.7%**.

Unemployment hit **10%** (it's highest point) in October of 2009 and the S&amp;P 500 was 55% higher than it was in March, 7 months earlier with an 8.7% unemployment rate.

Why do PMs always lowball the landlords on what they think the property can rent for?,"Because it is easier. Most PM fees are based on a % of rent. That $400 a month difference only nets them $40 if their fee is 10%. If they instead rent it cheaply but have to spend almost zero time marketing it because it is below market rates means they can spend more time on other properties. That $40 could mean 10, 20, 30 hours more work for them."
When do you sell high yield dividend stocks?,"The time and price you bought at is irrelevant. It's actually just a simple question of opportunity cost.

If you think the company is undervalued or fairly valued you probably don't want to sell. If a company is overvalued and you think another investment will yield better returns you should consider reallocating your money. However, you need to include the transaction costs in your calculations."
DISCUSSION: Opinions on current market Hype and speculation.,"Good day to you too, fellow trader. 

To answer your question about new investors putting large sums into these stocks, any experienced trader will object to this. It is a good idea for new investors/traders to stay away from the hype, do their due diligence, and test the waters (deme account) before thinking about using their hard earned money. 

Currently it is a case of FOMO and gambling. The ones who profited off of these stocks entered long ago. Entering now (especially for new, inexperienced traders) would be gambling. 

Try to remember the situation that happened during the Bitcoin craze a few years ago. The ones who raked in massive profits were the ones who entered early AND knew what Bitcoin is. 

The ones who entered later, ended up having to borrow large sums of money in hopes of “riding the the wave.”

Happy trading :)"
First profitable month! But....,"I’ve mentioned this before but it might be enlightening for the endless thousands who’ve joined the sub since the GameStop influx: 

A couple of years back I foolishly agreed to mentor my nephew (around 19 at the time) when he decided to stick some money on forex against my advice. He’s a bright kid, engineering student, maths whizz etc. I knew he had the requisite intelligence for forex, but I also knew he had an impulsive personality and rarely did as he was told. 

Anyway, all went great for a while. He stuck to the rules I gave him and the basic high-probability setups, sent me his P&amp;L every couple of days for a chat- he appeared to understand the nature of the game. Then after a few losses he started revenge trading. Then he started gambling on coin-flips. He gave all sorts of bad excuses for not sending his P&amp;L, trying to buy himself time while he sorted out the mess which just got worse and worse. Within a short space of time he’d lost about a third of his account and his father (my brother) and I got into a massive argument because it turned out he’d been using his university funds. 

So I gave him an ultimatum: either make back the losses or go it alone. His dad gave him an even bigger ultimatum- make back that money or leave the house. I found the whole process a nightmare and I’ll never do it again. But he took some time out, used his term breaks to read serious content, used a demo for a while. 

Making back your losses is a psychological trial as much as anything but he managed to pull it off and it taught him valuable lessons about risk. He’s since doubled the account and come to realise that he basically had no control over his emotions, and that his expectations were absurd. 

Any significant drawdown is a major issue for a simple reason that’s lost on most people: if you lose 20% of your equity you now have to earn **25%** just to get back to your starting capital. Lose 30% and you now have to earn 42%...etc etc. 

And yet it all boils down to the same basic reality that the vast majority of newer retailers don’t grasp until it’s too late: greed kills accounts. Greed is expressed in trading in the form of irrational profit targets combined with irrational risk exposure; the worst combo you can have. Making even 0.25% ROI on a trade is a success, but very few retailers seem to comprehend this. So instead they impose absurd profit targets and end up losing that 0.25% because price reverts and now they’re stopped out. 

If a retailer ever learns just one lesson in forex it should be this: **You will never go broke taking profits**. Bank them and walk away. Small gains regularly banked = long-term growth."

Berkshire's annual meeting - A few takeaways that won't make headlines,"Having only listened to the first hour and watched some clips here and there. My exact thoughts too about the farmland analogy.

"Warren Buffett: ""Interest rates act like gravity on valuation.""","When interest rates are high, people will be more likely to sell stocks to buy bonds because the return will be good and the risk is close to 0. When interest rates are low, people seeking return will only be able to invest in riskier assets like stocks and commodities and such if they want a reasonable percentage return."
TransUnion burying their credit freeze to sell their own credit monitoring product TrueIdentity,"The credit bureaus have collected information without consumers direct permission and are refusing to protect it unless given $16.95 a month. Blackmailing with browser history or compromising pictures pale in comparison to what the credit bureaus are now doing. Even the Mob doesn’t have it this easy.  Consumers had better play-along ‘or else’ their ability to participate in modern society will be crippled.

Equifax stands to make a lot of money selling monitoring for information they failed to protect. Charging 5-15 dollars to lock accounts will net them up to 3.0 billion dollars. Equifax also charges to unlock and lock it again. If consumers are willing to sign all their rights away Equifax will give consumers a year of security monitoring with no promise to fix your credit if it is impacted. If you actually want protection it’s $16.95 a month. That's a potential of billions of dollars a month to protect something collected without your direct permission and then lost. This seems so close to blackmail it is mind boggling. On Equifax's word; you could be prevented from getting a job, having credit cards, buying a house or car.  One-hundred fifty million people are now completely exposed moving forward everyone will require credit monitoring which really is just the credit bureau's expanding their reach into consumers pockets.  

Even worse Credit monitoring isn’t a guarantee of anything. Most products only promise to tell you you have been compromised you still have to go through the pain and fixing it with the small hope you can fight them to have expenses reimbursed. At least the Mob offers some actual protection from your shop being burnt down or robbed, credit monitoring doesn’t even do that. Although, you will get a text on your phone at some point after the fire begins.

Meanwhile, Equifax will go from a measly gross profit of 3.1 billion last year to the potential of 2-5 billion a month.  How could they resist not leaking your information for returns like that? Congrats Equifax you just turned credit monitoring into a massive growth industry and all it took was gross negligence. And Just like the Mob they didn’t burn your shop down they just can’t stop it, unless of course, you pay $16.95 a month.

T+21 theory for FTDs is confirmed with a a spike on the 26th and a rise in aftermarket and then a slow taper.....this has literally been happening like clockwork

MACD is crossing on the 5 month

We can hope to see a possible increase and spike in the next 10-20 days (i am not saying this will be the moass)

BUT on the other hand....reversal (a single major red day or multiple small red days or sideways trading) on the way leading up to the spike might make this MACD cross not pan out


Anyways...
I am bullish on GME for sure, the general vibes are bullish too, we have more people joining the fight (THE ANTS!), and apes who had 1 share in january now have 10, apes with 10 now have a 100, apes with a 100 now have a 1000.

Bittrex holding my about $100.000 hostage with no response to support ticket/email for almost three months,"Jesus that's a horror story, 

Forget email, try calling them at (866) 554-0350. If it just keeps directing you to a message box, try reaching out to the Nevada Attorney General office for guidence, because Bittrex LLC is incorporated in Las Vegas. Their Las Vegas LLC may be a shell to hide the real ownership, but you should be able to get what state their parent corp is.

I searched ""Bittrex"" on FinCEN (money service businesses must register with FinCEN to obtain a money transmitter license) and apparently the address they have there is in Redmond, WA and the company is actually called ""Bittrex, Inc"", try it yourself:

https://www.fincen.gov/msb-state-selector

You can try to get a CFPB complaint filed, its a government financial services protection organization and should be able to reach Bittrex:

https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/

/r/bittrex is filled with similar frustrations, one guy is saying that they actually complained to BBB and BBB reached out to Bittrex which caused them to update the ticket and move the funds. I doubt this will work but worth a try.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bittrex/comments/7r5lkf/i_got_bittrex_to_answer_my_ticket_see_inside_for/

Also if this persists for any longer than another month, I would lawyer up. $100,000 is a lot of money and Bittrex is still a US corporation, you shouldn't let your money taken hostage like that. If you can find out their actual contact info (its probably what FinCEN has in their registration form) and get your lawyer to send them a request, they may perk up. Its one thing to get angry emails and support tickets, its another thing when an actual letter from a lawyer's office shows up at your mailbox.

My advice to anyone is to avoid Bittrex and Bitfinex (far too many horror stories about these two), and generally keep large balances off exchanges and in your wallet. If you're trading 6 figure balances you want to be at an insured and licensed exchange, the only exchange I would recommend is Gemini for US investors if you want to actually cash out. I managed to pull out just under $470,000 in fiat from Gemini using the Gemini Auction and they were very responsive and professional, guided me through the entire thing including what I need to provide to my bank to avoid getting flagged for potential money laundering. Avoid any exchange where its ownership and corporate structure is so unclear. If you cant figure out who is actually liable for complaint, what capital reserve requirements and banking compliance standards are being followed by an exchange, avoid them."
"PSA: If You recently left Robinhood, double check your transferred cost-basis!","I complained to FINRA. timely and accurate transmittal of cost basis information is part of ACATS requirements.

edit: Since this comment got some attention I want to share some of the follow-up. Once I mentioned the complaints to regulatory agencies RH managed to figure out what they needed to do to make it work and **my cost basis was transmitted to the receiver.** Not always the correct strike price, but correct initial investment numbers are now at my new brokerage. 

**Do not reply to RH emails**, even though they say you can - **all email is bouncing**. Go to the **web contact form each time** or your requests will not make it into their support system. I sent a new request every day for a week until it showed up, remaining polite but informing them each day that each day of additional delay was noted. 

I did also **complain to SEC**. While FINRA has not yet responded, SEC auto-replied after 5 calendar days. I also complained to my state (CA) department of consumer affairs.

**Good recordkeeping is key to making consumer complaints that result in action.** I don't like companies that treat myself or others poorly; Making official complaints is one of my hobbies. Yes, I'm grumpy AF. Creating documentation and leaving a paper trail is important."
Some of my friends think it’s stupid for me to prefer renting a house over buying one. Thoughts?,"Many people recommend buying a home because it's a method of forced savings. Simply by paying the monthly mortgage, you're building up equity. 

It sounds like renting is definitely right for you. However, make sure you build up wealth in other ways: in your Roth IRA, 401k, taxable brokerage account, etc."
"Seriously, just be nice.","Thanks for this post, I've held back posting here or on any other financial sub. My situation give me so much anxiety and when you add insult to injury, it really sends me to a very dark place of self harm. My situation is by no fault of me do to a work injury and it seems like the programs out there are designed to keep that boot on my head while stuck in the mud."
"Today, I lost my savings and my career","Maybe you’re still just in shock but it sounds like you’re taking this well. I have mental wellness issues of my own (Bipolar) and I can understand that sometimes we do things that don’t make sense in the long term because it seems in the heat of the moment to be the right thing to do.

And that’s really it. If you start to feel bad for the poor decision, you have to also remind yourself that you weren’t in the right mindset. If you had been thinking clearly then perhaps it wouldn’t have happened. You can’t blame yourself for being human and making a mistake that is very easy to make for even the most experienced of traders. 

Hopefully you’ll remember this as an unfortunate mistake and not a moment that defines who you are. There’s a difference between someone who is greedy and impulsive vs. someone who simply did something wrong that would be otherwise out of character.

Don’t punish yourself for this. Sure, the consequences will have to be dealt with, but there’s no reason you should have to suffer more. These kinds of losses can be embarrassing and humiliating but they aren’t defining or permanent. 

Give yourself time to process this before you start to look for solutions- allow yourself enough time to clear your mind and think rationally. If your life can be “ruined,” then it can also be built up again. Equal possibility."
Inheriting 500k,"I had a similar thing happen in my life. It makes me really happy that you're not telling your family about this. I come from a toxic family too, and this is 100% what I did. Having a good secret like this can be so freeing: you will always privately know that you can just walk away from the family poison whenever you want. In my experience, that secret knowledge can change your life as much as the money itself can. I try to live by the adage, ""Have more than you show; tell less than you know."" It's a little piece of power you keep in your pocket. All the best to you in the limitless life ahead, stranger!"
"Is it true that a small percentage of your taxes goes to social programs, while the vast majority goes to military?","No, not even close. Almost the inverse is true. See [here](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/spending/categories/), or [this chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/2020_US_Federal_Budget_Infographic.png). 

Broadly speaking, the federal government spends in two categories. Mandatory (sometimes called entitlement) spending is setup in advance. Usually, some bill passed decades ago setup the spending program and how it changes each year. Discretionary spending is determined in annual appropriations bills. Congress and the President have a lot more, well, discretion with how much they spend here. Defense is less than half of discretionary spending, and discretionary spending is about a quarter of federal spending. The result is that defense/military spending is about 10% of what the government spends. 

2020 isn't a perfectly representative year, but social security, medicare, medicaid, paycheck protection program, and unemployment payments amounted to about half of federal spending. 

It comes down to this. Most of our social programs are paid through mandatory spending, and our military is paid in discretionary spending. Bad faith (or misinformed) actors will elide the massive scale of mandatory spending and pretend discretionary spending is the only thing."
Memes Kill Financial Subs - Change My Mind,"No, maybe, depends.

Yes, memes might create group-think and endless feedback loops in some cases.

But, memes also allow a much more open discussion of ideas and also experiences. Would there ever be open discussions of trades gone wrong without a “loss porn” culture? Would there be “reckless” exploration and actual experience of crazy ideas without a meme driven culture? 

I tend to think that memes can benefit trading subs in that sense. Encouraging them to try out things they wouldn’t have done otherwise and thus also expanding their minds.

What it means is that meme-driven trading subs have a higher potential but also maybe an inevitable demise into rehashing the same old stocks.

I fucking hate ethical ETFs.,"Although I agree with a lot of this post in terms of how Ethical funds operate, I think this is akin to the 'drop in the ocean analogy' when it comes to fixing climate change. Because it's a global issue, your $10,000 investment into the ETF does nothing in the greater scheme of things. But the truth is a lot of people are passionate about the environment, and it's only through the combined actions of many that changes could be influenced. A good example of how this collective impact changes the minds of businesses is the recent decision of ANZ to no longer fund coal power plant projects from last October. Providing this funding would likely be a valuable source of revenue for ANZ, but they've actively decided not to, in the interests of the bank's reputation. Although not directly attributed to  ethical investors, it's clearly an example of a decision that is made to improve the reputation of ANZ at the expense of potential profits.

Another thing to note is that ethical funds might also be focused around ESG and hence the monitoring of 'Governance' is also a valuable factor. Poor governance can be a leading indicator into a company's failings, or at least identify an elevated risk for a company, if some things aren't adding up. Just look at how scandals have taken AMP apart over the last 5 years.

Having said this, I've seen what I would call abuses of the name 'ethical' fund to enforce another active management opinion under the guise of being 'ethical'. For example, when the Betashares Sustainability ETF removed it's investment in Tesla, for concerns around controversies and reputational issues, including misleading reports around Tesla's water usage for it's factory in Berlin. If a fund manager can't recognise how a single  company has transformed the entire auto industry to go electric, then I think this fund manager has no business being in the Sustainability sector or claiming to be.

And yes, any deviation from the index is active management and yes in general, most active managers fail to outperform the benchmark. The difference here is the goal of the fund is not to outperform. It's catering to a growing segment of the market who care about the type of companies they invest in. Furthermore, one could argue that as the pressures and impacts of climate change worsen, companies that are within the sustainability sector are more likely to benefit from favourable government incentives and will have additional catalysts in helping their business models grow. So one could argue that yes over the next 10-20 years they could outperform.

Also, 37 basis points is not an exorbitant management fee. It's actually very reasonable, as long as the manager is doing their job in monitoring their portfolio and potential new entrants/exits.

You are clearly someone who invests for the goal of maximising profits through the tried and true method of index investing. This is great, and I don't think ethical ETFs are for you, but for others, they might be.

Where did the houses go?,"Planet Money [did a wonderful episode on this](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/30/1022827659/three-reasons-for-the-housing-shortage), which I'd recommend.

There are a few contributing causes here:

* After the great recession circa 2008, home building [dropped to its lowest level in decades](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IUSNHP_IUSHS_chart.png) and did not meaningfully recover afterwards. This meant that **new construction has not been keeping up with population growth** for the last decade or so — we're now seeing the echo of that event.[^(1)](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/10/the-u-s-real-estate-market-in-charts/)
* There are **systemic incentives against folks working in the trades**, and this has been building up for decades — carpentry, plumbing, and masonry trades are all skilled work, but *young people don't want to get into that kind of work* because we've both financially and culturally disincentivized it — after all, who dreams of being a plumber? We're seeing the blowback from this now, as well.[^(2)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/property-report/article-construction-industry-fears-a-skilled-trades-shortage/)
* Meanwhile, we've seen **reductions in immigration** — particularly illegal immigration, where the discount compensations of workers from that class were keeping construction costs artificially low. [^(3)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-immigrants-us-jobs-economy-farm-workers-taxes/) [^(4)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/10/a-majority-of-americans-say-immigrants-mostly-fill-jobs-u-s-citizens-do-not-want/)
* ***Zoning*** **has not kept up** with the needs of the population, wherein many cities have prohibited the building of duplexes and multiplexes in favour of single-family dwellings, which are perceived to be of 'higher value' to municipalities and are easier to sell/manage. This problem is known as the ""missing middle"" problem, and I encourage you to read about it as it's a fascinating area of active conversation in urban planning circles.[^(5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_middle_housing)
* **This is all compounded by COVID**. A significant percentage (40%+) of the workforce is now working from home.[^(6)](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/06/29/snapshot-new-working-home-economy/) That means what matched up to individuals' needs no longer works anymore. If you lived in a studio before, you now feel like you can justify a one bedroom plus den/office. We all feel like we need more space, everyone is trying to move up, and it's created a rush in the market.
* Finally, **the baby boomer effect**. Boomers are still working, and healthier than any previous generation of the same age has ever been. They're not moving out of their houses and into nursing homes. More than any other previous generation, they're choosing to *grow old in the houses they already have*, and this means there's a lack of availability for younger generations to move up.[^(7)](https://globalnews.ca/news/5345954/boomers-not-downsizing/)

All these reasons together are creating a shortage, and that's part of what's made it such a tough pickle to fix."
I fucking hate ethical ETFs.,"Interesting post. I agree with some of it, but I'd like to put forward an alternative view.

You say that lowering the share price of the ""bad"" companies doesn't achieve anything. I disagree. 

Firstly, lower share price means their executives receive less money from their stock options and bonuses. In other words, if ethical funds were a significant market force, there would be a direct rational self interest motive for CEOs to steer their companies towards the path of ""good"".

Secondly, it makes it harder to get finance. A company with well-performing shares can raise capital easily by selling more shares.

Thirdly, when I buy shares in an ETF the fund gets to vote on my behalf. I would rather that vote be an ethical one than a short term greedy one.

So for these reasons I think ethical investment is still worthwhile.


I completely agree that direct action is **more** worthwhile. So I'll throw in my own suggestions to add to OPs great list: 

* Buy quality things and maintain/repair them. When your washing machine starts to make funny noises, tighten or replace the belt, don't buy a whole new Hisense machine that's destined for landfill in 3 years.

* You don't need a new mobile phone every two years just because your $80/m contract includes one. Mobile phones are perfectly serviceable for **at least** 4 years, and if you need to get a battery replaced the shop in the mall will do it, using far less resources than a new phone.

* Aiming for instant perfection in your spending habits is a fool's errand. Instead try to consistently get a little bit better. Changing habits is a classic tortoise/hare scenario."
Everyone is talking GME and AMC.... meanwhile....,"Nice amount of dividends, but you might want to also consider looking into stocks that have a good dividend growth rate. I normally try to only buy dividend stocks with at least an 8% dividend growth rate, or close to it.

It may not pay much today, but I love my Microsoft stock, and they've been averaging just under a 10% dividend growth rate over the last 5 years."
"Until the current market hysteria passes, shall we cut down on referencing thetagang outside the sub?","I was also thinking about taking the sub private not being the worst idea at all, at this time. WSB has deteriorated into an annoying hellhole, and I’m actually sad because it used to be a fun place. Perhaps it regenerates in a few months.

A town outside of Rome is selling neglected homes for a little more than $1 — but buyers must commit to renovating them within 3 years,"Maenza is 95.5 km from Rome, or a 97 minute drive in good conditions. There are 1,328 families, living in this town that already has 1,887 homes. There are no notable educational institutions, major malls, etc. in close proximity.

Given the property taxes, upkeep, and likely no rental income, this is still a losing prospect I'm afraid. 

It's an interesting idea, but the town should channel funds into local amenities first. They have fantastic scenic scapes, and this looks like a good spot for an education hub to be honest. That's where they money needs to go : /"
Is socialism a system possible to achieve ? Most philosophers appear to be socialist according to the latest Philpapers survey.,"Economists generally don't deal with such ""systems"" as their definitions are not sufficient to really be able to talk about them in a scientific context. Basically, the question ""what is socialism"" has too many answers, none of them good enough.

""Can we implement socialism"" is not a good question, ""can we implement policies X, Y and Z"" is."
"Report: 'Minimum wage workers are unable to afford rent anywhere in the United States' - I shared this report with my friends who are unaware of my difficult upbringing, and I was saddened to find out that none of them cared.

Were you in the right group/chatroom? Were you on topic? Did you drop the link and then say *nothing* about it? 

Did you *ask them what they thought about it*?

It's entirely possible that they didn't react because they didn't see it at all, didn't see the relevance of it (especially if the place you posted the link is a meme board or otherwise totally outside that topic), or didn't care/know enough to respond.

"How can politics be separated from cold, hard economical science?","Popular media (and Reddit, in particular) presents economics the academic field as much more divided than it really is. Broadly, there aren't ""schools of thought"" in mainstream economics, and there's a pretty high degree of consensus around issues where there is established research. The [IGM forum](https://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/) polls US and EU economists on various current issues, and there's usually a pretty large amount of agreement within economists about what the academic consensus on an issue is. That's not to say there isn't any disagreement, but it's much less than what the media portrays. A lot of that is because the media is 1) interested in conflict, 2) tends to promote not-actual-economists as economists and 3) tends to only cover a small slice of economics (macro). The third point is particularly relevant because most people are not familiar with economic research. I do mostly housing and public transport research, so I might ask to what extent a new train line will raise rent prices, which definitely won't make it to CNN.

Where you'll find more disagreement is when there isn't a lot of research on a topic. Current levels of inflation are a good example. There's no research on how pandemics affect inflation in global economies. There's a lot of research on related issues, but we're very much extrapolating out of sample. This leads to more disagreement than on something like how a child tax credit will affect child poverty where we have much better research. There's also disagreement on normative implications of research. Two economists might agree on the same set of facts, but they might place different weights on outcomes. Policies often have tradeoffs, economists are people, and people value the tradeoffs differently. That's not an issue of economic research, but it does mean that economics can never be truly abstracted from politics.

If you were going to go at economic research for being biased, I think the biggest critique is that economics as a profession is s[hockingly not-diverse](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221). Economic research might not be biased, but people choose what to research in large part based on their life experiences Someone who grew up low-income whose parents didn't go to college will ask very different questions than someone who grew up middle class. I grew up taking the bus everywhere so I'm much more sensitive to issues of public transit than most people are. The questions we ask are ultimately as important as the answers we end up getting, and to that extent economics does a poor job of representing a wide array of backgrounds.

Edit: If anyone is curious about what economic research looks like -- or at least what questions are asked-- I would suggest taking a look at the [journal of economic perspectives.](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep)"
The Dumb Man's Guide to Riches,"My recommendation is: Somnologist - a sleep doctor.

Stay with me here.  You literally add no value.  A shaved ape could do this job.  100% of your appointments are 9 - 5, there are no 2am emergencies in sleep medicine.  You don't have to deal with feet, you don't have to deal with teeth, you never TOUCH a patient.  You can do this job ENTIRELY over video conferencing!  You just act as a gate keeper where your only role (in all honestly) is to allow people to purchase totally automated equipment that is COMPLETELY SAFE that solves their problems of being tired.  Try to avoid telling patients about the ""SleepyHead"" open source software that makes your job obsolete.  Of course you run it yourself to read the output and find out what to tell patients, but don't tell the patients that.

You have to learn a very basic table of diagnosis that can fit on one 8.5""x11"" piece of paper.  If your patient is tired, prescribe CPAP (or BiPAP or whatever) and see if they improve.  If you are super thorough do a blood panel looking for thyroid issues and a list of about 3 other things.  Since something like 30% of people over 50 years old should be using a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) but don't know it, this is a gold mine for wasted doctors fees.   For bonus points the modern CPAP devices are modern technological miracles, they are totally automated - the doctor adds zero value - the machines adjust themselves on the fly.  The modern CPAP machines are literally sleep studies in a box - they tell patients and doctors EVERYTHING about what is going on.  Restless leg syndrome: well the patient is screwed, but you could pretend the drug Gabapentin works and that will string the patient along for a couple of years paying the doctor when in reality it doesn't do much.  And there are a couple of other diagnosis on the bottom half of the 8.5""x11"" piece of paper I won't bother going into.

Learn to say ""sleep hygiene"" with a straight face even though it does nothing for 80% of patients and literally EVERYBODY in the field knows it's an insurance thing.  The insurance companies prefer putting up artificial barriers to getting real treatment, and this is their ""go to"".   Your job is milking patients of money while adding no value, so telling them to practice ""sleep hygiene"" and see if it helps for 6 months or a year is a great way to keep those expensive doctor fees flowing.

If after a couple of years your patients look like walking zombies, prescribe a combination of CPAP, Modafinil, and Ambien.  Although the insurance companies will suggest cheaper alternatives that don't work as well, at least you tried.

There is no better path for an incompetent doctor (or barely competent doctor) who can't do anything else, and still wants to fatFIRE.  Nothing but easy hours and pure profit."
Where do Economists lean politically on socioeconomic issues ?,"[This research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Solon_Simmons/publication/228380360_The_Social_and_Political_Views_of_American_Professors/links/5b4fcad5aca27217ffa201b5/The-Social-and-Political-Views-of-American-Professors?origin=publication_detail) (which I believe Lawrence Summers commented on but I can't find any info on it) suggests that Economics professors are largely left learning although many are independent (see table 8). It's important to remember that Economics is a science meaning it tends to focus on positive questions rather than normative ones and so in highly regarded papers, ideological concerns aren't a primary driver of the results (I.e. Raj Chetty vs Art Laffer). I know you mentioned bachelor's, but I would be hesitant to call any of them ""economists"". Most bachelor's students don't have a title that's called an economists (which is a stupid threshold to be an economist but I'm just making a point) and many of them who are interested in economic research I.e. being an economist tend to go through graduate school. I'm also of the opinion that from my own experience, undergrad doesn't prepare you at all to comprehend and have strong critiques of economic research in the same way a graduate degree might (although there are certainly undergrads who spend a lot of time engaged in the research like /u/BainCapitalist). Many undergraduate programs focus on theory classes with a few papers thrown in and very few of them focus solely on research designs. Even many undergrad level econometrics classes aren't sufficient to completely understand most, if any, of metrics in modern papers. Therefore, while still valid, I would be really careful conflating the opinions of an economic researcher and an undergraduate in economics. 

In general however, it shouldn't be a surprise that [many economists advocate for policy that is backed by the best available research regardless of political leanings](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/climate-change-policies) and are also largely in favor of ""market-oriented policy"". I think free-market is kind of a modern strawman as many people twist it into some hyperlibertarian view that is synonymous with ""trickle down economics"". It's also important to note that economics has a surprising amount of consensus (largely due to a lot of high quality research) around many issues and effects, and debates within the economics community tend to center around newer research and less tested policy. These debates also tend to focus around [methodology](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/10/29/774091313/is-the-american-tax-system-regressive) and critiques of some of the research that may affect the results.

The last thing I'd be careful is mistaking the opinions of Reddit and the internet for the opinions that most people hold IRL. [Obama said it best](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/obama-woke-cancel-culture.amp.html) that you can't fuse [social media] political culture with the nuances of the real world. The massive echo chambers of any politically tangential subreddit tends to polarise most people. Also, a really good heuristic is anybody who says that a solution is ""just economics 101"" you can largely throw out their opinion as completely uneducated. Economic *research* is how economists form the basis of their opinions and **not** high school level *theory*. At the same time, you can also generally throw out the opinion of someone who [does one of these](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/lazy-econ-critiques.html?m=1) as they're also going to be unaware of the general literature as well. 

Sorry for the long post, but one of my biggest pet peeves are the Redditors who are of the type that say ""economics=politics"" (not saying that's you but it's a common thing I see online) but really have no idea what the discipline is like."

How was the Euro's initial value determined?,"Before the Euro, every country has its own currency - e.g. French franc, Deutsche mark, Italian lira, etc. However, there was something called the European Currency Unit which was part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism or ""snake in the tunnel"". 

The ECU was a basket of European currencies (including currencies which ultimately did not join the Eurozone like Denmark and the UK - and not including currencies which did join the Eurozone like Austria and Finland) used to effectively peg every European currency to each other, and the Euro replaced the ECU on a 1:1 basis. In practice, due to relative economy sizes, it was heavily dominated by Germany, France, the UK, and the Netherlands - with large contributions from Belgium and Italy. 

It was called a snake in a tunnel because each currency (the snake) was meant to fluctuate within an upper and lower limit (the tunnel) vs the ECU. The range was quite small at ±2.25%, except for Spain/Portugal/UK which was allowed ±6%. The ratios of each country's weighting was fixed, so this effectively kept them fixed to each other within the range. The ECU never actually traded and was never used for anything else other than determining this mechanism.

This system actually worked decently well at limiting the variance of each currency vs the other currencies. One major issue was that it required countries to defend that range, which was easier when countries were actually part of an integrated European economy, and very difficult when they weren't. The UK joined the tunnel in 1992, but had a much worse economy than the rest of Europe, featuring high interest rates and high inflation. Ultimately, within just 2 years it couldn't afford to defend the bottom end of the range and was forced to leave, triggering Black Wednesday."
Warren Buffett Way,"Let's suppose A Corporation reported a Net Income of $100 million dollars. The company can: 1. Pay out  cash dividends to shareholders. 2. Buy back stock from shareholders. 3. Retain the earnings.

Buffett is talking about allocating the retained earnings back into the company in such way that it has a multiplier effect on A Corporation's market capitalization. If A Corp decides to retain $100 million USD in earnings, Buffett wants this amount of money to be reflected in the company's market cap. He would want to make sure the market cap of A Corp increases by at least $100 million dollars. Buffett is alluding to efficient allocation of capital translating to the company's market capitalization."

"Wouldn't it be cheaper/more efficient to pay people, rather than bail out companies?","&gt;If businesses are failing because no one is using them (e.g. air travel), then they are going to continue to need bailouts. Thinking bailouts are a one-time thing vs. ongoing UBI-type payments is unrealistic.

That depends on *why* they are failing. If airlines are failing because nobody is traveling due to the Corona virus, that's obviously something that only lasts as long as the virus does.

&gt;We've already seen companies using the cash to buy back stock.  OK, we can put in legislation to stop that, but paying people would be far more efficient.

They do? I don't think any bailouts have happened yet, so I find that unlikely.

&gt;Giving working people money maintains money flow - working people buy necessities, rather than investments.

Companies spending money isn't necessarily any different as far as money velocity is concerned than people spending money. Companies usually take up loans because they need money to spend.

&gt;Medium/long-term, we would realise either a) we don't need this/that industry or b) this industry needs to be more efficient.  It would provide a huge opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship as people try to fill the vacuum left by collapsed companies.

Exogenous shocks don't tell us anything about how ""necessary"" or efficient an industry is. Think about it, let's say a store gets robbed, all the inventory stolen and they go bankrupt. Does that tell us anything about how successful that store was? Nope.

Same thing with the Corona virus. If for example nightclubs go bankrupt because nobody goes to nightclubs because gatherings of more than two people are prohibited, does that mean these nightclubs weren't fun, or badly run, or that people weren't interested in going to them? No, they don't go for a reason completely unrelated to the nightclubs themselves.

&gt;What I'm reading is that we need to bail out companies in order to maintain jobs. Wouldn't it be far more efficient just to pay a UBI-type thing? (Note: I'm not advocating UBI *per se*, rather as a stop-gap in the current crisis.)

These are two separate issues, really. Workers have to make it, be able to pay for food, rent, etc. Especially for the industries that are basically shut down entirely. But abandoning business entirely isn't a good idea, either. You have two choices, support them and they at best can just continue business as usual after the crisis, which also means employees can get right back to work, or you don't help them and they go into bankruptcy and have to rebuild afterwards, which takes longer and really doesn't have much of a benefit aside from lower upfront cost. It would mean prolonging the crisis even more though."
Are we facing another financial crash?,"Predicting the future is difficult. And anyone able to do so with accuracy probably isn't answering questions about it here. If it were certain there would be a crash, prices would already be dropping.  Enough people think there's not a high chance of a crash in the near future that asset prices remain high.  So the consensus answer from the market is certainly ""no"". But, the market has been wrong before.

Some people think there's a chance of an upcoming crash, but there's *always some* people saying that*.

Most of economics isn't about predicting the market, but about explaining its mechanics.  The mechanics of what could cause a crash remain the same, it's driven by people's expectations.  A crash happens when enough people think one is eminent... But that's kind of a non-answer.

You specifically cite Fed policy, the danger there is Fed policy is not the sole driver of financial market performance.  We've had low rates preceding crashes and preceding periods of growth. You need to look at more than just that variable by itself.

Since you state you don't know much and want to learn, I suggest diving in to some reading. Here's the finance (immediately followed by macroeconomics) section of the FAQ reading list: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/reading#wiki_finance

There's also several online courses and youtube series covering some of the basics.  Another good way to start getting immersed is any number of media or print subscriptions. Wall Street Journal or The Economist are some widely circulated ones to start with. There's also likely a business &amp; finance section to your local paper.  Start reading and look things up as they've referenced!

Open a roth and focus it on growth. Better yet do a target date fund for year you turn 65. Invest as much as you can up to 6000 a year.

Anything. Even if 500 bucks a year for awhile.

you WILL be a millionaire when you retire.

If you have to pick stocks for the roth do this

50% VTI 30% SCHD 20% VXUS

You can do more VTI and less SCHD if you want.

They key is 50% or more VTI and VXUS. Mass growth and vxus is international exposure.


Then after a roth you can invest in what you want.

Why don't we tax patents like we tax property? Couldn't doing so help prevent patent trolling?,"Such a process is already in place: Renewal fees. To keep a patent in active, its owner must pay a fee to the patent office. In the US the USPTO charges at the 3.5,7.5 and 11.5 year mark with increasing costs for each renewal. see : https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule.
In Europe, the EPO has a similar structure with yearly payment that also increase. see : https://my.epoline.org/epoline-portal/classic/epoline.Scheduleoffees
Overall these extension fees are in the ~20.000 Dollar/euro range in order to renew a patent till its maximum limit.

Due to these high fees, it is more common for patents to lapse before 20 years than it is for them to make it. In economic research this is actually used to understand the value of a patent; when an owner bothers to renew their patent they apparently are willing to spend real money and therefore must think it valuable."

So what you do, use it like a firewall account.  Only fund this account with enough to cover your gym membership or any other autodraft services you may be using.

"Since when did a all equity etf/blue chip portfolio become a ""boomer"" portfolio?","I've come to terms with the fact that the demographics of this sub have fundamentally shifted. Where it used to be wealthy/middle-income retail investors ($25k-$200k invested), most of whom had full-time jobs and invested passively, it is now primarily lower-income ($500-$10k invested) without full-time jobs who are able to monitor hourly fluctuations, and who are drawn to inherently risky plays. So, while people are cautious in putting $15,000 into CNR, low-income investors won't think twice about putting $50 on MN. 

This is why it's especially important to heed advice on this sub extremely carefully: the line between penny stock investing and the mainstream has been blurred, to where blue chips/ETFs are now the exception on this sub, not the norm, even though the money does not reflect this. Ten people touting a stock may only have $500 combined invested, where larger investors have positions of hundreds of thousands. Remember that the money is still in traditional channels. 

I had this realization when discussing SCR. My initial position was around $9,000, and I would be taking with people on this sub who had $50 in it. And, hey, there is nothing wrong with that; kudos for wanting to build wealth! It's just important to remember that what is mainstream here is not reflective of the market as a whole."
So banks no longer have a 10% reserve requirement?? How can this possibly be 'ok' or work?,"The reserve requirement is the percentage of total deposits that must be held as reserves. From your example it would be that bank with $50 in total deposits could lend all its deposits with a 0% reserve requirement. Before, with a 10% reserve requirement that bank could only make $45 in loans from those deposits.
As for bank safety/financial stability here’s a link to the chart of excess reserves before and after the financial crisis:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS

Banks hold much more reserves now as well as being far less levered, both of which increases their ability to weather a liquidity crisis in which other potential bank assets may decrease in value.

Remember the equation for a bank is:

Assets = Liabilities + Bank Capital

A bank can not lend money it does not have in the form of its own capital or liabilities (deposits)

Why do Economists Disagree?,"Your question is not at all stupid. It is actually a pretty important one. It is based on a **very common** ~~misunderstanding~~ misconception on the role of mathematics in science.

&gt; If Economists are thus using maths to come to their conclusions, why is it then that they come do different conclusions?

That fact that a conclusion follows in a mathematically correct way from the hypothesis does not mean that the hypothesis was correct to begin with.

The same problem applies to physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and so on. The problem with economics is not the mathematics, but that it is complex, expensive, time-consuming (if not even impossible in practice, in some cases) to carry out the experiments to verify the hypothesis.

Compare string theory. It is mathematically perfectly fine, but physicists [vehemently disagree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Criticism) on whether it is a correct theory of the actual world we live in, or not at all.

&gt;  Are they not all using identical models that they were taught as a student?

No! This is the point. Different models start from different sets of assumptions, and so they come to different conclusions. In science, you run experiments to see which conclusions are correct in which cases, and from that, you can verify whether the assumptions were correct. (Unless you are lucky enough that the assumption itself can be verified directly!)"

The U.S. remains a superpower but it's no longer the only one like it's been since 1991."

Is it economically wise for developed countries to adopt an international digital currency?,"Let's break this into two parts: should we have a global currency (even among developed countries)? And should that currency be a digital currency?

There are a [few conditions a place must meet](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/ocaej.pdf) to form a ""Optimal Currency Area"" (meaning that area should share a currency): labor mobility, capital mobility, similar business cycles, and a risk-sharing fiscal mechanism. The world has many legal (immigration laws) and cultural (like language barriers) restrictions on labor movement, so labor is not very mobile. Capital is much more mobile than labor, but some restrictions are still in place. Business cycles are not aligned, a recession can easily take place in Singapore but not in America. Lastly, the world has little to no fiscal risk-sharing. If Australia undergoes a recession, the US isn't going to deficit spend to help them. So basically no, it doesn't make sense for the world or just developed countries to share a common currency.

Depending on what you mean by ""digital currency"", the money we have now is already largely digital. Now if you mean a Bitcoin-style cryptocurrency, well then that is a much worse idea. The central bank wouldn't be able to adjust the money supply to keep inflation stable and unemployment as low as possible, which is a major drawback."
Why don't all developers and real estate agents flip or invest themselves?,"OP, no worries. That's a valid question. Some of the points made so far make perfect sense. If an agent is at the top of his/her game, making more money in selling good homes, then there is no reason to take on the risks of flipping a home -- high cost, time dedication, and potentially long conversion times from fix to sale.

Some of these comments are just being plain rude. How does being a barber have anything to do with massages? Nothing stops someone from extended his/her talents to other related fields. A home builder, with all the knowledge in construction and the like, could use his/her own skills to reinforce (if possible) an old or abandoned home. Then flip it for a profit.

Can we all just agree that these people in home construction and realty do not flip homes for one of three reasons?

1. They don't have the money.
2. They are just not interested.
3. The reward does not outweigh the risk for whatever reason."
[US] Paypal account balance is -$2000. What can they do?,"PayPal is vastly more seller friendly than eBay and does NOT automatically side with the buyer in a dispute situation.   In over fifteen years of selling on eBay I have never, ever lost a PayPal case and I have no idea why previous posters are so firmly convinced you are absolutely screwed with no recourse.

Go to your PayPal account, click on the help link and call them.

Explain to the rep that the buyer will not provide photos of damage or cooperate with an insurance claim.  I’m not sure if PayPal can still access ebay messages but you can always upload screenshots to them if you need to.  The rep will go through your options with you but they are almost never going to just say too bad, you’re out of your item and your money.

How to use the perfect Fundamental and Technical Analysis combination to buy the right stock,"“As brought up in point 2, you cannot conduct an apple-to-apple comparison of a company’s performance in different sectors against each other. For example, you cannot compare Google’s P/E ratio (32.43) directly to Tesla’s P/E ratio (624.12). This would make it seem like Tesla’s stock is grossly overvalued. Only when you compare Tesla with a direct competitor like Toyota (11.30) then would you know that Tesla is overvalued, and Toyota undervalued.”

Does giving beggers/homeless money increase begging/homelessness?,"I found this recent paper looking at panhandlers in Manhattan [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300755](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119018300755)

Their results confirm my prior beliefs: panhandling is very inelastic. People don't *choose* to beg for money because it is lucrative. People *have* to beg for money because they don't have any better outside options. And if they get a little more or a little less money from begging, that won't change what they do. 

If you really want to keep kids in school and off the street, there is plenty of evidence that conditional-cash transfer programs are an effective tool.

Pershing Square Sells All of Their Netflix Stock,"Great thing about rationalization and intellectualization is they are two of the more common and mature defense mechanisms.  They allow one to justify any stance they want to have when it comes to investing.  If you want to get out of an investment you can think of a logical reason to do so.  If you want to stay in an investment you can think of a logical reason to do so.  If you want to get in of an investment you can think of a logical reason to do so.

If he his right now when he sold out or right when he bought in just less then 3 or so months ago is to be determined.  Worst part is he may be right or wrong for all the wrong reasons he used to justify his decisions.  That is what makes investing so difficult when it comes to single company stock investing.  You have no clue if you are right or wrong until after the fact (ex post) and even if you are right it might be different then the reasons you thought (thus less predictable then next time you try using the same line of thinking)."

Should I retire at 30 with $5M (today) or at 40 with $10M (in 10 years)?,"You don’t need a job to reach $10M based on your plan 

1. Balance your portfolio to something that will mirror the overall market gains. You don’t want much cash or even bonds IMO but you also don’t want all Teslas and Bitcoin. At your age, go a little risky but very diversified.
2. If you do that then yes it should double in accordance with “rule of 72” you should be good to double in 7.2 years but...
3. You can afford to skim off some each year to live on. It will roughly delay your doubling to 10 years... just like you discussed 

Based on that - your annual salary is no longer important. Quit that job asap

You may consider a different job, a different career, building a family, teaching, basically anything. But the one thing I would not do with your assets is work a job you hate."
Whos lending to governments?,"A good chunk of US government debt is intra-government: One agency borrowed money from another agency. In 2017 that was apparently [$5.5 of the $20 trillion debt](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-gross-debt-versus-debt-held-public#).

But most of the debt, including that held by foreign governments, is in treasury bonds and notes. Those are held by *everybody* since they're the standard ""safe"" investment. Banks hold them to meet capital requirements, institutional investors and hedge funds hold them as part of their portfolio, individual investors do as well. They're ubiquitous, they are the tool the Fed uses to control interest rates and when we talk about rates, we're talking about the rate of return on different treasury notes like the ""10 year T Note"" or the 1 month or 3 month rate."
What was your life like when you were 30?,"I had like $400, lived paycheck to paycheck. Got dumped because I had no ambition or potential. Bounced from banking into HR but I legit had no idea what I was going to do with myself. At 32 I started a company. I retire next month (less than 8 years later). So weird."
"India has been doing direct fiscal transfer for almost a decade now, it is called MGNREGA","I think the way you framed all of it is bound to create confusion. India has a lot of schemes that work towards providing social security/social welfare as part of the Directive Principles of State policy. 

Over the past years governement is trying move to the system of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mechanism through synergy of Aadhar+Jan Dhan Bank Accounts+Mobile Numbers (JAM Trinity).

Coming to the question of whether these transfers are freebies or not: payments under MNREGA are against jobs guaranteed by the government. There are also reinforcements of MNREGA with other schemes (Toilet construction under Swachh Bharat Mission, for example). Again overall implementation could be debated with ground realities, but at least MNREGA was not designed for doling out 'freebies'. And if you still hold that view, in many places it's given the benchmark of 'basic income' which rural masses have come to demand. In short: their bargaining power has increased. 

Even subsidies are not exactly freebies. You have to buy the product/service to actually avail the discount. (Can you call spring sales at stores in malls freebies, because, hey, they offer 30% off?). 

The closest, in my opinion, which comes to a 'freebie' is the basic income transfer. Many states have come out with schemes that pledge transfer of some regular stream of income if you satisfy certain criteria (Rythu Bandhu/PM Kisan). But again, pros and cons of it are still being debated with empirical data and behavioural changes observed during experiments. And again, this is to cover the 'basic needs' of the targeted population.

Also, found this on welfare measures vs freebies: [click here](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/what-distinguishes-welfare-measures-from-freebies/article30873368.ece)

TL;DR: MNREGA is not a freebie. Subsidies are not freebies."
PSA: Enjoy the fruits of your labor,"His early death definitely made me realize that I need to enjoy my money earlier (before retiring) rather than just saving it all up.

I've decided that I'm going to spend more to get a nicer apartment and some other things, a few thousand dollars a year is not going to make a big difference in the grand scheme of things."
Can someone with not much money get wealthy from trading?,"I started with 4 figures and turned it into 7 figures.  Trading has been my primary source of income for 20+ years. I'm no genius, but that doesnt mean you don't need smarts to trade, because you do. A little  luck (or a lotto luck) also helps.   


Keep in mind that if it was easy we'd all be doing it and making a living at it --- but it just isn't easy.  I lost a LOT of money starting out."
Unions and shareholders,"&gt;What prevents unions (or other groups of employees) from pooling resources in order to buy enough stock to make board members vote to increase wages and other labor requests?

You woukd need to own a lot of of the voting shares which could involve needing to purchase a huge proportion of the company.

If you're unionising for better pay you probably don't have those kinds of resources."
"as a value investor, I'm having a hard time justifying buying index funds in this overvalued market","I have a hard time finding anything decent to buy so I put it to ETFs, once the big crash comes I hope it will just take of the gains and wont go to minus then it's like have sit on cash. 
My biggest fear is that the market is strange as fuck and the crash can be years away so I could be up by 30% by then and crash will take off 25%, you know time in the market vs timing the market mantra."
[ETH Daily Discussion] - 23/May/2017,"This is how breakouts work guys:

1. Movement upwards

2. Breaks new ground and hits all time highs. People early on catch wind of this and jump aboard to ride the wave.

3. Price continues to rise with no end in sight. Now the people who missed the first wave jump on.

4. Peaks. This is where ETH was Sunday. There were still people jumping on board.

This is always, always, always followed by a correction.

1. Price retreats back down. The people who got in at or near the peaks are lose out. The guys who bought near the bottom of the wave and held, saw their gains disappear but at least they didn't lose too much money.

2. ETH falls back to establish a new normal price, higher than the old range when it started but lower than the peaks. 

Now if you were one of those lucky people who got in at $5 way back when and held all the way through, increasing positions over the course of time, congrats. IT IS STILL TERRIBLE ADVICE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE IF YOU TELL THEM TO BUY NOW WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONTEXT THE PRICE.

ETH doubled in price in 4 days. Yesterday was the 4th day of that rally, that's not sustainable rate of growth. The guys who got in yesterday missed out on ~$20/ether of value because they refused to recognize that an asset that doubles in less than a week is gonna retreat a bit. It's gonna happen to ZCash as well. Does anyone honestly think that now is the time to buy ZCash after it went up 125% in price? 

You want to avoid buying at peaks because you acquire less assets like that. If you're in this for the long haul, you want to buy as much ETH as possible and that doesn't happen if you by on the 4th day of 4 consecutive days of 20%+ gains. I started buying ETH at around $20-30 back in March and my busiest days were when the price was falling, I didn't always get in at the bottom but at least I always made sure it wasn't near the top. If I had just bought only when everyone was buying, maybe I have 15-20 less ETH now. That's a significant portion of the portfolio lost to irrational exuberance. 

We're not even talking about trading here. You don't have to be a genius trader to realize that 100% gains in a week is not the normal rate of growth for this asset. Let it establish a new normal before rushing in. Today, is the day ETH establishes that new normal, today is a good entry point. Yesterday? Not so much.

Yeah sure, you saved ""only"" 10%. Guess what? 10% of $3000 is 300, that's about about .4 additional ether at $150, than at $180. That is going to add up if this asset hits $200, $300, $1000 - whatever, levels. "
[ETH Daily Discussion] - 23/May/2017,"I'll be honest.  I was a bit worried about a bubble (yeah sorry for using that word around here), and still am a little bit.  But, I caught an article on Yahoo earlier that said if you bought $100 in Bitcoin in 2010 you'd have 70 million or so now.  While that's impressive, that's not really what caught my eye in the article.  I decided to read the comments, and it's actually insane how every other comment was basically saying:  ""Bitcoin's the biggest Ponzi in history,"" ""70 million of fake money that's not backed by anything,"" ""Yeah, but you can never cash out!""

The comments reaffirmed my contention that 99% of the population still doesn't understand the tech, but it's definitely undeniable that more capital is flying into crypto overall.

Just thought I'd share."

"GOODBYE, MORTGAGE!!!! It's my very own Homestead release!","Love this post! Congrats man! That's freedom! I think it was a smart move even if ETH hits $500 or more. You just changed your life and there's nothing wrong with taking the sure money to do that. I was in BTC early and when I realized I had enough to wipe out all the debt my wife &amp; I had (school loans, credit cards, etc.) I wiped it out. It's gone up a ton since then but I still love the move I made. We're much more relaxed not having that hanging over us and I'm still investing here and there. "

Habits that helped you FatFIRE,"Not a habit per se, but becoming more assertive has definitely helped me on my path towards fatness/fatFIRE. That belief that what you want sometimes matters more than some other person’s desires, the willingness to fight for stuff you don’t want to compromise on, that you have a lot of value to offer and can persuade people as such, and that you’re interesting and people are interested in what you have to say. Basically just growing a pair and getting stuck in, and giving less of a fuck what people think about you.  
  
It’s something I struggled with in my early-mid 20s, until I decided to stop caring so much what people thought of me. Paradoxically, it’s made people like me a lot more."

Tips I’ve made for myself as a new trader.,"You forgot rule #420.69 - Avoid hype and rockets


If there's rockets and people are telling you to buy whatever stocks, AVOID. Because if you're hearing it now from the masses, then you're most likely too late to the party.

"Are we open to having a healthy discussion? If the DD is solid and there is no convincing counter-DD, why don't we see more big whales buying large quantities on the open market or registering their shares? Shouldn't this be obvious to not only us?","This is a fair question.

In my experience working in finance &amp; corporate The culture is more about things getting packaged &amp; sellable. 

Can I sell it to internal or external clients?

Internal clients -  C-Suite management/vp level. They aren’t looking for deep thought. They want a 1-3 minute pitch that sounds good/looks good. How much money will it make. How much time does it take? Then the big one, do they understand what is trying to be done. If not, doesn’t matter if you are curing cancer it will never get approved, your project is dead. 

External Clients - They want “deep” thought. Basically sell me a short story narrative that engages with the client &amp; reaffirms their beliefs. (The show House of Lies really gets to the heart of this.) just a hit of confirmation bias.

&gt; Bill Gates is now the largest owner of farm land 

True, but so why is that alarming? Sustainable agriculture is a key focus of the Bill and Melinda gates foundation and Bill has been buying up land for decades. It's not all a recent purchase in response to some doomsday economic scenario. Steward Resnick owns almost as much land as Bill does. Is that also a problem?

&gt; Warren Buffet who has traditionally avoided gold and silver just bought over 500 million dollars in gold.

Buffet doesn't actively manage his fund anymore. Birkshire also bought a bunch of Snowflake Inc. stock pre-IPO. Buffet has said in the past that he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand and I can't really see him doing a deep dive into a cloud data analytics company and coming to the conclusion that it's a good purchase. I'm sure it was someone else working for him that dug into it and convinced him to buy it.

Also, Birkshire Hathaway controls a portfolio worth something like 400 billion dollars. 500 million is only 0.1% or so of that. It's the equivalent of me telling you I have $40,000 to invest and that I think I'm going to put $50 of it into gold. It's a negligible amount relatively speaking. The Gold chart (XAUUSD) also might be a monthly bull flag from just a technical analysis perspective.

&gt;  Elon musk invested heavily in Bitcoin which goes up when the market goes down.

Elon didn't, Tesla did and they are looking to allow for the purchase of their cars via crypto currency. I think it was in part so they could handle those transactions. Also, while I'm sure Elon signed off on it and maybe even proposed the idea he's known for some pretty wild/high risk investments so it's really not all that surprising. I imagine TSLA's lawyers set it up so that if the price tanks they can write off the losses on their taxes.

Also, I don't know why you think Bitcoin goes up when the market goes down. It literally just did the opposite of that. BTC dropped over 65% when the market tanked in Feb and Mar of 2020 due to corona. BTC, SPY, and QQQ all peaked and and bottomed almost to the day in 2020. Crypto then rallied all of 2020... but so did the entire market. Both are at all time highs right now. You could say they are correlated but not inversely so.

&gt;  Even at 5 year lows hedge funds are shorting stocks.

Purposefully shorting companies into the ground is part of the business model of a lot of hedge funds. They've been doing it for decades, it's not something new related to the current economy. [There is an old Jim Cramer video from 2006 discussing this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityLinksMirror/comments/l92mtj/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/) 

&gt; The money supply is going crazy. Inflation seems to be massive in some sectors and non exsistant in others. But it's mostly in open parts of the economy the inflation is happening. More money chasing less goods. 

Any examples?

&gt; The market is still volatile and personally I don't think we've seen the worst of the lows yet. I think once the pandemic is over and the money printing slows (2 years is my guess) we'll see massive spikes in the cost of goods that will rock the middel class to the point where they are subsistence living on 60k. 

Inflation, at least as tracked by the Fed is still below 2% and a large amount of the money that has been printed is getting exported. The dollar (DXY) is certainly weak, but it's also where it was in 2018 so it's not in territory completely unheard of.

&gt; $15 minimum wage will be worth less or the same as the current $7.25. This means almost no money spent on luxuries and companies failing. They can't just double everyone's salary while also loosing a giant portion of sales.

Counter Point - Australia and several European countries have exchange rate adjusted minimum wages at or above $15 per hour and seem to be doing alright. The minimum wage would be [around $12 had it kept with inflation](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-higher-the-federal-minimum-wage-should-be-2017-12) and [$24 had it kept up with productivity.](https://cepr.net/this-is-what-minimum-wage-would-be-if-it-kept-pace-with-productivity/) $15 may be a bit too high in some low cost of living some areas of the country and too low in some high cost of living areas but it's not [anything outlandish.](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/#:~:text=Since%201979%2C%20pay%20and%20productivity,(after%20adjusting%20for%20inflation) It's also a steady increase to $15 over the next 4 years (2025) not all at once. Businesses will have time to adapt.

If you're rolling options you are taking a loss. Plain and simple.,"What you're pointing out is common knowledge to those who know what they're doing. Nobody has ever argued that rolling is creating a ""profit"", just a cash credit.

Everybody knows that there's a book loss upon closing a losing short option--that's because it's two transactions.

But the point is that you're keeping the same liability (the now rolled-out call) and the same asset (shares), but with a higher cash balance (composed of extrinsic value). It doesn't matter whether you were up or down on your short play, because now you simply have *more*, which by definition is a ""gain"".

In a way, by rolling out you're selling time, which regardless of the underlying's movement is a gain after the passage of time. It just takes that time for the extrinsic value (in the form of cash at the time of rolling) to become gains (in the form of a decreased liability)."

Received High Value information - Income Tax e-campaign - Fret not,"&gt;	We've been saying this for years now - Systems are getting stronger. Gone are the days when you could misreport income. The Income Tax Department has tons of information now. 

Meh, IT department only harasses salaried class and it frustrates me.

A guy I know runs a travel business and his income (not business revenue) alone crosses 20 lakhs per year but he has never paid a single rupee of income tax ever. He reports 1.2 lakhs per year (10 k/mo) as income like clockwork every year for the past 10 years. 

Sure, he can show business losses etc. but how can one declare 10k/mo as income for 10 years straight under declaring by 20x and never get caught? I mean he pays himself 1.5 lakhs/mo as salary which is literally shown in his business books but IT department has never made that connection why his ITR says 10k/mo. But they harass people for not declaring savings account interests."

"Why is the Canadian economy such a basket case, when compared to America, or Asia?","Market cap is a seriously terrible metric to look at here. That measures the 'size' of a single corporate entity, not an industry. Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. 

\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. 

\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. 

\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. 

&amp;#x200B;

Canadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them."
"I'd hate to say this but we SHOULD NOT start with this ""They lost"" sentiment. Are we on the moon yet? No. Did you get tendies or bananas? No. Don't start celebrating which will cause you to lose focus. Keep your head focused and STAY THE COURSE.","Yep. I'd like to think the majority of us understand this. 

The amount of money we stand to gain is life changing. I would think most of us are in the type of lives where we actually have to have, or own, that thing before it feels real. Either because we don't have that much to begin with, or we've been cheated and lied to so often we have to physically be holding the thing before it feels real. 

I want to celebrate some, but that's overshadowed by the feeling that this isn't over, I still don't have a phone number in my bank account, and even though it may look like apes will get some tendies this time, there's been too many other times where shit went terrible. 

So I won't be celebrating until we hit $100MM and I've sold on the way down and need to open new bank accounts to store all the gains. And even then, you won't see me celebrating, because I don't want to live as a lawsuit target and get my tendies taken away."
Where is the edge in selling premium? What most newcomers miss that is extremely important.,"I agree 99%. The only thing I’ll add is if you YOLO your full roll buying an option and lose, you don’t get 9 more tries. The central limit theorem only works if you live long enough to make lots of trades."
At what point does your money start to make serious gains on its own?,0 to 100K is the hardest. 100k to 1M is easy. 1M to 5M is easier. 5M to 10M is easiest.

UNPOPULAR OPINION - we should stop telling young people to choose jobs they love and tell them to choose jobs that will allow them to love their life.,"I think it’s important to do something you find interesting, but it doesn’t have to be an ultimate passion.

For example, if you like maths, doing an engineering degree might have better employment options than doing a maths degree, but you can still work in something that is relevant to your interest."

"India has been doing direct fiscal transfer for almost a decade now, it is called MGNREGA","&gt;it is made to look as though its a job under MGNREGA

There was a very interesting thought process behind making NREGA seem like a job.

It ensured that the beneficiaries are self-selected. Nobody who does not actually need it is going to work under the hot Indian sun in manual labour for a few hundred rupees. The cap of a hundred days also ensured that seasonally unemployed labour had an extra income source during the off season. In fact, that is why so much of NREGA work is irrigation related.

You can argue that the program had some holes with fake names and authorities siphoning away money, but in my opinion, NREGA is pretty much the best designed social welfare program in India. A lot of talent went into its design."

If you use an investment advisor make sure they are truly a real fiduciary. A lot of people out there pretend to be but are conflicted and try to talk to you into investments they have profits on.

I would just go get an account at Schwab and invest it in broad diversified. Read Bogleheads. Hire an estate trust attorney.  None of these fools can beat the market, why should you try?

I watched a YouTube video, don't have the link, in which Warren Buffet talks about the great depression. Those who sold during the depression, which is warranted given that it was the depression, lost almost everything. Those who held for 10-20 years not doing anything made a huge profit. I can't say that this is the same thing, but so far the investment strategy of not doing anything at all has worked for me.

*I should also mention that I did a lot of research on the projects that I held. I recognized their potential in the long term, and they are all projects that have continued to develop and achieve their long term goals. I made mistakes early on and got hit by exchange transfer fees, gas fees, and icos. Lost some money in the process. This is another reason I decided to just not do anything.

Friendly reminder. Live your life to the fullest while you can.,"I'm sorry for your loss. =( Hang in there, OP.

I learned from him that I should plan for tomorrow but still enjoy today. When I get a windfall (such as a stock vesting event or a bonus), I set aside at least 10% of it for something fun. I've done this consistently since he died, and I've never regretted it."

By the end of the retreat you will be able to visit any beach, any where, and determine within 30 seconds whether the tide is going in or going out. Obviously this applies to trading.

At night we have a campfire and look at the stars.

I live in an underdeveloped country where when talking about government intervention and welfare this phrase is common: “you want the welfare of Norway/Sweden/Denmark without wanting to make what they made before [economic freedom to get rich]”. How right/wrong is this assertion?,"It is the case that the Scandinavian welfare states appeared after they had started on widespread economic growth, with Finland slower to grow and also later to start its welfare state than the other Scandinavian countries, only introducing a public healthcare system in 1970. 

Also, a country's ability to have a welfare state of a given size is in the long run constrained by the need to pay for it. Even running the edges of fiscal sustainability can cause economic problems, e.g. if governments resort to inflation to try to cover fiscal deficits.

However, there's a lot of variation in what is meant by ""welfare state"", for example England &amp; Wales and Scotland had their own systems of poor laws from the 17th century (loose dates because there's a difference between a law being passed and a law being enforced), and arguably they provided some of the social background for the Industrial Revolution. (Said spending however was very small scale by today's standards, estimated to have peaked at 3% of GDP). Therefore the context in which these statements are being made in Brazil matters, a thing I am fairly confident you know more about than me.

"Introducing stonkr: an open-access, open-source R package for stock price prediction using feed forward neural nets.","If I'm not mistaken, it seems you've trained the neural net on daily closing price data. There are two major fundamental issues with this which are why deep learning isn't effective on pure price data

1. Price data is a non-stationary variable. That is, it does not deviate around a stable mean. Price values change over time and have trends, which breaks their ability to be used for time-series forecasting as neural nets rely on stationary data. To get around this, you need to use returns or log-returns. Furthermore, even these variables are pretty noisy and in most cases the NN will just use yesterdays return to predict tomorrow as that's the best it can do.

2. Dataset size. This is just a rule of thumb, but generally NNs need over 10,000 data points at least to be effective. They heavily depend on large sample sizes, so using only a few hundred points/days worth of data isn't going to be sufficient.

NNs on OHLCV data have been done to death by data scientists or programmers or engineers trying to make a break in finance, but they always yield shit results. More traditional statistical approaches seem to be the way to go, that or you need some form of data which provides much better signals than standard pricing information"

If corporate profits are at a all time high. Than why is the stock market plunging?,"Interest rates alone are enough to crash the theoretical valuation of any stock nearly regardless of all but the most hyperaggressive profit growth. The mathematical equation for stock valuation in perpetuity (Discounted Cash Flow) can be basically super simplified into:

Cash Profits ÷ (Risk Free Interest Rate + Risk Premium - Growth)

Assuming a risk premium of 7% and growth of 2%, then interest rates moving from 0% to 5% means mathematically the value of your stock is now half. To offset that change in interest rate would require you to grow at an extra 5% every year forever (basically 350% of your current growth).

In fact, a major reason why companies are choosing to boost profits now is that the higher interest rate discounts later profits more than earlier ones. This means cash you generate in future is worth a lot less than cash you generate now. Companies are hence incentivised to forego growth in return for upfront profits."
"Why aren't individual taxed only on ""profits"" like corporations are?","Taxing people on their discretionary income would probably allow for a lot of very easy fraud. Corporations face fairly struct regulatory oversight regarding their accounting standards, so the only way to make taxes on individual discretionary income work would be to establish similar rules for individuals, which would be much much more complex than the current system where you're taxed on your whole income and there are credits/deductions for people given certain circumstances."

ELI5 what's the deal with 30 to 45 DTE?,"Oh boy… there is a lot going on that needs clarity. First off, lets tackle OP’s questions. 

**Why sell 45-60 DTE Options** - When trading options, there are two things that you need to consider. 1) Time and 2) Price of underlying. As time passes, the premium goes down until the option expires. However, as price of the underlying moves, the premium changes as well. The best indicators for these are theta and gamma. 

*Theta*: Everyone here is familiar with. It’s literally in the name. Tracks how the premium changes with time. 

*Gamma* - Much less understood on this sub. By definition, gamma tracks the movement of delta. But what does it *really* mean? It essentially tracks how much you get screwed over if the underlying swings in the wrong direction. 

Theta and Gamma are not linear. When an option is born as a LEAP, changes in Theta and Gamma are fairly small. As the option gets closer and closer to expiration, Theta plays a bigger role in helping to decrease the premium. This is known as theta decay or theta burn. **Theta starts to burn the most between 45-60 DTE** 
As you start to get into 21 DTE and closer, gamma plays a much bigger role. A small swing in the underlying has a drastic effect when expiration is close by. Many investors will close their position by 21 DTE to minimize risk of losing previously made gains. 

**Closing at 50% gains** According to TastyWorks, closing at 50% gains provides the best P/L ratio over the long term. This is because anything past 50% introduces additional time where you’re exposed to risk for margin gains. Yes, it sucks to purposely let go of a position that appears to be doing well, but when you’re making hundreds of trades, gambling with risk exposure for diminishing returns is just about guaranteed to bit you enough times to not make it worth it. 

**Debunking longer DTE options provide less premium** The example you gave appears to be for a single option sale (such as CC and CSP). When you work spreads, typically, 45-60 DTE options will yield similar returns when compared on a week-to-week basis. Additionally, having more time to adjust for changes in the underlying means you win more. Even when receiving lower profit per trade, if 45-60 DTE trades win more, they can come out on top in the long run. 

**In conclusion** 45-60 DTE allows for an investor to capitalize on theta decay without having to worry as much about swings in the price of the underlying. Weekly options may provide better premiums on a per-trade basis, but are much more of a price shoot where you’re crossing your fingers that the underlying stays above/below a certain value.

What are the best anti-aging products/treatments money can buy?,"Definitely a prescription retinoid + daily, diligent sunscreen use. Topical skincare products with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, niacinamide, copper peptides, chemical exfoliants like AHAs/BHAs and maybe something nice and fermented like SK-II essence. Everyone’s skin reacts differently so it’s good to try a few different products to see what works best for you personally. Fractional laser resurfacing for face and neck. Regular preventative and then maintenance Botox. Microneedling treatments with PRP and/or radio frequency. Regular use of at-home micro current devices and LED mask (red light is great for anti-aging, blue light for reducing breakouts). Possibly some light filler if you start to lose volume in the lips/cheeks/nasolabial fold/under-eye area but everyone’s face is different so definitely get a professional’s opinion. Decades from now, instead of relying exclusively on filler and risking an over-filled appearance, maybe consider getting a deep plane facelift.

Edit: To clarify, this is more like a list of general options rather than a universal set regimen. A lot of this won’t be relevant for many until decades into the future, if ever. Just start with daily sunscreen and washing your face. Eventually consider connecting with a derm for a retinoid prescription. Everything else is a bonus."
How I turned $54k into $400K+ in 8 Months. Deal Analysis of my Mobile Home Park,"I’m really happy you brought up the wastewater treatment plant. This is something overlooked by most investors that gets them into trouble. 

I run a contract utilities business and I have a few investors that will have me look at the treatment plant and water supply. One of my investor clients just closed on a park and was able to get 100k off the first negotiated price because he brought me in to assess the infrastructure (the treatment plant was a complete mess and was under enforcement by the state). I’ve saved clients over the years well into seven figures on this tactic alone.

Most of the time these treatment plants are neglected and need lots of work and current owner is under enforcement from the state regulatory agency (that headache gets passed onto you when you buy it). It is literally a pro investor move that can save you 100’s of thousands if not millions of dollars over your REI career."
Why are American and Swiss wages so much higher than most countries,"I don't quite agree with /u/DishingOutTruth. I think it's worth going into things a bit further.

Firstly, I would appreciate a link to where the OP got their data from. Where does the number of $3K come from /u/Patch_Lucas771?

There are two rather different question here. Firstly, what causes the difference in income? Secondly, what causes the difference between GDP-per-capita and median income?

Starting with the second question. Inequality clearly make a difference because it affects the difference between mean income and median income. If we think about the difference between mean income and GDP-per-capita, there are still several factor causing differences between countries.

Taxes make quite a lot of difference here. Low corporation taxes encourage businesses to locate in a country. They also encourage businesses to locate their most profitable operations in that country, they encourage companies to import capital to that country. I live in Ireland myself and I know that well. In Ireland there's a large difference between GDP-per-capita and mean incomes because of large corporate profits. That said, I'm not sure if that applies so well to the Netherlands or Switzerland.

Another issue is the difference between income and wages. Are the numbers mentioned by Patch_Lucas771 actually wages or incomes? That's why I asked. It's important because in some places perks are more important. If they're not counted in wages then that can make a difference. In some countries there are large tax breaks for firms if they provide things like health insurance and pensions, even in some cases things like canteens and gym membership. Those things are large enough to make a difference. This can also happen through the government, more on that later.

Onto the first question, what causes the difference in income between different countries. This is one of the biggest questions in Economics. It's not at all simple.

DishingOutTruth wrote:

&gt; As for the rest of the European countries, their wages are lower on average because they work a lot less. The average northern/western European works about 400 hours less per year than the average American. This is partly because of generous benefits like paid leave, ranging from three weeks in Germany to up to FIVE weeks in Finland (holy shit lol). This isn't including the one year+ maternity and paternity leave, so they get a ton. Many Europeans also opt for thirty two hour work weeks to spread their vacation days around. The money to fund all these benefits has to come from somewhere, and this is usually in the form of lower wages and higher taxes.

Now, the last point here is certainly correct. The issue of tax-and-spend is somewhat similar to perks. If the government taxes someone then it reduces that person's net income. But, if that tax funds redistribution then it goes to someone else who gets to spend it. So, looking at wages net of tax can be deceptive. Again, this comes back to the source of the data that /u/Patch_Lucas771 used. Some are gross of tax and some net of tax.

Excepting that, is it true that holidays make all the difference. No, it's not. [This graph](https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm) of productivity per hour worked shows the issue. For many European countries, even if people did work as many hours as they do in the US their income would not be as high as the US. That's true without going in to the difference in the amount of capital being used."

Hard Lessons Learned,"I really don’t think you need to blow your first account, but it’s difficult because most folks want to risk too much too early. 

I risked $10 / trade for an entire year as I learned and found my edge. After great weeks I really wanted to increase my risk, but stuck to my plan. 

What newbies need to remember is risk small!! Very small!! And when your strategy starts working, don’t increase your risks until you duplicate your success month after month (3-4 months). What happens is when we start winning we double or triple down and the market shifts stages. So, our little wins get wiped out quickly with bigger losses. 

Start small and stay small until you are consistent for months. Then slowly ramp up risk and repeat success over another few months. You’ll eventually get to your acceptable risk (1-2%) and don’t need to blow up account.

Just my 2 cents..."

How do rich people “hoard wealth?”,"They don't hoard wealth. Usually I see this point being made with regards to wealthy inequality, but if you believe the Thomas Piketty argument about wealth inequality it turns out the opposite is true. Wealthy people have such a plethora of places to invest, and these places provide a higher return on investment than the average worker sees in wage increases. I'm oversimplifying Piketty's argument here, but one result is that it is precisely *because* wealthy people are investing their money that we are seeing an increase in wealth inequality during the last few decades."
This community/subreddit kind of sucks.,"Trading attracts a *certain* kind of crowd.

Of course, there are the sensible ones: either professionals who have been in this field for decades, have experienced and seen all sorts of possibilities and truly appreciate the complexity of the profession, or noobs who at least have the humility to accept that just because they succeeded in gambling here and there, doesn't make them a pro."

+Their stock is at a very attractive price right now considering their financial history

+They have grown every year of their existence so far

+Average revenue generated per user is up, so even if growth stalls they could still increase revenue

For now, embrace the demand, embrace market psychology based chart analysis like MACD and EMA and then ride it without thinking too much about it.

2008 Housing Crash - Why not pay the mortgages instead?,"I'm a bit late to the party, but wanted to contribute anyway;

First, let me self-reference [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/jgmg9n/when_financial_systems_fail_instead_of_bailing/g9rsn7d/) comment to a slightly similar question. Additional to the points about moral hazard, the main points are that a) mortgage debt is absolutly huge and making a dent in it is almost impossible, b) cancelling this debt disproportionally benefits a small part of society (especially in the case of 2008, as most mortage-owners in trouble re-financed their mortages and used the money on consumption), and c) the whole comparison is a non-sequitur because, first, most of the systemic boost came from the central bank, not the gvt (and the central bank deals with banks, not individuals) and, second, most of the bailout were in the form of loans or equity (so it would be more similar to the government buying your house including your mortage to cover the risk, but you still having to pay it). This also answers your point about ''moral hazard for giant banks'' - it is definitely there, but not as bad as cancelling debt.


That said, what I wanted to contribute is that if you are interested I'd really reccomend [this](https://www.amazon.com/Shaky-Ground-Strange-Mortgage-Giants/dp/0990976300/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=fannie+mae+mclean&amp;qid=1605603512&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1) book which I finished yesterday. It is in general super interesting, but also answers


&gt; Why couldn't the Obama administration do this?


This. There was namely a plan at the time to use the left-over TARP money to reduce principal costs to equal to asset value. In other words, if your mortgage was higher than the value of your house, the difference would be paid-off/cancelled (reducing the incentive to foreclose). This mainly didn't happen because it required approval of the Treasury, the [FHFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Housing_Finance_Agency), and the [OFHEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Federal_Housing_Enterprise_Oversight). The FHFA was led by DeMarco, a republican, and replacing him required congressional approval which was impossible at the time due to the toxic political situation. DeMarco didn't want to sign-off on this.


This is not to say that DeMarco didn't want to sign of because he wanted to block a democratic president. The treasury and FHFA both had run models predicting the effects, but assumed different levels of strategic default rates. Which is a highly technical and difficult discussion, and I am not in a position to judge which assumption was more fair."
Making a case for India Post banking services,"You are not comparing the right products. You opened an premium account with icici and you are comparing it with a basic post office account. If you want to compare the charges do it against SBI savings account. SBI provides all these facilities while being a full bank (and being the biggest bank in India means that it is 'too big to fail' and a implicit sovereign guarantee). 

I see from schedule of charges for IPPB that there are charges for IMPS/NEFT etc (which SBI provides for free) and AMC (which is almost same as SBI). Also from what I can see there are some limits in IPPB that your end of day balance can be only 2l, is this true? If yes, then it is a problem if you want to do a big ticket purchase (as any cheque payment will bounce). Also, sweep in/out has limited window and not available at night and weekends.

I am not sure how you save 14-15k. Can you provide the break down? 

Interest rate being 4% is good but the way it is calculated is outdated. They still calculate it based on the balance between 10-30th of the month(it is not customer friendly and RBI had asked banks to move away from this 4-5 years back). Also the interest is paid at the end of the year (whereas banks pay quaterly) thereby reducing the effective interest rate (in a normal bank account your interest for the first quarter would have compounded for 9 months). 

Also looking at the details of the linking between IPPB and POSA(sweep in/out) I think it is similar to a mod account in SBI (where amount above a threshold goes to an automatic fd which gets higher interest and when the main account balance is low these fds get broken in multiples of thousands automatically). SBI has this working seamlessly without user intervention. This allows one to get better than 4% returns (4.9%)


There is the con of going to the post office for a lot of things. Unless your job is flexible this is not everyone s cup of tea. From my limited experience (my dad has an account there) their servers are down more often than not.

Why not use a bank if you need banking?"

Tenant started a fire to deter eviction,"Been there.  Had a tenant that started a fire in her unit because I wouldn't replace her carpet. She, of course, was a moron and didn't realize that there was a sprinkler head in her closet where she tried to start it so relatively little damage to my unit (carpet in closet and bedroom and some drywall in the closet - oh and a fire test).  For her it ruined her clothes and her bedroom furniture. 

So, not only did she not get new carpet, she found out she was moving, ruined a bunch of her own stuff, and got IIRC a roughly $4k bill from me. 

Oh, for your morning humor her reason the fire started was - and I do not make this shit up - hot laundry out of the dryer that she had carried downstairs and into her unit.

Just proceed with the eviction. Not sure why she thinks a fire slows you down rather than - pardon the pun - accelerates you."

Telling the employer to give me a raise or say goodbye without destroying relationship,"My method is simple; Make sure the rubber meets the road. AKA make sure that I can bank on the value I perceive I have to employers.  

I do it by actively engaging with employers, making sure my CV is up to date, and interviewing at least once or twice a year for practice. Take the interview process to the point of getting an offer. Once you have an offer in hand then it is all business and no feelings. You're holding a valid offer from a competitor and you are going to be opening up the discussion with your current employer based on your career prospects and current opportunities not on what you perceive your value to be or what you want to earn. It will be all cold hard facts if your value really is what you think it is. And you'll be leaving it to your leadership as a business decision. 

You don't have to tell them you have an offer in hand. It will be fairly clear by your level of confidence in the discussion."

If you are serious about desiring $300k of annual income, then sell the company and ride out your days on whatever beach, mountain, or urban sidewalk you choose.  If you want $300k/yr and still have some skin in the game, then you should sell about $5MM of your company.

You mention things like real estate, but I'm curious about the why - you can have plenty of passive income if you wanted to, so does real estate investment excite you?  Does investing in general excite you?  Do you want to start another company?  What's next for you?"
The Trading Halt was a Removal of the Buy Button,"The good news is, because the borrow fee was so high, it literally cost them a fuckton of money, so as long as the borrow fee stays high, they can only do it so many times. 

The other good news is, the fact that they didn't literally just turn off the buy button like last time, that this is, so far, more cost effective that literally shutting off the buy button. Being brought up against Congress and into the light had much more effect than we probably know. Ie, it cost less to pay a ~~fine~~ fee than to be dragged out of the shadows and let people see you mumble, stutter, and refuse to maintain eye contact with a camera where all of your clients can see they may actually be fucked. Especially considering when your clients might not be on the right side of the law themselves

Edit: editing my comment to add some stuff that's been discussed many times in various comments on this thread. 

1.	Market makers don't pay for borrow fees

My guy, I may be smoothbrained but even I know this. But y'all are thinking too small. As a fellow gamer myself, I can appreciate that y'all want to kill the conjurer instead of wasting time on the conjured. However, this is irl (oddly enough, this simulation has been confirmed so many times that who knows, maybe we are in a video game).

I digress. My point is, you're thinking too small. Unlike the video games, going for the conjurer is hard. Instead of a shield, because this is a fantasy game, they got hundreds of minions; a minion meat shield if you will. These minions are the smaller SHF. The ones that don't get to sit at the big boy table. The ones that get the scraps of meat the conjurer boss throws them. They may not play the same rules we poors do, but because of their limited monies, they still have to play by some rules. 

Back to my boss analogy. Imagine, if you will, that these minions in the minion meat shield, owe a little bit of power to the conjurer. And every time a minion meat shield goes down, the boss gets a little weaker. As you, the intrepid heroes and heroines in this MMO, whittle down the minion meat shield by doing what you've been doing, namely buying and hodling, eventually, according to the Elder Scrolls of the DD, A Domino effect will send a cascading power event that will bring down the conjurer, the MMs. 

But guess what... As the dust settles, behind the conjurer boss you just killed, in the shadows, lurks the conjurers boss, the DTCC. 

YEAH, that's right, the MMs like Citadel aren't even the boss level boss, they were just the warm up. Wasn't even the final boss's first phase"

Is this video correct? Gravel Institute calls Uber a scam for workers,"Let me go over some of their arguments one by one. I think that some of their arguments do not hold at all, and some even are contradictory. I do think there are some legitimate criticisms to be had, and some of these are hinted at by the video.

* Profits - it is true that Uber is not making a profit, but this is countered to some extent by their 'monopoly argument'. In the short-run, a company doesn't have to make profits.

* Disruption/innovation - It is simply false that the business model of Uber does not innovate or disrupt. It allows for becoming a short-term, part-time, and temporary taxi-service. In a way, it allows for self-employed taxi-drivers without any overarching organization. It is clear that this is disruptive from the note that so many traditional taxi drivers seem to experience many negative consequences. Certain methods (e.g. surge pricing) may have the aim to more efficiently match price and demand.

* Flexability - It is false that there is no flexability. This is also illustrated by the fact that 90% of drivers quit after a year - it could actually illustrate that there are very low entry and exit barriers. Are you a student with nothing to do over summer and a nice car - you can earn some money. Are you severly in need of money - you can make long hours. This is also supported by their note that 'most rides are made by a small group'. Sure, but in a traditional taxi company, around equal rides are made by each taxi driver, thus, less flexability.

* Efficiency - It is then also false that they are not aiming for efficiency. Marketing and lobbying aren't counters to this, and I'm not even sure whether it holds when controlled for firm size. Uber needs a large national market share, and thus marketing, and Uber can be threatened by legislation, and thus needs lobbying. It is a completely different scenario from traditional firms and cannot be used as an argument for inefficient spending.

* Subsiditization and market share - It is true that Uber would make much more money mostly if it could outcompete other firms first. I wouldn't say that the explicit aim is to establish a full monopoly, but clearly, monopolistic behavior would be beneficial and this is partially the aim of their strategy. This can also be seen by investment strategies - some institutional investors invest in both Lyft and Uber, and the two in some regions seem to aim not to compete.

So no, it isn't a scam, but there are some legitimate criticism. Myself, I'd put those differently:

* The competition with traditional taxi firms, in a way, overcomes many inefficiencies. This, partially, is also their innovation (and a similar point can be made for airbnb). Getting a lift, or renting a room from a stranger can be dangerous and high-variance. It could be a terrible experience or a wonderful one. As such, many countries and regions have introduced legislation requiring firms and individuals to adhere to all sorts of rules. Hotels need to adhere to certain standards, and taxi drivers need permits, perform tests, and register their drives to make sure they take sufficient breaks. Platforms, such as Uber, overcome the original problem by providing a reputation system. This removes some of the inefficiencies, but, the outcompeted workers obviously have a very legitimate argument if they say that it is highly unfair that they had to jump through all sorts of hoops and are now outcompeted by (unverified) entrants.

* A big danger with platforms is that they have enormous scale benefits, which can be abused. We see this with firms like takeaway and amazon, and are likely to see it with a firm as Uber as well. As soon as, lets say, 80% of consumers order their food through takeaway, a restaurant can not afford to *not* be on takeaway. As a result, takeaway can increase their margins, reducing profits for the restaurants. This is even more evident with Amazon - as they do not only provide a platform but also sell themselves. As soon as a product is sufficiently profitable, they can use their data to target the right users and raise the fees for sellers to such a degree that they can't compete with Amazon. Since, however, all customers are now used to ordering on Amazon and the option is still there, there is no way to go for these firms. Monopolistic behavior thus, is a legitimate concern. While competing apps may occur if fees become sufficiently large, entry barriers will be large as a certain market share is key.

* The consequence of the other two points combined is that the wage of drivers needs to be a concern. Generally, for a decent profit, drivers need *both* volume and a certain price. If 80% of rides are performed on Uber, switching to a different app with a higher hourly wage (and lower fees) may simply not be sufficient for full-time drivers. As consumers are likely to switch (also to substitutes) if the price becomes too high, it is then simpler to increase fees and lower the fare for drivers. This isn't necessarily economically bad or inefficient. But, if a certain standard of living is prefered by society, and thus a minimum wage is set, the 'self-employed' drivers may not receive this minimum wage - which would be a classic example of monopsony power. A strong argument could then be made that these drivers should at least earn minimum wage as well."

Lest We Forget,"Winston Churchill said  ''*Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it*'' in a speech to the House of Commons in about 1947/48, reflecting on the horrors of WW2. 

It's paraphrased slightly from George Santayana, the original axiom being ''*Those who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat it*''.

Its quite a poignant statement when you think about it.

 There is an increasing amount of research though, being done on the brain and its capacity for memory and the utility of this function. Whereas initially it was looked at as a function of stored collective and individual data, we now know that we are hardwired to see the world as terrain to be mapped.

As we map out our lives, the memory serves to recall any pitfalls or dangers and how they were dealt with in the past. It's true across a number of levels, physical, emotional, psychological etc....

Its why you can ride a bike (presumably) after not getting on one for years, the brain has mapped this function, committed the dangers to memory, mapped out a sequence of movements that allow you to mitigate the risk level associated down to an acceptable level and therefore it doesn't need to send you any alert signals.

Which is quite a long way to go to make a short point, that its imperative to remember history, especially the terrible parts. Not to glorify them, but to make damn sure we don't do it again.

I remember a few years ago, reading a lot of stuff about how Anzac Day, Remembrance Day etc.. glorifies war and I thought ""No it doesn't. It honors the sacrifice on an individual level of those who chose to make it (and the individual level is the correct level of analysis) and it serves as a reminder never to do this again''.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 31/May/2017,"So, for the first time tonight, I think I've finally realized I shit luck stumbled upon the biggest goldmine of 2017, and quite possibly of the entire decade.

I got a crude reality check tonight as I browsed personal finance threads on Reddit just lurking around. I mean fuck, how they talk about money over there. How saving $250 extra a month over there is creaming pants, and how 30 years of doing it will get you X amount of $'s in the end, and were over here talking ""When's $300. We want $300.""

I think as time has gone by we've gone borderline delusional, we're fucking fiends, we're fucking criminals for talking about a 100% price rise in the next 7 months as a conservative estimate after what we've done this year already, are we fucking high? 

The scariest part is, I believe it is only the beginning. The space is only growing and ether is cheap relative to its intrinsic value. This year may be the year people look back on absolutely kicking themselves if they ever heard the word Ethereum or Bitcoin and didn't pay attention.

The truth is that neither of these options are great. But Option B is better. By a lot.

Yes, you may (will) have communication issues with Option B, but this is an addressable problem that may people are able to work through.

**Option A wants to run a business out of your residential property and do not have stable income.** They will be letting unknown dogs run around your property, and at the end of it you'll find yourself with a couple thousand dollars *tops* in security deposit funds trying to fix all of the damage. You'd likely be better off leaving the property vacant than letting them run a dog boarding business out of it.  


Edit: This is, by the way, not an ""ethical"" question at all."
"If you’re retired, how much do you have saved today?","I started contributing to a 401K in 1991 and retired in 2016. When a Roth401K option became available at my company in 2012 I started contributing to that as well.

I always contributed enough to get the company match.  That was 6% as the company would match 50cents on the dollar up to a maximum of 3% of my salary.  When I switched jobs in 1994, I upped the contribution to 10%. In 2008 when the market crashed, I upped it to 15%.  When the Roth option came available, I opted for a 5% contribution for that and continued with the 15% for the 401K.

I retired in 2016 with a small pension of about $900 a month (before taxes). I rolled over both accounts into an IRA and a Roth IRA.  I was 60 when I retired and I'm 66 now.  I will be getting my Social Security at 66 and 4 months and it should be about $2100 a month.  When I retired my 401k to IRA rollover was 400K, my Roth 401K was about 24K.  Since retirement I've taken about 100K out of the IRA which today is at about 550K. I've not taken anything from the Roth IRA, and it is at about 40K.

LESSONS LEARNED:

1. Should have contributed more to the Roth account (withdraws and gains are tax free) in 2012 when I started the Roth, I should have dropped the 401k to the minimum 6% to get the company match and upped the Roth to 16% or higher.
2. My estimate of Medical Cost should have been doubled.  Medicare is not free, right now I'm paying $170 mo. Medicare premium, plus $120 mo. for a part G Medigap Policy, and $25 mo. for a prescription drug plan. All of these have deductibles.
3. Although I had a pretty good estimate for what my monthly bills were going to be after retirement, I should have used a larger inflation number (I used 2%).

All in all, I feel pretty good about my current situation.  I know a lot of people in worse shape.  Everyone needs to realize that a good savings plan, and a good estimate of your need in retirement are critical but, you also need a good withdraw plan.   If you take too much out of your IRA, it can push you up into a higher bracket.  That is why the Roth is so important, all of the withdraws are tax free.  You don't have to report them as income.  It's like having a savings account with a killer interest rate (albeit a risky one)"

But it's not the theory, right? Ad absurdum, if the minimum wage was 1$ per month in US, and it increased 100% to 2$ per month, it wouldn't cause unemployment, because the minimum wage is below the average wage. Also, the theory on the matter says that minimum wage increase could lead to informal work, we can observe that a close relationship between minimum wage and average wage lead to higher informality.

Opendoor Lost Nearly 1B in Q3 selling homes at a loss now...,"During the frenzy earlier this year one of my good friends sold their house for $100k over asking price. Let me tell you..my friend was laughing all the way to the bank. He bought the house for $135,000 10 years ago, with general appreciation over the years it was worth about $225k, but because of the frenzy he listed it at $300k, he got 19 offers, and open door offered him $400k. He thought they were crazy and lying. No appraisal. No inspection. When he closed his net takeaway was something like a whopping $300,000+/-. He bought a 2 bedroom condo about 12 miles outside the city for $150k cash

Impact of Biden's 401k plan,"IMHO this is probably good. 

At a certain point the 2k is a rounding error, but the value to someone at the lower end is way higher (like as a % of my total investment amount per year this is still sub 5% - for someone just starting out building a portfolio this will be a substantial accelerant).

IMHO having every American have skin in the market is way better (both because it'll shape national policy in a more productive way) AND because if we're being honest most people in the younger generations are not set up for success (both structurally but also through not being educated about how to plan for retirement).

Auto enrolling people in IRAs now and forcing some contribution means people won't be clamoring for insane policies later."

Daily Discussion [Serious] - 17/Jun/2017,"My notes on **price movements**:

* Market is at an impasse. After the correction we've seen last week and the quick recovery that followed, moving sideways may be the deal for today and tomorrow, probably between the $335-$360 channel.

* ETHEUR, ETHUSD and ETHBTC may be forming a pennant that can be seen at the 12H, 6H and 4H charts for now. In case this is actually a pennant, it's going to be a big one. Volume has been decreasing, which may confirm the formation of the pennant.

* On a bigger scale, we're very much within the logarithmic ascending channel we've been on for a while.

* Sideways feels refreshing.


A couple of notes regarding **ETH's correlation with BTC**:

* 'The Flippening' doesn't mean leading only in terms of market cap. It means that ETH will lead in terms of macro movements. Until this happens, even if we manage to surpass BTC in terms of market cap, we'll still feel short of 'The Flippening'.

* The uncertainty surrounding BTC's UASF scheduled for the 1st of August and the set of events that may follow will have impact in ETH's movements. As an ETH trader, I will be trading the market accordingly and I'm building strategies for the different scenarios that may happen. In case we've achieved 'The Flippening' that I described above by then, we won't have reasons to worry; in case we haven't, we should follow up this big event very closely.

* Bubble talk hasn't stopped and it won't for a very long time. Even if we corrected 90% or more, there would be both 'I told you so' kind of articles as well as 'Crypto is still a big bubble' kind of opinions. I will take those opinions with a grain of salt. We're in the dawn of a financial revolution in the internet that will be confirmed as soon as scaling is achieved.


A couple of notes on the **separation of the Daily Thread**:

* The 'Serious' daily thread feels much cleaner now. I can actually read comments one by one without scrolling through 50 of them one-liners. I like to go to the 'Moontalk' thread too and let out my momentary feelings everytime they're happening.

* We should not be inclined to criticize the separation of threads. It was a democratic process, the community had the time and opportunity to vote and we did. 

* What has always made me like this community is the fact that we've always managed to be positive towards change. In this change, it should be no different. I'm both a 'Serious' and 'Moontalk' reader, but with obvious different purposes for each of them."

PASSION. You need it to stare down your 10th hr of charts followed or proceeded by the 2-3 books you need to read. Then hours of analyzing your actual trades. Ppl think this is all fun and games, but between those 2 moments of joy, there is a lot of unpleasant grinding. You will not get profitable by finding an indicator. This will just be 1 week. Next week, same thing. You have to improve every day and you have to be deliberate in your scanning/analyzing/planning/executing.

DISCIPLINE. Plan it out. Studying, backtesting, entry, exit, stops, etc. Then here's the secret, stick to the plan. Don't allow yourself to do any mental gymnastics to get out of your original plan. After it's over, analyze your plan. You followed through, but didn't get the result u wanted? Well, make a better plan. But just don't change the plan in the middle of executing it."

The Great Resignation,"I left a place that was hemorrhaging staff for a variety of reasons (culture, pay etc) about a month ago, and they're just not filling the positions quickly or, if they are there, there isn't a lot of quality. Lots of experienced staff leaving as well, which leaves a knowledge hole that takes time to replace.

Is it/should it be concering economists that different inflation metrics have wildely different estimates?,"Just so we're all on the same page, [here](https://i.imgur.com/YnuCUEw.png) is a graph of the CPI, the PCE deflator, and the GDP deflator since 1945 (since 1960 for PCE).

The CPI and PCE diverged in the late 1970s. Since then, the CPI has grown slightly faster than the PCE annually, and over time those differences have compounded. Nominal GDP is transformed into real GDP using its own deflator (the GDP deflator), which has mostly tracked the PCE deflator.

So, why has this happened?

The BLS (which produces the CPI) has a [paper](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2017/pdf/st170010.pdf) describing how CPI differs from PCE. BLS finds that the two measures include different items (a *scope effect*) and put different weights on the items they include (a *weight effect*). For example, CPI includes the prices of imported consumer goods, while PCE does not. CPI only includes out-of-pocket medical expenditures, while PCE includes medical expenses paid by insurers. The CPI puts a weight of 33% on housing, while the PCE's housing weight is only 16%. CPI's health spending weight is about 7%, while PCE's health weight is closer to 16%.

Different sectors of the economy experience different price changes, and these changes are incorporated differently in CPI and PCE.

I know that's not the most satisfying answer, but at least it gets us started."

Boss is offering a raise instead of a year-end bonus… thoughts?,"A bonus is a one-time payout, not guaranteed going forward. A raise is going to increase your comp every year, which will also increase things like 401K match (if available).

I would wait to see how much of a raise they are offering and if it is in line with the expected bonus amount."

Why is VTI so appreciated?,"The stock market is not a piggy bank.

VTI does not go up every year.  As a proxy for VTI, look at the this chart of the S&amp;P 500 (for reasons the two are highly correlated so looking at the S&amp;P gives us a glimpse of how VTI might have performed if it had existed in the past).

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)

On long enough time horizons markets tend to go up, but if we look at this chart we can see that there are significant periods of time where the market has gone down and/or sideways.

Here's the rub, there's no reliable metric to determine if the market is going to go up or down within any reasonable time frame.  I can tell you right now the market will crash in the next decade, I just couldn't tell how much it's going to go up before that happens and how far down its going to fall.  Missing 50% growth to avoid a 20% drop is a massive net negative.

Typically speaking though, for your average retail investor, investing in a product like VTI is a low cost and easy way to gain access to the total return of the American stock market.  So provided you have the time to wait out crashes / corrections, it's a reasonably place to put your money."

Because the optimal strategy is to match the other player, people setting on meeting conditions they believe are most prominent and thus more likely to be guessed by the other player. Schelling's original experiment was similar to this question, asking people to pick a time and a location anywhere in New York City to meet. The most common answer by far was noon at Grand Central Station. I'd say your original answer was correct; assuming she wanted to meet, this would be a coordination game with no exchange of information and meeting at the same time, same place is a Schelling point."

Just finished my first flip! Profit is 66k between my partner and I after 4 months. This blows my mind!,"I think it's great, but if you are going to make a go at it, you should also take a look at what your actual earnings were.  Assuming a 50/50 split, you took 33k in 4 months, which puts you at $8,250 / mo in wages (It gets taxed like wages, so it helps if we think about it as wages) Without the benefits of a W2.  The question to me, is: Is it worthwhile to keep doing this or if I spend my time working overtime or getting an education will my W2 Income increase to that level, and beyond?    


Doing one off Flips is good, but serious consideration needs to be made if you are planning on doing this full time. Also, how much of the work did you do yourself, and can you replicate this success? I've seen people who have 1 successful flip quit their day job and do it full time, usually less than 18 months later they are back at a W2 because it's more than a full time job, and the success often does not match the initial success."
"Argentina and Turkey, both upper-middle income countries, have the highest minimum wages (PPP) in the whole world.

For example Turkey changed their minimum wage a lot in 2021.

This makes their minimum wage PPP look high but actually what's happened is inflation has been huge in both countries. Meaning the minimum wage purchasing power is actually very low.

It's a mismatch between the dates of these two data sets."

How is it possible for a single company's bankruptcy to bring down the whole economy?,"&gt;They've equated to Lehman brothers in 2008 (which I don't understand). 

Lehman was a large investor in mortgage-backed securities, and Evergrande is China's largest junk bond issuer.  Basically their collapse has/had an outsized effect on the broader market because of their amount of exposure.

The concern is because construction spending accounts for about 25% of China's GDP.  In comparison, construction spending accounts for about 3.26% of US GDP.  For decades, China has engaged in questionable speculative real estate development.  Look up Chinese ""ghost cities"" to find more information.  Much of the construction boom has worked to meet increasing demand from a population that is urbanizing and upwardly mobile, but recent moves by Beijing indicate a pullback of privatization measures is coming.

It seems Evergrande has reached a deal to stay alive, but the problems it faces- too much debt due to agressive development encouraged by a government now moving to restrict development- are likely shared by several other large Chinese companies teetering on the brink."

The underperformance is massive against the S&amp;P.

Housing Prices Ruining Australia,"The shift in capital allocation in this country from business to housing is equally concerning. Banks will lend where they get the highest rate of return, and businesses have risks associated with them that housing in this country does not. People saving for a house, or paying off a large mortgage may be less likely to have a bundle of savings that they are willing to risk on funding a business. Of course there will be people who do take these risks, and there are people in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and above who have access to large amounts of capital. But again their attitudes to risk may be quite different to a person at an earlier life-stage.

TLDR: are we harming business formation and reducing productivity?"
"Luxury Travel Agencies, worth it? Recommendations?","Pasting my reply over from FATTravel:

I could write so much about this, at this point my travel agent/concierge service handles most aspects of my day-to-day life.

I've been using [Berkeley Travel](http://berkeleytravel.co.uk), a London based agency offering services globally. They charge no fees for travel, just take the standard commissions properties offer to travel agencies. However, because of this they're not really interested in clients with annual travel budgets below 250k.

Is it worth it? Absolutely. For years I used to book directly, but reading Flyertalk I eventually realised that I could save tons of money booking through somebody who has more negotiating power than me. Good agents will have contracted rates and partnership agreements with top properties, offering huge discounts and guaranteed upgrades.

For example, Berkeley is a Four Seasons preferred partner and they've managed to arrange incredible (even triple category) upgrades at multiple Four Seasons properties for me.

Money isn't the most important thing though, it's just the convenience of all of it. Before I had my PA handling my bookings for me, she's incredible but she's just not a luxury travel specialist. She'll fight for me, but she hasn't actually visited the properties I want.

The agency I work with has me in a Whatsapp group with a bunch of people able to provide expert advice within a couple of minutes. And because they actually go to the same destinations as I do, they tend to have direct lines for restaurant managers, maitre d's, etc - often enabling them to get me last minute tables even at super busy places.

Overall, I think the most important thing is to avoid the big shops. The big ones like essentialist, mrandmrssmith and velocity black are all a disaster.

Are we in a bubble?,"A simple way to disprove the assertion that ""America hasn't seen real growth, pretty much since we switched from the gold standard (in 1971)"" is to look at how [real GDP per capita has evolved](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA), approximately doubling in the last 50 years.

If, for some reason, they don't believe government statistics, then point at how the size of people's houses and the number of cars per household have drastically increased since 1970.

Even though, over the last 50 years, [household size has fallen from 3.17 to 2.5 people per household on average](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/).

And yet, the [number of cars per household has increased](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=5143).

And, the [average size of a house has increased](https://www.newser.com/story/225645/average-size-of-us-homes-decade-by-decade.html).

Also, the number of [TVs per household have increased](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2010/u-s-homes-add-even-more-tv-sets-in-2010/). And, of course, the personal computers have gone from non-existent to ubiquitous over the last 50 years.

Is it possible to have a healthy economy without varying degrees of wealth?,"An important thing to keep in mind is that inequality exists along a continuum. Its not a binary of complete equality or absolute inequality. An important measurement of inequality is the Gini coefficient. Perfect equality is a Gini coefficient of 0 and perfect inequality (wealth held by 1 person) is a Gini of 1. This is often portrayed as a percent.

No society has existed that we know of with a Gini of 0 or 1. Everything exists somewhere in the middle. The U.S. has a Gini of 0.41 (41%) while Sweden has 0.28 (28%) and South Africa 0.63 (63%.) Capitalistic societies continue to function with varying levels of inequality. 

Inequality doesn't have much to do with inflation as far as I know. Greater levels of equality will lead to higher levels of consumption as the marginal propensity to consume decreases as income increases. In other words, a poor person will spend more of any new income they receive than a rich person receiving the same amount of new income. High levels of consumption can be a factor in increased inflation, but the higher demand also drives economic growth enough to not allow it to be a problem. This is called demand pull inflation and is generally too small of a factor to worry about.

TLDR: No, a more equal society isn't going to create massive inflation. This teacher was probably arguing against a straw man of literal socialism and conflating it with lower inequality while oversimplifying how inflation works.

"It may not be a dotcom bubble, but it's likely an EV bubble","People will argue with you and say that it’s all rational and that we’re simply pricing in future earnings. People will say that Tesla having a 500+ PE ratio is rational because Tesla is changing the world and leading the way. They will invent new metrics and replace PE. Instead, they will use things like “cars delivered” to value the company. 

Just like in 2000, when hedge funds started using “website visitors” and “time on the website” and “engaged shoppers” as their new metrics instead of PE. PE was so boring in the 2000s. It was better to value a companies worth by website visitors. Just like it’s better to value a company today on vehicles delivered. 

These same people are 20-year something’s who have no recollection of any prior bubbles and just how they burst. 

You know what’s funny about all this? Back in 2000 - we had the internet bubble. The most valuable stock of all time, at the time, was Cisco. They were actually building the BACKBONES of the internet. The pipelines. The datacentres and the routers. People argued that Cisco was immune and was worth 3 digit PE valuations because they were pioneering the way forward and ahead of all the market. They were building the infrastructure and not just “another tech company”.

When the bubble burst, Cisco weren’t immune. They dropped 90%. 

Some could say that Tesla is the Cisco of the 2000s.

Bernie Sander's Economic Proposals Megathread,"A lot of focus is going to Sanders' Health Care plan but let's take a look at ""College for all"". 

By funding it with a Financial Transaction Tax (basically a sales tax on securities), Sanders' plan will reduce activity in the financial sector to the point where it can't generate the revenue it needs.

[In Italy, their FTT continues to generate less and less revenue](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2389166), meanwhile the cost of ""free"" college would continue to grow as more and more students enroll. Combine this with an additional reduction in volume from a ~60% top marginal rate on capital gains, it wouldn't be long before the government would have to dip into the rest of the budget to keep the program going. At this point, we have a drastically weakened financial sector, distorted tuition prices and a shitty choice between higher taxes, crappier federal programs or more crazy debt.

The sad thing is, one of the candidates that actually [addresses student loans in a constructive manner](http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2016/02/11-jeb-bush-student-loan-plan-chingos) just dropped out.

Put half my savings in VTI at 230...,"If you buy in to a stock at $100 and it goes to $50, and you buy in again at $50 for the same amount that you put in at $100 then your average cost of ownership is $75. 6 months or a year later when it goes back up to $75 from $50 then you’re in the black and profitable again. 

Meanwhile, anyone who bought at $100 and sold at $50 is probably still blissfully unaware of what’s going on in the real world and licking the lead paint chips that got them into that mess in the first place, while everyone else who bought in at $100 and stayed in at $50 is whaling and crying at $75 that they still have another $25 to go to get out of the red.

Does welfare pay for itself?,"There are a few ways in which having a strong welfare system can be economically beneficial. For one it allows people to spend more time searching for a job that best fits their skill set because if they have welfare benefits supporting them they don't just have to get the first job they can in order to pay the bills. 
Welfare systems also help people stay fed which is important for economic reasons because hunger causes a decline in cognitive and physical performance which can impact a producers efficiency both in the short and long term. This effect is especially profound in children who can suffer long term decreases in academic performance from hunger. In the case of Medicaid or other health related welfare programs they help the economy by keeping people healthy and thus more productive. Preventing homelessness with welfare is also a way to prevent declines in a person's productivity. 

If people don't have any legitamite ways to take care of themselves like welfare they will oftent imes resort to crime in order to just survive and crime is very expensive economically speaking. 

Welfare systems can also encourage innovation and risk taking by ensuring that if a business venture fails the entrepreneur doesn't become homeless and starve. 

The welfare money spent also stimulates the economy by increasing demand"

Why doesn't Japan print money to avoid deflation?,"As a preamble, you should understand that money supply and interest rates are inextricably linked; usually, to increase money supply is to lower interest rates (and vice versa). Among economists, there are two common schools of thought (Keynesian and Monetarist) on how money and interest rates affects inflation and the economy.  

The Keynesians hold that in the short run, inflation accelerates when [Aggregate Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand) exceeds the  productive capacity of the economy (Aggregate Supply), and inflation decelerates when Aggregate Demand is less than Aggregate Supply. Further, the Long Run is just an aggregation of the short run. Thus, the main process affecting inflation is the gap between demand and supply in the economy as a whole. 

In the Keynesian view, the central bank affects inflation by lowering interest rates (whilst increasing money supply). Lower interest rates increase investment and consumption, thus increasing Aggregate Demand. Usually, a central bank can increase inflation by increasing money supply and lowering interest rates, but Japan is caught in a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap). The central bank cannot [decrease interest rates below zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound), no matter how much they increase money supply.  Since interest rates do not fall, Aggregate Demand does not increase, thus, the Japanese economy remains mired in deflation. 

I'll leave the monetarist position for someone from the monetarist school to explain."

At What Point Does The Federal Deficit Become A Problem?,"&gt; At what point does this become unsustainable? Is it at $50T in debt? $100T?

It's best not to think of it like that. It's not a binary thing. People tend to get deficits and debt wrong. I often here people asking - ""Will the debt cause a crisis?"" For most developed countries the answer is ""No"", but it's the wrong question.

The problem with debt is not so much that it causes crises. It's that it must be maintained. The government must continually pay out interest to bondholders. That interest must come from taxes. Of course, for a few years a government can borrow to pay the interest, but that only increases the size of the debt.

A higher debt means that tax revenues have to be high enough to maintain it. Taxes entail deadweight loss. They discourage whatever is being taxed. If income is taxed that means they discourage earning income. Therefore they discourage production and work generally. This issue with high national debts has nothing to do with a debt being large enough to be dangerous.

So, when are things truly ""dangerous""? In other words, when is a government at risk of crisis? You sometimes hear people say that debt is dangerous when it can't be paid back. This isn't really true. Nobody expects a government to pay back all at once. Or to pay back the whole amount ever.

You have to remember that the US gets a very low interest rate on it's debt, but not zero interest. Those interest payments amounts are really more important than the amount of debt itself. 

It is possible for the national debt maintenance to become larger than what the government could possibly obtain in tax revenue. The US is very far from that point though.

There are advantages to borrowing as well as disadvantages. Though I'm sceptical that most of those advantages apply in practice.

I'll link to some of our previous comments on this [thread1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/zm6ns1/what_is_the_specific_fear_regarding_national_debt/), [thread2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/kx9773/when_does_national_debt_a_deficit_become_dangerous/), [thread3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/rcmuqq/at_what_point_does_national_debt_become_critical/) and [thread4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/nycfl9/is_the_us_government_debt_actually_a_cause_for/)."

I'm saving and investing more money with no goals. Any suggestions to manage it shrewdly?,"No matter who you are, you'll always atleast have a retirement goal. So that's always there.

And I do believe you should look at a fee only financial advisor to help you with this goal. Especially because you're in IT, you ideally hope to work till 60. 

Working with a planner would give you a clear target for atleast this goal. This means you'll have a number attached to it, say for example, that you need 10cr by the time you reach 50. (You don't need to stop working if you have the money. It's just that you're not dependent on your job, free to pursue whatever you'd like). And then you have a barometer to measure anything in your life - like what is affordable for you and what is not. Are you making enough in your current job to reach that number or do you need to change things up. You'll always have a compass.

Once you have that goal that will mean that you will have an asset allocation (between debt and equity) and that you'll periodically rebalance it hence locking the gains from the better asset class into the other one which is a very crucial step in wealth building, otherwise all gains are just notional only and can vanish in a matter of days."

All it takes is a few of these trolls to make life very unpleasant for the rest of us (you know their names).  And all it takes is an errant troll comment or two to turn off someone who was posting useful comment for weeks, months, or maybe even years- and then never want to come back.

If you see this type of behavior, please downvote and move on.  Or if you comment, do it in a way that explains why you find their behavior unacceptable and how they can do better next time, without becoming a type of troll yourself.  Otherwise, engaging trolls is like a digital version of rubbernecking- slowing things down for everyone else and making things generally unpleasant.  

And FYI, this type of behavior are the only comments I downvote here.  If you disagree with me / someone else and express yourself in a cordial manner with some intelligent points, I am actually likely to upvote you.

ELI5: How does money grow by 10% in the stock market every year? Where does that 10% come from?,"The returns come from capital growth and from profits. The shareholders are owners of the business. Each share is a share of the whole firm, a slice of it. So, when the firm makes a profit they own that profit too. Similarly, when the firm grows the share of the firms that each share represents grows too.

A firm can pay profits to it's shareholders in various ways. It can issue dividends, it can buyback stock. It can also reinvest the profits in growth. If that reinvestment creates growth then it increases the price of the shares for that reason, as discussed above.

As you mention yourself, inflation also increases the price of shares. But to get the real growth we have to subtract inflation. As you say that gives, ~7% in real terms per year. That percentage is a fairly consensus estimate for long-run returns to the US stock market."

second point: 

#recognize the difference between floor and peak.. 

question: why aiming exorbitant high (let’s say for 69,420,000 USD) and having a floor at 10,000,000 USD is good..?

in my opinion, it is necessary to aim that high, bc if not, more apes are going out early and the rocket could fall back..

so.. again, i hodl for not less than 10,000,000 USD a share and only selling AFTER the peak, means on the way down. no matter how long this will take.

this means, if the price will get above 10,000,000 USD (like up to around my real aim: 200,000,000 USD) and starting to fall back for, lets say, 20%, THEN i will sell.

in this scenario i will sell my shares (each share!) in every case for not less than 8,000,000 USD FOR SURE! and this means not, that the rocket will fall back directly after i sold.. i will not sell all my shares at once. every ape can have a different peak, my floor advise for myself is 10,000,000 USD as the MINIMUM.. for a life changing money for apes!

What is the Economic Consensus of $15 Federal Minimum Wage?,"You can read the REN FAQ on the Minimum Wage [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=AskEconomics&amp;utm_content=t5_2selg), but I think it should be updated soon, as there's a lot of high-quality work on the minimum wage being done recently in top journals.  In the last year, we've had [Dube et al. in the QJE](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905), [Harasztosi &amp; Lindner in the AER](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20171445), and [Gopalan et al. in the JOLE](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2963083), as well as a new meta-analysis from [Belman &amp; Wolfson](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/labr.12162?casa_token=_T1qNY90k-gAAAAA%3AWdiw9vVsn5ZOTCBOSrfiVmYKeLpX1nHJBMqyQBHm7KI1aUbsieOGQQhGkg6xKPscGltoQlbOtecftw), all of which generally point to the same set of conclusions about minimum wages.

**Minimum Wages Raise Incomes for Minimum Wage Workers** 

The literature is consistent in finding that raising the minimum wage raises the wages of low-skilled workers.  What's more, increasing the minimum wage also has ""spillover effects"".  For example, a higher-skilled technician making $16/hour might get a raise as the result of a minimum wage increase to $15/hour in order to maintain a higher wage *relative* to her lower-skilled coworkers.  There's also substantial evidence that minimum wage increases reduce poverty and increase public health on net.

**Minimum Wages Have (Small) Disemployment Effects**

Research on minimum wages has progressed significantly since the famous dueling studies of Card and Krueger and Neumark and Wascher in the 1990s, and this progress is summarized in Belman and Wolfson's newest meta-analysis, which finds that the ""consensus range"" for employment elasticities is -0.13 to -0.07, which is both significantly narrower and moderately closer to the origin then previous estimates, which typically ranged from -0.3 to -0.1.  This ""consensus range"" comes after adjustments for publication bias are made, which was a major concern in previous meta-analyses.  More recently, Gopalan et al. and Haraszotsi &amp; Lindner's point estimates are both around -0.1, and even Dube et al. capture the entirety of the -0.13 to -0.07 range in their 95% confidence intervals of elasticity estimates.  

**Minimum Wage Increases are Generally Paid for by Increased Prices for Consumers**

This is the focus of Lindner &amp; Haraszotsi's AER piece, but there's good indirect evidence for consumers bearing most of the brunt of minimum wage increases in both Dube et al. and Gopalan et al., who both find large disemployment effects of minimum wages in the tradeable goods sector.  This is likely because tradeable goods have higher product demand elasticities, making it much more difficult to pass on the increased costs from the minimum wage to consumers in the form of higher prices.  Intuitively, if every fast food place in my town raises the price of a combo meal by $1, my decisions regarding fast food probably won't change, since I have few alternatives, but the same might not be true for pencils, since I have more alternatives that may not be affected by the minimum wage increase.  

**Minimum Wages Have Different Employment Effects in Different Geographic Locations**

While it hasn't been peer-reviewed yet, [Azar et al.'s working paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3416016) on labor market concentration is also a great read, as it sheds light on heterogeneity in the disemployment effect by geographic regions.  In general, they affirm the consensus of a negative, but small, employment effect around -0.1 in highly populated urban areas with many employers, but find that the effect is close zero in more rural areas with fewer employers, and is even positive in those areas with the most monopsonistic labor markets.  



Reading the previous [IGM survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/) on the minimum wage shows that economists were divided on the magnitude of the employment effects of the minimum wage, but were in general agreement regarding the benefits of a minimum wage increase exceeding the costs.  There's very good evidence that minimum wages make the people they are intended to help noticeably better off, without causing large harm elsewhere.  Economists would probably agree that minimum wages are inefficient by the Kaldor-Hicks criteria; the dollar losses of consumers, employers, and displaced workers likely slightly outweigh the gains to minimum wage workers, but the losses are spread over a wide number of people and the efficiency losses are small.  In addition, the minimum wage is politically viable and already in place, neither of which could be said for a Phelps-style wage subsidy.  

Sorry for the wall of text, I've been wanting to do an effortpost on the latest research on the minimum wage for a while, and wasn't sure if editing the FAQ was considered kosher."
My wheel guide,"Key factor for a lot of people is going to be keeping the cash in reserve.  I see a lot of screenshots with buying power being far under what’s in play, with people keeping next to nothing as a reserve.  Can’t really wheel if you don’t have the cash to sell the put options.

Therapist here. I think it's time to talk about our emotional experience of this whole thing.,"This is me venting: Its crazy how this shouldn't be such a big deal just buy and hold.

Have there been any successes in nationalising certain industries?,"Military and police is probably the best example of nationalizations.

Flipping done right can be rewarding financially and also as an accomplishment."
What would happen if everyone refused to pay their debts?,"A financial crisis. If people stopped paying debts, this would disrupt the flow of money to the banking system, as such they would either contract their lending (reducing the growth of the money supply) or collapse (reducing the money supply).

Assignment is a LIE! (and the TRUTH behind The Wheel),"I see your point, and I love your passion. However, thinking in absolutes tends to lead us astray.

“The Wheel” really is just a glorified reiteration of a similar trade, arbitrarily below or above the spot, depending on the iteration of the cycle. Almost all CSPs are written OTM (ATM at most). If assigned, almost all CCs are written OTM (ATM at most) until called away … and the cycle continues with OTM CSPs. No DD tends to happen on the actual valuation of the underlying that should ultimately determine the strike over which the contract is written. Willing to undergo assignment here tends to be arbitrary.

However, assignment *can* be a cost-effective avenue to acquiring desired shares, if there is no assignment fee, and the put writer wants to avoid crossing the bid/ask spread to close the CSP and crossing the bid/ask spread to buy the shares. (S)he already owns the shares nominally at the strike via the CSP (granted the underlying doesn’t shove it out of the money by expiration). Assignment realizes that ownership without feeding the market makers.

Thus, awareness and intent is key here."

Need Help! Financial Advisor charged my parents ridiculously high fees to do very litte.,"The reason that their portfolio with this ripoff advisor looks so confusing is because they put money into a large number of funds so it looks like they are doing something worth paying them for.

You can simplify their portfolio into just VTWAX and BND or BNDW and it will be just as if not more effective. I'd say with their ages a 60/40 equity to bond ratio would be fine.

Is this portfolio with fidelity right now? If not and you're transferring it anyway I would recommend vanguard but you could definitely use fidelity if you're more familiar/comfortable with their platform.

If you do go with fidelity I would recommend 35% FZROX (Total US Equity Index), 25% FZILX (Total Intl Equity Index), and 40% FXNAX (US Bond Index)."
"Why do we work 8 hours a day, has this been proven to be the most productive length?","I'm a little sceptical of the explanations given so far.

Certainly, unions campaigned for the 8 hour workday. I expect that this did reduce working hours. But, still, there is no clear break in the data on working hours. Working hours didn't suddenly reduce to 8 hours as a discrete event because of a campaign. Rather, they steadily fell, probably for a large variety of reasons. That happened for many years, both before an after the campaign for the 8 hour working day.

Take a look at [this](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-per-worker).

Unions played a part in that, so did legislation and so did worker preferences."

How can China afford to shut down their economy during Covid outbreaks?,"China is experiencing ongoing economic distress this year from the 0 Covid policy. [This World Bank report](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/09/26/east-asia-and-pacific-sustaining-growth-restraining-inflation-but-facing-risks-ahead) has some information. The number that jump out is the dramatic slowdown in growth from 2021 to 2022. 
&gt; China, which previously led recovery in the region, is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2022, a sharp deceleration from 8.1% in 2021

In 2021 things were largely back to normal here except for restrictions on international travel. This year it has been ongoing lockdowns popping, including the protracted lockdown of all of Shanghai. I haven't seen a full estimate of the cost of that, but it must be staggering. To this day, those of us living in Shanghai have to get a PCR test at least every three days. To facilitate that there are 100's of free Covid testing stations usually staffed five days a week, morning to night. Within 1km of my home there are at least 20, I can't imagine what the ongoing cost is. Some of the money has come out of city funds, but it is somewhat opaque who is paying for what.

There have been no direct payments to people during these years. During the 2022 Shanghai lockdown, some residential compounds received rations provided through the neighbourhood committees and there was a general understanding that no one was to be fired or evicted during that time. Retail and service workers, for example, would receive some % of their regular salary.

This has been the general approach, expecting businesses to contribute to keeping people solvent. To support businesses, there have been a number of tax and fee relief policies. It's a patchwork of solutions that vary province to province, [this article](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/what-tax-incentives-can-businesses-enjoy-under-the-shanghai-lockdown/) has a good overview of what is available to Shanghai businesses. 

How effective these are is debatable, and I'm a little skeptical. [240,000](https://thechinaproject.com/2020/04/09/more-than-240000-chinese-companies-declare-bankruptcy-in-the-first-two-months-of-2020/) businesses declared bankruptcy in the first two months of 2022, for example, and I heard the number was 500,000 in that quarter. Also, all the rent relief my company received in 2020 had to be paid back which was a challenge.

So, I think we can say China can afford all the Covid policy related costs in that the money exists to cover direct costs and the government is willing to forego tax and fee revenue. It would be a mistake, however, to think there is no impact to the economy. There is and, just looking at macro numbers, it is significant."

Huge lesson I just learned unfortunately.,"You weren't burned by the broker.  What you did was buy something, then sell it, and keep the profits.  But the broker, even in a cash account, bought and sold something, and that transaction takes time to complete (for all brokers).  So the next time you bought something, even in a cash account, you were doing it with THEIR money, because they already spent yours.  And then you sold.  Now they owe you a profit and they have to still complete the transaction using their own cash.  **They didn't burn you.  You burned them.**  That's why it's called a ""good faith violation.""  You asked for a cash account, and you used margin NOT IN GOOD FAITH."

What do you make of the Chitra Ramakrishna NSE scam? It's bizarre that she was allowed to get away with it by the NSE Board,"&gt;an invisible, shape-shifting Himalayan Yogi 

It has already been reported that it was Anand Subramanian himself on the other side of the email.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On January 18, 2013, Subramanian was offered the role of Chief Strategic Advisor at NSE for an annual compensation of ₹1.68 crore against his last drawn salary (as per his claim) of ₹15 lakh at Balmer Lawrie. In March 2014, Ramkrishna approved a 20 per cent increment to Subramanian and his salary was revised to ₹2.01 crore. Five weeks thereafter, Subramanian’s salary was again revised upwards by 15 per cent to ₹2.31 crore as Ramkrishna dubbed his performance to be A+ (exceptional). By 2015, his cost-to-company had zoomed to ₹5 crore, he was given a cabin next to Ramkrishna and granted first-class international air travel. All this was in accordance with the yogi’s instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;even carried the diktat that Subramanian be exempt from the contractual   
5-day work week and instead be asked to come only for three days and   
allowed to work the rest of the time at will.

Essentially, do you want to buy a house and let your parents pay you rent (equivalent to the mortgage payment) to live in it? The answer is probably no."
Have past funds like ARK crashed or just slowed down?,"Active stock ETFs are a new thing that Ark pretty much invented.

Lots of hedge and mutual fund managers have been around for ages, though.

They’re all over the map in terms of long-term performance. Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, and James Simons (his Renaissance fund, not others) are among the better-known long-term performers.

The danger for successful funds is they eventually attract so much money, it gets hard to make the same trades, especially investments in smaller companies.

Buffet’s performance declined in later decades. 

Lynch was successful his entire career running Magellan, but only ran it 13 years.

Simons solved the “getting too big” problem by limiting his fund size to about $10 billion. He’s kicked out nearly all his investors now, and serves just a handful of insiders.His gross returns have averaged 66% annually, for 20+ years.

Ark can’t close the doors like that though.

Ark also takes a different approach from most fund managers, by focusing on disruptive innovation. A few others, like Baillie Gifford and SoftBank do some of this too, but they don’t run ETFs serving retail investors.

SoftBank has a reputation for making some big, awful bets, especially in the private markets with companies like WeWork. 

I think Ark’s approach is a winning formula. I try to emulate their approach in my investments, investing in companies I think have massive runways for growth.

But managing its growth and success will be a challenge for Ark to solve."
"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.","&gt;Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your 1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034 [8].

Pretty important caveat there. Since you can't possibly invest in everything he recommends, unless you have some way of knowing what those 1% are beforehand (you don't), investing based on his advice is pointless."

"Why is it that in service based industries, such as ISPs or phone network provision, the consumer has almost no choice, and this is status quo?","Your observation does not hold true for service industries in general, and holds true for these specific industries primarily because isps and phone providers are basically utilities. There are extremely high cost s for entry, so a genuinely competitive market structure is out of the question. A duopoly is common, monopoly not entirely uncommon ( depending on how the market is defined), and an oligopoly is the standard.

Speaking about cell phone companies, contracts primarily make sense because they allow people to buy new phones frequently without huge upfront costs that would turn most consumers off. I would say contacts are what consumers demand in that market, and that's whats provided as a result.


Back to isps, there is a strong argument for more regulation while the law simply doesn't regulate them. I'm not sure they should be regulated just because they limit bandwidth to their top .5% of customers.

Received a Job offer with the lowest pay option and was told to call back with a counter offer. No idea what I'm doing.,"I wrote this a few years ago to help some people I was mentoring.  Here you go!

To negotiate successfully you must understand that this is your biggest and best opportunity to control your compensation. Raises, when offered, are typically 2-3% of your base. Successfully negotiating your salary up front can earn an additional 10-30%. Negotiations are often uncomfortable but that few minutes of discomfort will be well worth while.

1: Be willing to negotiate.

2: Put off talking salary for as long as you possibly can. Identify everything else and get them emotionally committed:

A. Job= Title, reporting Relationship, Responsibilities, Budget and Authority, Performance expectations, Possible Future, B. Salary, fringe benefits, review date C. Starting date

This is the order that you want to negotiate as it will position you for the best job with the highest compensation package. However, many employers will want to approach this differently for their purposes.

Here are some ways to delay salary discussions when they are premature:

Scripts to delay salary discussions

    “I really need to know more about the duties and responsibilities of this position before I would feel comfortable in discussing money. Does that seem reasonable?”

    ""I just make it a policy not to discuss salary until we are at the offer stage.”

    “It sounds as if you are working within a budget. Did you have a range in mind for this position?”

Rule Number 1 Ask for their number before disclosing yours.

    “I would be looking at a total compensation package valued at________________.”

    ""I recognize that you are a small business and I am confident that we can work out something that will work for both of us.""

    “I have some flexibility in certain areas that we can work with. Let’s meet and discuss your needs and we can go from there.”

It is important to look at each situation for its merit. If we get fixated on one number we may forego opportunity.

Make sure everyone knows what you’re talking about when you are talking money.

Know that you will start with a number that is higher than you think you can get.

Finally, you need to decide an appropriate salary range for the job you are looking for. Research your field and know the appropriate ranges.

IT IS TIME TO NEGOTIATE You have experienced significant interest demonstrated by the hiring authority. You may inwardly feel some ambivalence about the position at this point. They say “Well, what are your ideas about salary?” “What are your salary goals?” “What could get you excited?” or “What could you get by on?”

Present the following script (All five points) with direct eye contact, being careful that your voice volume doesn’t diminish when you get to the number.

SCRIPT FOR PRESENTING YOUR OPENING POSITION

    “The opportunity is as important as the starting salary which I know we can agree on.

    Based on what I’ve been earning (or present standard of living) and

    Other opportunities I’m looking at,

    And goals I’ve set for myself,

    I would expect to be at the ___________ level within the next 12 months. (Stating this time frame is critically important. It gives you wiggle room as you move forward.)

Rule Number Two The first one who speaks loses!

You will observe many things. Some will laugh at you, smile, yell, sigh, or gasp. Some will start mumbling, spinning around in their chair, walking, doodling, or staring off.

Three things you will hear:

    (What you don’t want to hear) “No problem, we can do that.” (You’ve undersold yourself.)

    (what you do want to hear.) “That’s more than we were planning on paying. We were going to start you at the _____________ amount.”

    (what you do want to hear.) “That’s more than we were planning on paying. Period.

Do Not Go Further Without Getting Their Number.

Rule Number Three

A good negotiating session is a process of commenting, not reacting. So I might say something like, “We have somewhat of a gap.”

Now your strategy is to move to the benefits discussion. The reason for this is to find something to agree on.

So I might say something like “In order to evaluate your offer I would have to see it in the context of the total offer. Could you tell me about your benefits package?”

Benefits can be Insurance, Retirement, 401K, Bonuses, Stock, Severance Pay, Education such as conferences, college tuition, trade shows or outplacement services. Transportation such as car allowance, Vehicle, frequent flyer miles, VIP rooms during out of town stays, Relocation expenses, Time off, Non traditional arrangements such as Home Offices, Flex Time or Use of Company Assets.

Homework Identify your top 20 preferences in order of priority and then research how much it would cost you to pay for this out of your own pocket.

After the hiring authority has outlined the benefit package (don’t get bogged down in details at this point as they may not know all the details.) comment on something you liked, then return to a salary discussion. For example,

“Mr.______ I particularly like your tuition reimbursement program. I was hoping for more vacation the first year, but all in all you have a pretty good package. I want to talk with you again about the salary level as it is lower than I want to start.”

How to increase your perceived value. Power statements such as:

“Based on my ____________ I can do ____________ which will result in ____________ for you, which justifies a higher salary.”

IE: ""Based on my recent MBA, I can impact both your sales and marketing teams which will result in less training time and a faster start for you which justifies my higher starting salary.""

You need to stay in the process, be patient, give them time, give them time to go away but keep the tension in the process.

Four Ways to Wrap Up the deal

    Split the difference

    Reframe the Number

    Trade off money for something else that is valuable to you. Stock. Vacation. Etc.

    Bring in the fact of another offer.

Final Points to negotiate:

A. Review date

B. Your future with company 3-5 years down the road."
Whose the biggest bagholder of them all?,"I acquired 1500 ether in 2016 before the DAO hack for about 19k. I remember it got down to 8 dollars that December and I was down almost 40 percent and I felt stupid. I didn't start selling until it hit 500 last year. I sold 100 eth at 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1100. Made a couple dumb repurchases in the 800-1200 range. On the way down sold half my remaining eth and repurchased again in the 300 range. All said and done I still have 1,000 eth, about 70k usd worth of omisego and BAT. And I made out with 300k in profits after taxes. When eth was at ATH OF 1400 I had just under 2 million dollars. I told myself I'd sell everything if it hit 2 million and it never did. Whatever. "

"IMPORTANT: This is why they mentioned ""more than a majority represented"" at the meeting. It's simple. Read this. Please.","Out of all the votes allowed, more than 50% of them have voted. That's ALL that was communicated.

Does that mean more than 75% voted? &gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe not. The words don't speak to that.

Does that mean more than 100% voted? &gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe not. The words don't speak to that.

Does that mean more than 50% voted? &gt;&gt; YES. That is ALL that was communicated.

---------------------

Edit 1: If the reporting is correct, the wording was actually ""there are present at this meeting in person or by proxy"", so where I originally said:
&gt; Out of the all the votes allowed, more than 50% of them have voted.

It would be more correct to say:
&gt; Out of all the votes allowed, more than 50% of the voters were accounted for.

This in NO WAY changes the overall intent and point of my above reply. Specifically, that what was stated by the secretary at the meeting in no way means that there were more votes than shares."
If I become wealthier am I blocking someone else from doing the same?,"It depends on a few different factors.

So the first thing to consider is productivity; whether your business is more efficient than the one that came before it and what they'd otherwise be doing. Specialization of labor dictates that everyone becomes wealthier when people do what they're good at. If it is then you're actually growing the economy and expanding the [production possibilities frontier](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Competitive_markets/Economic_growth.html), by making things less expensively and growing the market thus making the economy stronger for everyone.

The next factor to consider is the size of the market, are you going after an existing or shrinking pool of customers or is it actually expanding? In an expanding market you can simply service new demand by opening an existing business, in a shrinking market (think stage coach manufacturers after cars) then yes it is likely zero-sum. The business cycle is also a factor in this as well and it will be easier to grow in an expansionary cycle and harder in a recession.

A final factor I'll leave you with is the availability of alternatives and consumer spending. If your business is more attractive than other industries you may see a growth as people take money from other areas to spend it on your business. Think perhaps the rise of grocery delivery services and meal-in-a-box kits. The kits are obviously more expensive than the grocery store, but service a different convince niche. Consumers may shift their spending from the grocery stores and probably restaurants and take-out/carry-away businesses  as well. This would generally be described in economics as a shift between different customer market segements.

What you're referring to would be known by economists and game theorists as zero-sum game. In order for you to win someone else has to lose. Sometimes this is indeed the case, other times it is not. You must look at where your customers are coming from and what they'd otherwise be doing to understand if it's the case or not."

"Warren Buffett, in  an interview with CNBC , offers one of the best quotes about the debt ceiling.","I know this quote has made its way into chain emails, etc, but just to be clear: Warren Buffet wasn't seriously suggesting that we do this. He was trying to point out that the deficit wasn't the real problem (he's belittling the problem by saying he could solve it in five minutes.) The real problem was (I'll use past tense since this interview was so long ago...) lack of jobs. If you're trying to create jobs, forcing Congress to get rid of the deficit isn't necessarily the right course of action (especially if you support, say, a new jobs bill.)

I don't want to argue how bad the deficit is, I'm just saying, go watch the interview. Buffet was trying to be dismissive about the worried talk about the deficit that was coming from the GOP as they were threatening to shut down the government. "

1) Ensure that your broker account is a cash account (not a margin account). If you have a margin account, try to convert to cash (you may need to add some funds).

2) Ensure that there are no pending transactions that have yet to be cleared and settled (for GME or others that may impact the cash balance). Remember in US markets settlement happens in T+2 business days.

3) Ensure that the transfer fee (if any) is covered (this can depend on the total fund balance being transferred). ACAT transfers (broker to broker) are usually free.

4) Ensure you have set a cost basis for your shares (if your broker requires this. IBKR does).  After the transfer, double check that the basis was sent over correctly.

5)  Double check with the policies on cryptocurrencies. Some brokers do not support Crypto positions and that portion of your account may not be able to be transferred over. Be clear on this up front otherwise there may be delays.

6) Ensure that you do not have any open options positions that will expire within a few weeks. (thanks r/vaseline_sandwich)

7) Ensure that you keep whatever minimum cash position your current broker requires to keep your account open (Some brokers require that you maintain some minimum cash balance) (thanks r/boborygmy)


Above all else, do not get pressured into selling your shares and then buying them back at the new broker.

GameStop is planning on DPO'ing GME-E onto blockchain exchange. Cohen's tweets deciphered. GG.,"Made this comment on the other post. Dropping it here too. 

u/ganggangbet I think you may be onto something here. We need a full DD on this and it needs more eyes in my opinion. 

Also, for anyone interested, go read what a DPO is: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directpublicoffering.asp

Essentially, it’s a way to do an IPO without banks and intermediaries.

*it also says DPOs are perfect for companies with dedicated client/investor bases.*

“Carve outs” usually come before spin-offs. In a carve out, a company issues up to 20% of the subsidiary’s stock through an IPO (assuming a DPO is what GameStop would do).

After the carve out, comes the full spin off where the other 80% is issued to the holders of the parent stock via dividend."
"What should I do with $123,000 at 17?","1) Keep your mouth shut! Don’t tell anyone you have access to that kind of coin - they will ask for loans, gifts or stupid ideas like opening a restaurant or you being a “silent” partner in home construction.  Say no to all of that, the fastest way to lose money is to give it away freely.
2) Pick up a book - The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C Bogle.  
3) Before you spend or invest a single penny, make sure what you are buying, why you are buying it and what your end game for that investment is."

Netlix crashed 20% overnight. But it is still overvalued.,"So NFLX reported a diluted EPS of $11.24, with a current p/e of 35. 

a pricetag of $250 would put them into a p/e of 22.

so just based on p/e i think they are fairly valued. Growth of 9% in US, 8% in EU y/o/y. Lacking in LATAM (5%) and ASIA (4%), but here is potential.

forward p/e of around 30ish if they grow their earnings by 10%, with price hikes more like 25 i guess."

UPenn analysis estimates that Joe Biden’s economic plan would cost 5.37 trillion while bringing in 3.375 trillion over a 10 year period. It also estimates that Joe Biden’s plan would decrease federal debt by 6.2% how is this possible?,"Biden's economic platform will raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue within the 2021 – 2030 window. The projected 6.1% reduction in federal debt is by 2050, twenty years after the estimated window.

In particular, see the last key point:

&gt; In total, including macroeconomic and health effects, the Biden platform increases federal debt by 0.1 percent in 2030 before decreasing debt by 1.9 percent in 2040 and 6.1 percent in 2050; GDP decreases by 0.4 percent in 2030, sees no change in 2040, and increases by 0.8 percent in 2050.

So you are right, from 2021 to 2030, Biden's platform is expected to increase federal debt."
Why wasn’t raising the minimum wage bad before?,"I'm going to focus more on the second part about the belief that raising the minimum will destroy the economy. It really comes down to politics. Lobbyists and ""pro"" business politicians making the conversation around minimum wage distorted or ignores the empirical evidence around raising the minimum wage.

 Among nonpolitical economists, the view of minimum wage is not that it will force a mass shutdown of businesses or cause inflation. However, based on my readings, they are concerned about how raising the minimum wage will affect the supply of lower wage and lower skilled jobs. As we can already observe, automation is rapidly increasing. We see it in grocery stores, manufacturing, warehousing, etc. Raising the minimum wage will speed up automation by lowering the opportunity cost for firms to invest in automation. 

I haven't looked to much into the research on this subject on my own. This is more communicating what economists generally think about minimum wage, based on my readings. That being said, if I'm a policy maker, and this is what the experts are telling me, raising the minimum wage should come with other programs, such as training and early retirement for those immediately affected. The other part of this, the problem of which is something that will need to be addressed regardless of raising the minimum wage, is long term thinking on education to make sure workers in the future are qualified for the higher skilled jobs."
The Glass Castle - New Game +,"So wait let me get this straight:

You claim that Loopring is working with Gamestop to develop a Singular NFT that can be fragmented into several NFTs that can then be distributed to all shareholders and GME can then act as a democratized company with shareholders using their NFT fragments to voice their will. If shorts do not cover when papi says they have to, then all shareholders (real or synthetic) get moved over to the GME NFT fragment?

Why is VTI so appreciated?,"VTI basically invests in thousands of US companies across sectors. The idea is that you can’t predict what companies or sectors will do best for specific timespans so you should invest in all of them, and the assumption is that over the long term the winners do much better than the losers and the economy as a whole goes up. It may not be the best returns for a specific 5-10 year period but over 30+ years it should (or may) have close to the best returns you can get.

When people say it always goes up they don’t mean it can’t go down but that over a long enough timeframe it should always go up. So while you can buy “at the top” if you buy before a crash, that’s only a local maximum: there should be a higher “top” in the future."

Achieving High Income in Tech,"I’m a Director of Software Engineering at a FANG. IT is completely different from software. In IT, a number of tickets come your teams way and you have metrics to hit on mean time to resolution etc. You don’t necessarily deal with setting vision, selling the vision, converting this vision to a tech roadmap, and then executing on this roadmap with several challenges along the way.

If I was in your place, I would try to get into a FANG at any level and in any job family. A Tech Program Manager (TPM) role might be a good fit for you (but you haven’t really shared enough info about your skill set). A mid level TPM individual contributor will make around $300k here. This will be a hard pill to swallow in terms of going from managing people to an individual contributor, and from running the show as a director to becoming a minor artist in someone else’s play. 

But do it anyway. You need the brand on your resume first. Once you’ve established your credibility, you can try to internally move into either a Manager of TPMs role, or even an engineering manager role. This is very common btw. I’ve personally moved 2 TPMs to SDM roles. 

I was making $400k as a Senior Director of Engineering at a small brand. Joined FANG a couple levels below it as a Senior Manager but they doubled my comp to 800k. After 3 years, I jumped ship to another FANG, nearly doubling it again to 1.5M. 

So a combination of getting into FANG first and then switching roles followed by job hopping is the best way to increase your compensation."
is recession the only way out of inflation in all history?,"Although it is true that inflation usually slows down when there is a recession, it is incorrect to say that the *only* time inflation slows down is when there is a recession.

First, as pointed out by u/Econoboi, a decrease in the cost of production -- from technological progress or cheaper imported raw materials (as for example, when oil prices fell in the 1990s) -- can slow down inflation without an accompanying recession.

Second, if people widely anticipate lower prices (because, for example, a war is ending), inflation can slow down without causing a recession. 

Third, during hyperinflations, when inflation is wildly fluctuating, and inflation expectations are non-existent, inflation can quickly slow down without causing a recession if the rate of money growth is cut.

Also, note that sometimes higher inflation and a recession can occur together. This can happen if there is a 'supply shock', an increase in the cost of producing goods and services. This famously happened during the 'stagflation' of the 1970s."

Is inflation 'always and solely a monetary phenomenon'?,"This is not true, and it is a fringe belief. 

Afghanistan is experiencing really high inflation, but they actually outsourced their money printer to external actors, so money printing isn't causing that inflation.

Combine poor boundaries with poor sense of finances and you have trouble. I'm happy to see from other comments you will not loan money. It will be the beginning of the end of your FIRE journey. On top of that giving money with no contingencies and collateral means you won't be solving the root cause of the issues. To fix her problems she's gonna need to learn to fish.

With all that out of the way you need to have a sit down with your mother and spell out how you value and cherish her, and she raised you to be the good person you are. You believe she can be just as successful as you with money, if she is willing to listen and work. Tell her you giving her money will not solve the reason why she is in a tight spot.You want to work with her to solve her problems, but it will not entail you giving her money.

If she reacts poorly, then you need to set firm boundaries. That will not be easy on you, but it is the only way to get her to possibly be open to the idea of being responsible with money as it's the only way she will get to see you (save for never asking for money again of course). 


Edit: Thank you for the gold! 
"
Why do “preppers” invest in hard currencies for an apocalypse?,"Gold, for example, has physical properties that made it historically a good choice for storage of value. For instance, it's very resistant to ~~corruption~~ corrosion (you don't want your ersatz money rotting or rusting) and it's soft with a low melting point so it's easy to divide to make coins or other tokens. All of these features -- and others --  that historically made gold attractive as a medium of value will presumably still be desirable after the Great Collapse. But immediately after the bombs drop and the zombie plague begins, gold won't be of much interest as survival is a bigger deal. However, as civilization picks itself back up, it will be useful again. I doubt most preppers really think through it that deeply, though, and just mentally associate gold with value.

Why is the US student loan interest rate so high even though they're federal loans?,"[The default rate is actually really high.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/25/opinion/sunday/student-debt-loan-default-college.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Consider the [official statistics](https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/schooltyperates.pdf): Of borrowers who started repaying in 2012, just over 10 percent had defaulted three years later. That’s not too bad — but it’s not the whole story. Federal data never before released shows that the default rate continued climbing to 16 percent over the next two years, after official tracking ended, meaning more than 841,000 borrowers were in default. Nearly as many were severely delinquent or not repaying their loans (for reasons besides going back to school or being in the military). The share of students facing serious struggles rose to 30 percent over all. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, as you mentioned, higher education raises earning potential significantly, but significant amounts of students fail to graduate, and thus don't see this increase in earning potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at table 2 in this article: 

 [https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-looming-student-loan-default-crisis-is-worse-than-we-thought/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-looming-student-loan-default-crisis-is-worse-than-we-thought/) 

&amp;#x200B;

The groups with the highest default rate are those who didn't get a bachelors or associates degrees."
Why is it significant to say corporate taxes are passed on to consumers? Aren't all taxes effectively passed on to another party?,"It really boils down to context: What are you trying to do?

You've intuitively come up with what economists call the [Circular Flow Model](https://www.stlouisfed.org/education/economic-lowdown-video-series/episode-6-circular-flow): Money flows from business to households in exchange for labor, and then it flows back from households to businesses in exchange for goods and services. In this context, taxes are just a subset of the overall flow: Households and businesses pay taxes, and in exchange they receive goods and services like roads and national defense. The overall volume of the flow doesn't really change, just some details of where parts of it are going. Your context is the whole economy.

However, in the context of trying to help a specific group, who ultimately pays that tax does matter. If your tax costs the people you're trying to help more than it helps them, that's a problem. 

Here's a simplified example: You're trying to help poor people, so you tax Walmart $1 Billion and give it to poor people. Assume that Walmart passes 100% of that cost on to its consumers. At simplest, you're net neutral because the poor people shopping at Walmart have their higher costs exactly balanced out by the government payment. But, there are a couple obvious variables: Walmart might eat some of that tax and only pass on, say, $700 Million. Then your poor people actually end up ahead by $300 Million, which is good. Then again, it's going to cost money to run the program, so maybe the government only passes on $800 Million, that reduces the poor peoples' income increase. So, if Walmart passes on the entire $1 Billion, you've actually reduced your poor peoples' income by $200 Million. 

That's the context people are talking about when they bring up tax incidence, or how much of a tax businesses pass on to employees or customers."
What would happen if Biden canceled federal student loan debt?,"There are different forms of debt.  If the loans are through the federal government, then canceling the debt payments would increase the overall national debt. The effects of increasing the national debt are ambiguous, it's not certain if this particular facet would cause ill will, but it's obviously something to consider if it means potentially raising taxes in the future to help offset the accrued debt.  The effect on the private market for loans is different and will probably have larger consequences for the issuers of the loans. Let's say you loan out 100,000 and simply just do not get it back. How would that effect your expenditures? (EDIT:  just now seeing your post specifically referred to federal student loan debt).

It would create a different political economy regarding those who held the debt:  I just paid off my loans last year, but if I didn't pay at all, I would have been just as fine, if not better off?  What about me?  What about people who are planning on going to college?  A one-time cancel creates uncertainty in this market.  Should people expect debt relief/debt cancelation further on?  Could this create a ""moral hazard"" for future student loan debt?

Further on the political economy:  canceling debt will undoubtedly benefit the upper class students more than it will lower class students. The largest debt holders are by those who are likely to pay off the debt that they accrued through their life time earnings. Think of doctors and lawyers.  The holders of these debts will undoubtedly be better off than those who went to school for a liberal arts degree for 1/3 - 1/5 of the cost of the degree.  So if the goal of this policy is to lessen wealth inequality, it becomes somewhat ambiguous on your intended effects.

The overall macroeconomy would have a short-term boost in spending, assuming that all $ that was being spent on debt is instead spent on other services.  This effect would probably be mild, especially if you raise the question ""what economic policy could we have done with that accrued debt instead of canceling all student loans?"" i.e., the opportunity cost of the accrued national debt."
63% of millennial homeowners regret buying home: survey,"&gt; For millennials, the $1.5 trillion student loan debt crisis is preventing nearly three-quarters of millennials from hitting major milestones, like getting married or having children.

Only 36% of millennials are college graduates. How can 75% of millennials be missing major milestones because of student debt? 

Because the problem for millennials , both with and without college degrees, is really [underemployment](https://link.medium.com/5OAQ7zS5GU). 

*edit* Lots of people do get student loans and don’t graduate - 6 year matriculation is 59% on average. But that still doesn’t bring us close to 75% percent of all millennials. A second variable is that not all students get loans - something like 70% do. 

I’m not trying to argue that student loans are not a crisis, they are. But they are not the only problem millennials face. "
I am a father who just won sole custody of my 5 year old son. Please help.,"I grew up on or below the poverty line most of my life,but i'm pretty young(21) so I can't offer parent specific suggestions or advice. If it's of any use to you,here's a few things i've learned to ease the financial burden on both yourself and your child:

Buy certain things in bulk that will bring yearly costs down and always look for the best prices possible.

-Rice and Pinto beans go for $10 per 20lb bag at walmart
-Rolled oats are cheapest in bulk at Honeyville's website. I buy the 50lb bag for about $60 and it lasts me a little over a year(you can easily change the flavor with fruit preserves so he doesnt get tired of oatmeal every morning)
-Eggs are insanely cheap at other stores,but you can get a pack of 60 at walmart for $10 I think.
-Angel Soft Toilet paper in the 36/72 roll packs at walmart
-This is the best time of year to get whole turkey's for dirt cheap! Cook them in the oven,break them down and put them in sandwich bags to freeze(squeeze the air out to keep frostburn away and allow more meat packed into one area)

I would recommend you go the fresh vegetable/fruit route since canned stuff is not as good for you and its way more expensive(also check prices everywhere so you can find the best deal).

As much shame as people tend to put on it,the goodwill/playdos closet/etc are great for school clothes

Check out any and all government assistance programs to see if you qualify for anything. Any and all help is welcomed.

Check out food banks and churches for food/clothes (doesnt matter if you dont share their faith. They are helping because its what their god wants,regardless of your beliefs)

Boys and girls clubs sometimes help the community and take kids out to shop for shoes/clothes

Go for child support if you can

Ask family for small donations if possible(an extra $5 or $10 every month is a new pair of shoes for your kid every 6 months if need be)

Ask for a raise. Worst case scenario is they say no,right?

Hug your kid,tell them you love them and wish them sweet dreams every night.(if you work a lot,this kind of thing matters even more)

This one is controversial,but I say be completely open and honest with your kid about your finances. 
My mom told me outright that we cant afford (whatever I wanted) because the power bill was too high,or we just dont have enough money. Because of her open attitude towards our finances I ended up with a pretty great skill set for budgeting and saving money at a very early age. I also appreciate everything I have and my gratitude for gifts is almost overboard. I take care of everything I have and I am eternally grateful to my mom for letting me see the reality of the situation from the getgo."
Why aren't there more successes in this field? *Rant*,"IMHO, the Venn diagram of successful quants and r/altotrading members has very little overlap. Most of the guys at T1 quant / prop shops that kill it are not spending time tutoring beginners here or sharing their secrets.

Edit: To answer your other questions, yes I agree that it’s hard to generate real alpha. 

Generally speaking alpha / edge comes from data (‘better’ statistical analysis) or speed (finding ‘true’ arbitrage opportunities and nailing them in ms / ns). Most people (and institutions) don’t have the speed necessary for that form of arbitrage so they default to using information / analytics to generate alpha. This poses a challenge as analyzing the ‘average behavior’ of a stock / the market doesn’t really tell you much about what it will do on any individual day; Saying that the price of Apple will be P0 + avg daily return in the last year will get you close guess but has nothing to actually do with if APPL will be -1%, +1.3% or whatever. 

Another primary issue is that financial market data displays a high amount of ‘noise’, compounded by the fact that nearly all statistics done on financial markets are inferential (something that too many people don’t realize). Basically we can’t observe the true trend / distribution of many parts of financial data making accurate analysis extremely difficult. 

Let me know if you have any other questions OP and I’ll (try to) answer them."
"If apes own the float multiple times over as assumed, why does DRSing take so long? Bye bye karma, but genuine question.","It’s not that easy. Some points to consider:

• 1. Superstonk community is only a fraction of the worldwide GME owners (most certainly though with the highest avrg. shares/investor) 

• 2. Superstonk community is partly Bots + US Investors + Other countries 
- Only the US investors have it seemingly „easy“ to DRS 

- Only a fraction of the US investors choose to do so for various reasons 
- As an EU ape myself, I and many others are waiting for their Computershare accounts since October (very slow process overall) 
- Therefore many choose to DRS 1 share and transfer their positions from their EU brokers afterwards 

In my personal opinion, even smaller EU countries could own the float on their own. But that simply doesn’t show in the DRS‘d numbers.

But let me tell you - this is actually GOOD. Because eventually the individual investors of this community who choose to DRS and are dedicated to OWN their shares will own the float. And that’s what’s actually important ! - not some random paperhands who are in for a quick buck. We will get there eventually and then it’s a core group of dedicated individuals owning the float. IMO this is worth much more than more random accounts.

Edit: grammar

Berkshire's annual meeting - A few takeaways that won't make headlines,"His actions speak louder than his words. He wasn't complaining about high valuations and few opportunities this time. A lot of buying--he spent 27% of his cash in a few weeks. Not just OXY and Allegheny, but also Activision, Apple, Chevron, HP, etc. The Activision arbitrage play is rather unusual for him, and he took full responsibility for it. 

The Apple purchase is particularly interesting to me, because last year he sold a bit at the top, to the dismay of Munger. There were a few days in 2022 where it dipped into his buy zone, which looks like around $150-$160, and he said he would've bought more if it hadn't rebounded. That gives us a sense of his view of the intrinsic value of Apple, and where it's no longer a buy, which is information that is hard to get from him. 

My guess is that one of the reasons he wasn't talking so much about investments this time is because he's looking for deals, and doesn't want to give away too much information."

Why is Africa so much poorer than Europe?,"A popular one now, particularly from economists like Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, is institutions where colonialism plays a somewhat indirect role. At its simplest Africa is poor because of extractive institutions that have suppressed free enterprise and liberty that were put in place during the colonial period. While Europe has had more ""open"" institutions.

A somewhat less popular idea now is that of geography, put forward by Jeff Sachs and Jared Diamond, is of unique geographical starting positions that made it more or less difficult for certain societies to flourish early on and over time sharp inequalities emerged.

Culture is also a rather popular explanation, like from Deirdre McCloskey and Joely Mokyr, in that western societies had cultural traits built over centuries fostered in part from Protestantism or other sources that encouraged education, trust, etc that encouraged innovation and free enterprise.

Ethnic Fragmentation in Africa, William Easterly and Paul Collier has interesting work on this, has resulted in less conceive centralized states where conflict over competing interests has often been ripe.

...And there are a lot of others. A lot of interesting recent work in econ has focused on history and its persistent influence into today like from Mellisa Dell or Natahn Nunn. A lot of good work, i think synthesises, to some extent a lot of the popular explanatons e.g. it seems likely culture institutions and geography are likely interderpent in some way."
Why is Africa so much poorer than Europe?,"Colonialism certainly served as a hinderance to economic growth in the region. Large sections of the region were broken up into states with little regard to tribal differences, seeding the potential for internal conflict in the long run. Conflict is rarely ever beneficial to long run economic growth.

To go further, many African nations are landlocked, and there are few waterways running through the area. This obviously limits such nations’ ability to trade. Africa also struggles with widespread diseases like malaria, making it all the more difficult to build human capital.

All of this being said, it is important to remember each nation in Africa is different, and thus have their own unique problems. Some are also richer while others are poorer.

What are some ways to earn some crypto (2$ for example) daily?,"Depends, while doing nothing? Mh not sure.

But playing games like Axie Infinity can make you easily 100-400$ per month if you play a bit, sadly it takes some money to start off or you need to play someone else's account and take a 65% share and he as the owner gains 35% (usual rate), then there is stuff like Odysee (a website like YouTube) where you can collect daily rewards for watching a single video. Even tho it's not much (0,2-100, I often get 1 and sometimes got 8) and it's at $0,2 atm so why not for a single click (You don't even need to watch the video) and maybe it will increase in value at some point."
"Elliot Waves and GME, Why I'm Jacked To Infinity With Today's 82 Point Drop 🚀","I did a completely different analysis on a log scale - basically just comparing the January run up proportionally to what could happen in the coming days before we broke through $200 couple weeks ago.

Basically my bottom for this dip was around $220 which is confirmed by your much more in depth analysis and today’s price action and I too believe in the coming days / weeks we gonna see a run up to high $500s - $586 if you say so. After that I see a small retrace before we could reach $5k - $6k. Not saying that’s MOASS, that’s just the run up that will initiate the MOASS.

[ETH Daily Discussion] - 30/May/2017,"Some thoughts and observations:

...

- To make money in cryptocurrency **it is about understanding the probability of a percentage return relative to another purchase** not about how many units you own.

- There are lots of metrics used to evaluate a cryptocurrency/token but basically ETH is a unicorn investment due to the rate and scale of adoption + the potential massive breadth of applications that go well beyond traditional banking.

- A friend of mine used the exact same mentality you did to avoid buying ETH due to its spot price at $10, $20, $50, $100; wound up day trading junk penny tokens at a massive loss.

- **Result: my portfolio is worth 15x his in the same timeframe.**

- He finally entered ETH at $170 after explaining this concept for the 3rd or 4th time. His percentage return on ETH may well wind up lower than mine.

Look at fundamentals. This guide helps:

- /r/Particl/comments/696t2q/the_intelligent_investors_guide_to_cryptocurrency/

...

- I would be very careful of shorting ETH or playing dips right now because in a bull market this big, things tend to FOMO and self perpetuate very quickly (especially since evidence suggests an influx of new traders/investors).

- Over the weekend we saw relatively low trading volume and bearish technical indicators in a 1 week period but TA's greatest weakness is the inherent assumption that there are no artificial restrictions on buy or sell demand.

- This was why I was super reluctant and instinctually (although barely) against selling on the bounce from $110 to $160 until the bank holiday weekend was over in spite of the chart trajectory looking bearish at that time.

...

- I'm starting to think we're hitting a new exponent phase of growth here so I would wait for clear evidence of a prolonged consolidatory phase before relying on TA to determine bull/bear activity for day trading or before considering a significant swing trade.

- Personally intra-day trading in a bull market is much harder than trading a bear market; in a bear market you always ultimately win through holding fiat; in a bull you'll win through holding it."
Buying and owning an apartment in Berlin,"There are probably several reasons for the apartment purchases you observe. 
Whether it makes sense for you? Here are a few things to consider: 

- It is often the thought of paying off a loan and thereby gaining property rather than spending money on rent and thereby paying off or increasing someone else's property that makes people consider buying. This thought can make sense if, for example, rents are high and similar to or exceed a loan payment. There are good YouTube videos on the subject of ""renting or buying"", look into the topic and compare the numbers. 
You should keep in mind that interest and maintenance costs are  sometimes forgotten in calculations! There are formulas how to calculate whether a purchase makes sense. 

However, with interest rates currently rising, demand is likely to fall again in the near future. 2 years ago it was 0.5% which was of course way better than today. 
People are still buying despite high interest rates because they want to secure property and because they think prices will rise even more (if you compare prices of Berlin to other capitals, Berlin was cheap! It still is among the cheaper ones. Therefore Berlin was, and maybe still is, interesting for real estate Investments). Many people who did not buy in the last 10 years will maybe never be able anymore, and this is an anxiety based on which other people are buying even though it means to take huge loans… always calculate numbers before acting out of emotions though 

- To live in the property also secures the place of residence, since no one can terminate you because of Eigenbedarf or otherwise.

- An important point is that in the last 10 years the real estate prices have risen very much. If you bought an apartment in one of the top cities like Berlin a few years ago, the value often doubled. Many have therefore earned better from real estate than from ETFs and other investment strategies. This has created a buying mentality that fuels purchases in addition to sentimental or cultural thoughts (life goal of buying a house or apartment, something ""of one's own""). However, many are currently saying that this price increase is probably over for the time being, many expect stagnation at a high level. It is unclear what the future will bring. You are entering speculation. 

- Picking up on the point above: Real estate is also an investment strategy. In addition to the appreciation, it is 1) a relatively stable investment opportunity and 2) they yield returns. A return of 3% is considered good. You can find the formula for calculating it on the Internet. With 700€ monthly (cold rent?) and 300.000 purchase price the yield is 2.8% and thus quite okay. 
The current problem: the purchase prices have grown so exorbitantly, while the rents have not risen to the same extent, that the yields have fallen in percentage terms. This is annoying for all those who buy to invest. 
Probably some are also buying at the moment because they are afraid that prices will rise even more and they won't be able to buy anything in the future. One cannot foresee that. 


However, the overpriced prices from the Internet are not always the real selling prices... Do not be misled. You can place bids and say, ""I'll give them 270,000"" and see what happens. 
It may make sense for you to buy if the property is really good (is it refurbished? Sun exposure? Floor? Elevator? Old or new windows? humidity? LOCATION?) and you get a regular return on future rentals. Value stability or perhaps value increase in Berlin is then also possible. 
Currently, with your low rent, it is probably not worthwhile in terms of numbers. However, you will not live there forever, and can also be terminated. 
A return of 2.8% is okay. Depending on your interest rate and loan the rent might pay it off. 
Diversification of your investments also makes sense.

Personally, I have been in the real estate market for a long time, my family and me have bought several real estates which we would not be able to buy nowadays. The rent we got paid off the loans, and usually there was still rent left to benefit each month. 
We have been very lucky and made a lot of money with it. If that is possible in the current situation… hard to tell. Personally, I watch the market in Berlin very closely and I don’t think that Berlins prices will fall in the future. I have an apartment in Berlin for 300k a few years ago, today it’s worth 750k. 
I am thinking about buying a second one but am quite critical at the moment. The current situation is difficult and does not necessarily invite you to buy, there are many bad overpriced properties on offer.

Anomaly No More ! GME float keeps going up. It's not an anomaly or a glitch. I've contacted Stockanalysis (new source) and others have contacted Yahoo. Waiting for answers.,Started to comment then saw your FUD patrol at the end. That’s EXACTLY what I was thinking - we have a number. It’s a psychological effect called anchoring. This is the first time we’ve seen a large number and it updates. It’s humans cognitive bias to believe this number. We should now believe it’s wayyyyy beyond 250… to the mooonnnnn
I am a zip bull who lost a LOT of money,"I got burned after the GFC. It helped a lot with the covid crash/boom and what my expectations should be. So I managed to make some and then take it out this time. Shit isnt going to be easy from here on so Ive basically sold everything late 2022.

What would happen if everyone refused to pay their debts?,"This would lead to all banks and financial institutions going bankrupt at the same time and wipe out all depositors (in your scenario: that would be everyone).

Large companies that rely on debt to grow and maintain activity would not be able to raise more debt and go out of business.

The government would need to borrow a lot of money (/print through the Fed) to bail out all financial institutions. As this would greatly increase the money supply, you can expect rising inflation and lowering value of the USD against all other currencies.

Most of the issues come from the concept of Fractional Banking which allows financial institutions to lend much much more than their deposits

Melvin's SEC Filing Led Me To the Answer... Why GME at $40 Matters Tomorrow...,"This is incorrect. Puts cannot and are not used to cover shorts, so none of this makes sense, can you please explain how puts can cover a short position? Like actually explain? I highly doubt you'll reply as you are WRONG. 

The price can go below $40 and NOTHING changes so it's not doom and gloom if it goes that low. Firstly Puts and Shorts are two different things. Puts are options, and have an expiration date which you CAN let expire with not costs eg if the contract expires 02/19/21 you can let it expire at no cost. 

A short means you have a contractual obligation, eg you HAVE to buy the share back at some point to give back to the broker. A put is simply a contract stating you CAN sell a share at X price. Eg you buy a Put contract with a strike price of $50, you pay a small amount for that contract, then if the price goes down to say $30 you would buy the stock and exercise your put contract so you can sell it at $50 essentially making $20. But if the price doesn't go down eg actually goes up to say $70 if the expiration date on the contract is the 02/19/21 when that date rolls around you can do nothing, let the contract expire and simply lose the little amount you paid for the contract. 

Call option sellers certainly DID get caught up in the price jump, ffs there's even a guy trying to [sue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/17/gamestop-saga-reddit-trader-roaring-kitty-accused-of-fraud-in-the-latest-wild-lawsuit/?sh=32c55bfd7841) DFV because he sold naked calls (sold call contracts and didn't own the share) then the price rocketed to $430 so those naked call option sellers had to go to the market and buy a shitload of shares at $450 a pop and immediately hand them over to whoever bought the contract from them. No idea why your saying to trust you RE theta gang lmao. 

If anything the higher the price the better (obviously) but if there and naked call contracts among the calls expiring today it will force them to go to market and actually buy the shares (the option sellers that is) to then sell to the person holding the option that has exercised, eg putting more upward pressure on the price. Also your short % doesn't include shorts done through ETF's like XRT so its actually even higher than that. 

Furthermore there is NO public float, more than 100% of the public float is owner by institutions.... hence a volume issue when shorts attempt to cover. Hedge's have been trading back and forth for a while ramping the price down by simply shorting not actually buying and selling real stock just look at the short volume every day....

90-95% of Day Traders Do Not Lose Money and 9 Other Things We Should Stop Saying/Doing,"Even if it is 90% of daytraders lose money (I've also heard it's 80% lose money, 10% are flat, and the remaining 10% make money), getting to the upper 20% takes time and work Just like any competitive video game, job, or w/e.

How do two gas stations coexist on the same street if one always has lower prices.,"Because eventually one of them will hit their break-even and/or they would both hit their break-even.

Also, typically the difference in pricing between gas stations on the same street isn't high enough and/or the lower priced gas doesn't have enough pumps to literally capture all the business of the other gas station."

Do economists have a confirmation bias?,"It sounds like you've been learning about the history of economics and, you feel like economists have to be proven wrong in spectacular fashion before they change their minds about things? I think it makes sense when you look at the past. There is some good evidence that we're in a different place today, though.

Economics has evolved a great deal over the past few decades. [Angrist and Pischke wrote a great article in 2010](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.3) discussing this change and how it has improved the credibility of the field quite a bit. Economists rely far, far more on empirical study and evidence today than they did in prior decades. Theory and theoretical publications are still alive and well, but much fewer economists these days write papers on theory alone. Empirical evidence is hugely important. For empirical economists, findings that challenge the status quo are typically more publishable than findings that confirm what economists already know, so there may be a publication bias towards *disproving* typical assumptions than confirming them.

So, I'd be curious if you have any reason to think that confirmation bias is a big issue in modern economics, rather than historical. This isn't to say modern economics can't be wrong - it certainly can - but my perspective is that, if there's an economist out there who can disprove a common assumption with available information, they will be highly motivated to do so. A top 5 publication and tenure provide lots of incentive."
Where is the global economy headed? Inflation seems incredibly high,"&gt;Globally inflation is high.

.. no. Inflation is a bit higher than usual. That doesn't make it *high*.

In the US it's at 5.4%

https://www.bls.gov/cpi

In Europe it's at 3.4%

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/macroeconomic_and_sectoral/hicp/html/index.en.html

Not really particularly high, especially when you consider that inflation was well below target last year.

&gt;House prices are soaring still.

The tl;dr of that is still ""we have to build more housing in the places where people want to live"". Until that happens, this situation is unlikely to change. Thankfully the solution is, in principle, simple.

"My grandparents have been renting out two-bedroom units for $900 a month in one of the hottest housing markets in the country, but only to working-class people","This is the reason when I seek out new living places, I always seek out private landlords. Even if it takes longer.

Harder, too. One time I called 20 places in a newspaper and kept getting the same office! Finally was like, ""What do you people NOT own. Put your management company on the friggin ad!"" Till I started cruising thru lower income areas and found a ""for rent sign"" where I am now and have been for 8 years.

And I have good reason to..

If things get bad, some private landlords will be MUCH more understanding and not waiting with teams of maintenance people, lawyers, and cops to screw you further if you are even a week late as long as you are a decent human being and don't destroy the place. Nor are they going to raise my rent every friggin year. I have only had one rent increse in 8 years. I pay like 600/ mo for a 2 BR/ 2BA.

In times past, there used to be a ton of these people. Still are, but they don't advertise and rarely have turnover. Because why leave unless you have to move to another city for a job or something?

Unfortunately, private landlords are becoming an endangered species as companies buy stuff up and large investors buy up everything where you are just X in unit 23458 that gets auto-issued rent increases based on an algorithm along with an eviction if you are so much as a week late by that same computer that may not even be in the same state or even country.

Stock split: everyone who has a share in an account goes from 1 -&gt; whatever is agreed … say 5 shares

The former isn’t a big deal to short sellers because there are a bunch of counterfeit shares, and then they just get split up and there are even more counterfeit shares.

The later (dividend) is powerful because GameStop only gives out outstanding shares x distributed dividend shares - meaning they know how many new shares should be going out and technically a short would have to go buy the difference in shares on the market?"

Is it a bad idea to use ROTH IRA money for a home down payment?,"Just so you (really your finacee) are clear: the money previously put in as Roth contributions can *always* be withdrawn without tax or penalty, for any reason.  Any withdrawal made is treated as first coming from those past contributions.  If fiancee has put &gt;$10k into a Roth IRA over the past years, they can take $10k out and just go gamble it in Vegas (note: don't do this) and the IRS won't want a penny of it.

The ""earnings"" (what's in it now on top of original contributions) come out after using up all the contributions, and these **do** require meeting some criteria to come out without penalty or tax.  Being older than 59.5 is the primary criteria, but not the only one.  Up to $10k of earnings can be taken out and will not incur the normal 10% penalty if it's used for a first time home purchase.  Separately, a Roth IRA in finacee's name (doesn't have to be this specific one) has to be older than 5 years, otherwise the removed earnings get treated as taxable income (even if no penalty).

That doesn't change much about the decision to withdraw from the IRA or not, but figured a more accurate understanding of the cost of that withdrawal could be helpful.

&gt;is the $10,000 setback really a setback in the grand scheme of things?

Here's one way to look at things.  Assuming you're in your 20s, that $10k has about 40 years to grow.  Under common assumptions, at retirement that represents a potential future balance of about $100k in todays dollars.  It'll likely be a different amount of dollars in the 2060s, but would spend like $100k does today.

How big of a setback would you consider ""retired you"" having $100k less in their retirement account?  A common recommendation is to use a 4% ""safe withdrawal rate"" from your retirement accounts to live off of, so that reduced balance means effectively a $4k / year cut in safe spending.

Buying a house is a big thing, and uncertainty in the current market does not help.  Unless you come across a property that's *perfect*, and $10k is the only thing between getting that (and eternal happiness) or not, then maybe tapping the IRA might be a viable option."
What are your thoughts on large firms buying real estate at above asking?,"It makes me a little nervous. It makes me worried for my kids to be able to buy a house in the future. And my tin foil hat says maybe they’ll push for laws to get rid of individual landlords. On the plus side, I do think it’s possible for values to go much higher. Maybe this is their hedge against a stock market crash or a commercial real estate loan crash - but these are complete guesses as the stock market is not my expertise."
UNPOPULAR OPINION - we should stop telling young people to choose jobs they love and tell them to choose jobs that will allow them to love their life.,"Ah, the old ‘useless degrees’ tripe. There are useless deadshits and outstanding employable graduates from
ALL degrees, mate.

How many interpreters, public sector employees, social workers, teachers and politicians have a Bachelor of Arts? Lots.

How many people in the mining industry, technical industries, laboratories and council environmental and waste management departments have a bachelor of science? Loads.

Undergraduate psychology students are informed outright that they cannot practice without the masters degree, but plenty of people take a psychology degree and end up in game and educational development and design, school guidance office, Human Resources, large sporting clinics and training centres, and the ABS (because psychology graduates have a lot of good statistical capabilities).

The key to getting the most out of any degree is building connections, having exposure to a range of potential future employment pathways that you could never have imagined being relevant to you, learning to communicate effectively, and leading with your strengths. Most employers couldn’t give a shit what degree you have, as long as you can show how it is relevant to their position.

And just like the rest of society, university graduates are varying degrees of excellent to terrible at communicating their skill set to others."
Is the rise of dual income households related to why everything is so expensive these days?,"**Short answer: No.**

**Long answer:**

First, we must clearly separate two things:

* Income
* Prices (and the concept of ""price level"")

Your question is solely about *prices* and not only prices, about prices *in general.*

That's why of the approved answers, RobThorpe's is the most appropriate one: In America, the Federal Reserve is in charge of keeping inflation (rise in the general price level) at check at 2% yearly, which is seen as predictable and small.

But I was thinking about your argument, and it made me realize that what you're asking is simple and could be rephrased as an Econ 101 question:

&gt;""What would be the effect in prices when households experience a positive shock to their income by allowing women to work?""

To answer this question, we cannot think about the general price level, because many if not most goods and services are bought by people as individuals, not by the household as one.

However, we can answer this question if we limit ourselves to those products which are bought by households as one: Houses, home appliances, etc..

Then, we must subdivide those products:

* Inferior goods: Goods whose demand diminishes when income rises.
* Normal goods: Goods whose demand rises when income rises.
   * Luxury goods: Goods whose demand rises *more than proportionally* when income rises.

For the **normal** goods, the intuition of OP is right:

According to Econ 101, a ""positive shock to income"" raises demand and, therefore, raises both the price *and the quantity consumed*. That means that we should expect women's entry into the workforce to allow people to buy or rent more of these things, which would in turn make them more expensive.

But when it comes to **inferior** goods, the opposite happens:

An inferior good is what you buy when you don't have enough money to get what you really want, like perhaps gas ovens, which are very popular in my country (not America) but maybe aren't as popular in America. Women's entry into the workforce might have pushed households away from gas ovens and into electric ones, and *ceteris paribus* make gas ovens cheaper.

I'm talking about hypotheticals because I really don't know which of these products are ""normal"" and which are   
""inferior"". Technically, we could make a list of all the goods that are bought by households and measure the income elasticity of demand, but who has time for that.

Anyways, the point is that this doesn't matter because:

1. Many if not most goods are bought by individuals, not by households.
2. As u/zzzzz94 said, real income has risen on average in America, even before Women's entry into the workforce.

So it's really unfeasible that it would've had an effect on the average price level.

Finally, an answer to your other question:

&gt;Is that why Boomers are looked at as doing so well, because...

No.

Boomers *are* doing better than younger people *now* because of what it's called the *life-cycle* of income: People's income changes according to their age, and older people tend to make more money than their younger cohorts.

In real terms, ""boomers"" didn't have more income *when they were young* than young people have now.

Educational requirements for getting hired are higher than they were for boomers, but so is educational attainment. Employers are requiring more and more degrees, but young people are actually getting those degrees. As a result, real income have risen above what boomers were making when they were young."
Let us please have a non wheel/csp/cc strategy pow-wow,"I sell \~20 delta strangles at 40-50 DTE and hold until 50% profit, which is normally after about 25ish days. I've never held a position even close to expiration. The most I've held to is \~15 DTE. I like this strategy for multiple reasons:

\- I'm in my 40s and looking to retire from my day job(software engineer). I've determined that I don't need anymore than $70-100k a year, anything beyond that is just gravy. I make more than that now working but I'm seeking freedom, not wealth. I want a strategy where I don't have to watch the markets all day. I've tried to tell friends and family what I do but they just think I'm day trading. Far from it. I close/open positions every other week or so

\- It's the best way to collect theta. I started off with spreads but noticed that long leg eats away all your theta. It takes getting used to having ""naked"" positions but that's why I never hold anything close to expiry. Just keep track of your trades(this could literally be like once or twice a day) to make sure an underlying didn't take a rapid turn. If it does then you always have the opposite leg of your trade to adjust. Roll out, roll up/down, you'll always have something you can do. Even if a leg goes ITM you can still profit. Right now I have positions on PYPL and IWM that I've adjusted into straddles, and they're both ITM, and the trades are still in the green.

\- You get to define the exact delta you want. Bullish on the stock? Make that put 25 delta and the call 10 delta. Bearish? Do the opposite. The key to collecting theta is to hedge out delta and vega as much as possible. Selling strangles is like having a moving goalpost. Just give yourself enough of a cushion with time(i.e. close well before expiration) and you'll always score.

\- I want a strategy that works in bear markets as well as bull. Of course bulls markets are better for every strategy but this has been backtested to work even when prices are dropping for a long time. As long as you understand IV you'll be good to go."

Why is the credit score system such a scam?,"The number of open accounts you have affects your credit score, and the older those accounts are, the better. So when you paid off your car, they closed your 4-5 year old account, and that's probably what lowered your score.

It's happened to a lot of people. Me included.

Yeah, it's fair to say that your credit score helps lenders figure out how profitable you'll be to them. And it doesn't always make sense to us why our scores go up and down, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a scam.

Sometimes, you really need to borrow money, and they legitimately want to know if you're likely to pay them back. Credit scores are a way to do that.

I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about my credit score though. My idea is just to manage my money well and if my score drops a few points every now and again, so be it."

Why has Japan not experienced high inflation?,"Japan has been different in regards to inflation for a few decades. In particular, they spent most of the early 2000s with overall deflation. Only in the last 5-10 years had Japan reversed that to make have inflation instead of deflation. While the QE could increase the inflation in Japan (or America), with the pre-COVID rates as low as they have been, and central bank's ability to counteract rising inflation if it gets to high, the risk of large inflation is relatively low in these countries. With that said, I'm not a macroeconomist or an international economist, so I could be slightly incorrect on this answer."
Is now a good time to invest in a restaurant?,"I can share some experience here since it seems like so far you've been mostly getting the ""restaurants are a money pit"" sort of advice (spoiler: that's basically going to be my advice for you as well, but with more reasoning and some examples laid out).

I own two successful restaurants and am opening a third this spring. Each one nets me about $360,000/year as an owner/operator, 2020-2021 not included and both were big losses.

A few things stand out to me about what you're considering that make me think this is a bad set up. Restaurants can be successful and when they are they can make a lot of money if you have the right business model, but business model is extremely important. A lot of concepts are set up to fail from day 1.

First thing that stands out is that they think now is a good time due to depressed rents. Restaurants are not like other brick and mortar retail concepts. Restaurants are very high cash flow. Rent is rarely a factor if you've built your business model correctly.

Using some real numbers. Both of my restaurants pay about 8K per month in rent. Both of my restaurants generate $180,000/month in gross revenue. If you can't allocate &lt;5% of your revenue for rent you have bigger issues, and if you are looking at more than 5% of your projected revenue for rent you should be very careful with your other numbers and really value the location. 

Almost all of your expenses will come from food cost and labor costs. While other expenses matter and do add up, these are the two things that REALLY matter and will make or break your restaurant. Saving on rent is almost inconsequential.

We hit around 45% in labor costs and about 25% in food costs. This is in a high cost of living area with a $$-$$$ish restaurant. $60-80pp. As other as said these are not decreasing but increasing rapidly and you need to have a plan. We pay higher than market and offer full benefits with healhcare/pto/flexible schedules,401K matching/etc. Me and my business partner are both chefs and we both work on the line 40ish hrs/week. Even then we have a hard time staffing and the biggest hurdle in the new location next year is finding a way to staff it. Our dishwasher/bussers makes $22 + tips and benefits. around 60K/year total and it only goes up from there, but it's still incredibly difficult to staff. We've raised prices to accommodate for raising wages and food prices, but we're in a metro area (bay area) where people have not had any issues meeting them. You need to do demographic research to determine if your proposed location can support the prices you need to put on your menu.

Construction is also very expensive right now. I spent around $400,000 to open my first restaurant with the help of an SBA loan and a lot of credit cards. My current restaurant is looking to cost around 900K for a similar size and scope. it's doubled since 2015 when i opened my first one. All of this is basically to show that thinking your savings in rent will matter at all in the scope of a restaurant business, is not a good way to conceptualize your expenses. Even if you get a steal and get a spot for like 40% cheaper than it would have been in 2019, you're looking at the difference of max 5K/month. Maybe 8 or 9K for a larger (riskier) space. It really won't help you if the rest of your business doesn't pencil out. If you had the hookup of landing an amazing head chef, or you yourself work in supply chain and know how to source great quality affordable produce or something, you'd be closer to an opportunity moment than a depression in retail rent.

The second thing I see is that you're chatting with 4 friends. Does this include you? I own 80% of my business and the only equity I've given up is 20% to my long time colleague and business partner who is also employed by the company as an executive chef. If you have 5 ""investors"" in the restaurant vs operators even in the best case scenario of making a few hundred thousand per year profits will be eaten up by having to hire more people than in my examples since presumably you aren't working there as a managing chef. Profits will then be split down to something that may be profitable, but certainly not worth the time you'll need to invest to make the restaurant work. Like do you want to work an extra 20-40/hr week for maybe 30K at the end of the year on top of your day job?

Restaurants are my day job, and I started working in them when I was 15. I didn't open my first restaurant until I had close to 20 years of experience working pretty much every position. Even now I often am working odd jobs at the restaurant, yesterday I went from a meeting with our GC at the new location to at meeting at our accountant's offices downtown to a dishwashing shift that night at our original location to fill in for someone taking time off to go to a wedding. Do any of your business partners have that level of experience or willingness? And if they do are they going to be resentful if they split the equity down so far for passive investors like yourself? That will lead to quick burnout.

Don't let people fully turn you off on owning a restaurant if that's someone you want to do. It can work. It works for me, but only because it is my day job and I have decades of experience in what works and what doesn't. And the money I make makes the long hours more than worth it. 

I definitely recommend working in a restaurant for at least 2-3 years before investing in one. The way you describe this project has a lot of red flags and make it sound like nobody knows what they're doing."

Top 12 Cryptocurrencies Ranked by Risk-Adjusted Return,"This somewhat questionable.

First, the writer points us to a linear chart (see the link Comparison of Bitcoin to Past Bubbles), which is improper and misleading. It should be logarithmic. An increase of investment property from 1 to 2 is exactly equivalent to an increase from 10 to 20 or 100 to 200, because the ROI is the same in all three cases.

The S&amp;P500 is more heavily weighted towards growth and tech stocks than ever before, so the index as a whole has higher P/E. Besides, with investing now being more accessible to retail investors than ever before, you likely have to pay a price premium on a lot of stocks.

"13k cash, 8k debt. What would you do?","The smartest thing to do right now is pay off that entire debt completely - you now have a good emergency cash buffer.

Every month you pay interest on that loan actually reduces your savings - your savings rate is &lt;1%, while the interest you pay is 12%, so instead of gaining £1 on £100 by saving it, you're losing £12 by not paying that debt.

Buying a house should not be your priority right now - paying off that loan is. Pay it all off in full, and put away what you would've paid in repayments - in the long run you'll end up saving more. i.e. instead of saving £500 per month, you'll save £800 per month if you save your loan repayments from now on too.

Is it true that rich countries are rich because they exploit developing countries,"If that was how it worked, then you would expect there to be a linear relationship between income levels and manufacturing as a percentage of GDP, that isn't true.

The countries with the highest manufacturing share of their GDP are middle income countries. [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?most\_recent\_value\_desc=false](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=false) You also would not expect any countries to get rich exporting fossil fuels, since those are resources, not manufactured goods. So you wouldn't expect Norway and Qatar to be so rich. So there are some pretty obvious problems with that idea. When I took a human geography class, they taught us that people used to believe that: That rich countries were rich because they manufactured goods and sold them to poor countries, and poor countries were poor because they sold raw resources to rich countries and bought manufactured goods from them. So the way to get rich is to sever ties with rich countries and protect and develop your own manufacturing sector. Its called the dependency theory. [https://www.britannica.com/topic/dependency-theory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dependency-theory) But attempts to implement that theory failed. The countries that tried it went bankrupt. So, the idea that poor countries are poor because they don't manufacture and rich countries are rich because they do manufacture is vestigial."

Why are the highest paying jobs often the most demanding in terms of time?,"There are two competing forces for determining how someone responds to an increase in their wage.

Chwy 1700 P/E; is this not absurd?,"I think they posted something like $0.02 in earnings. When the denominator of PE is so close to 0 it can create some absurd numbers. While I’m not advocating for this stock, I don’t think PE is necessarily the best measure of assessing its value."

The senior notes were paid off.

There is no bear thesis, except for possibly less interest in crypto/NFTs/metaverse.  Yet, looking at all the estimates in growth and value, it's not a good bear thesis."
Is running Zomato Cloud Kitchens a sound investment/revenue generating idea?,"Some time ago before the whole pandemic and all I did some initial research into setting up a cloud kitchen and based on the conversations I had with restaurateurs the sense I got was 

1. Staffing issue is a nightmare, cooks will jump for a few thousand Rs more without even informing you and you will be left scrambling on that day or for a few days till you can find another cook. And that can lead to quality issues if you have not standardized the process. (Make of this what you will, I am not sure if it is a HR problem i.e. if management mistreats employees or if there is some other reason)
2. Extreme competition, every one that wants to start a business and does not know what else to do starts a restaurant. 
3. Swiggy and Zomato charges are pretty high. But customers prefer it even if you do home delivery with your own staff. This might be solvable with your own app but you will have to make it as convenient as Swiggy in terms of setting your location and picking items from the menu and that adds a tech overhead to your already tight margins.  

Those are the major problems that I remember people talking about off the top of my head. I am sure there were a lot more.

This is my opinion based on the conversation I had with people. But the way to solve that is 

1. Open a single item kitchen rather than trying to do a 100 item restaurant. Like a lot of restaurants are doing with biryani. But maybe try other food items.
2. Get into a restaurant related industry, so if staffing is an issue, do staffing for restaurants. Or better yet a lot of restaurants do not have their own app/website and online marketing. So build a product around that and as soon as they sign up with you, they get an app with their menu, a photographer comes to take beautiful real food pics(think McDonalds style) and you also do online reputation management. Like I do not see a lot of small restaurants in India defending themselves or selling themselves on the review forums like Zomato, tripadvisor etc. So you can build an outsourced service/product around that. Instead of getting directly into the restaurant business. That would make it a tech play rather than a food play which will make it easier to attract investors and easier to reach profitability and scale."
They are selling millions of shares from ETFs that’s why it’s dipping,"This sounds like an insanely complicated and convoluted way to short just a single target stock. But... If they couldn't get their hands on any more shares to short... Then shorting the ETFs does give them more firepower. It's rather ingenious if true. But, we're getting back into the 'too big to fail' situation. They keep doubling down. So, the system will protect itself to preserve the status quo. Expect more schenegians."
“The definition of “rich” is having passive income greater than your burn.”,"I feel like we are conflating ""rich"" and ""financially independent"".

How did Venezuela hid Hyper-Inflation in the first place and is US on the same path?,"&gt;But anyone with more than 2 braincells would know that printing money will cause the money to lose value unless it is balanced with equal capital generation. So what exactly prompted the Venezuelans to print money like no tomorrow?

By being really dumb and incompetent. Of course you ""should"" know exactly what's happening. Venezuela on the other hand has hired people that don't believe in inflation and don't believe that printing money causes prices to go up.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKBN0UL27820160107

&gt;Now I fear that this may also prompt US government to print money like no tomorrow, like it did in 2020 to combat COVID-19. Printing 30% of your entire money in circulation obviously will cause massive inflation, and I don't want to end up like Venezuela.

Monetary policy in a country like the US is fundamentally different of monetary policy in a country like Venezuela. Why? Look at Venezuela.

Venezuela allows monetary policy to become entangled in fiscal policy. Or in other words, they print money with the goal of financing government spending. Although at times events of substantial deficits as well as substantial money creation might coincide (like during the pandemic), the US doesn't do this. In fact, it's illegal for the fed to buy government bonds to finance government spending. And it doesn't want to, either, because we have a very good idea how countries that do that turn out.

The fed only expands the money supply if the economic situation warrants it, usually if there is substantial deflationary pressure (as it was during the pandemic). It's not going to start the presses just because the government needs cash.

&gt;Lastly, why can't countries keep the currency fixed? Why is it that what costed $1.00 in 1976 now costs me $5.07 in 2021? Why can't the government keep the price at $1? I.e. 0% inflation? Is it because we all gave up on gold standard?

Well, most modern economies do try to keep it fixed, they just keep it fixed at a specific rate of inflation that isn't zero. So the answer is, because central banks don't want to. Because zero is not an ideal rate of inflation.

What to expect 6/9 at the shareholder's meeting,"They will know the final voting numbers at the meeting, because the inspector of elections tallies them immediately prior. Remember, the purpose of the meeting is for shareholders to cast their votes on the matters at hand, they cannot declare the motions passed without having the votes tallied. 

The reporting requirement is that the voting results need to be reported within 4 business days, but this isn’t like a political election where you’re waiting for polls to be counted over days. They’ll have the final numbers there.

SOURCE: Am a corporate lawyer ape with extensive experience with public company shareholder meetings.

EDIT: Just saw u/punkyrus Edit 3 - to be clear, I’m saying that the company will know at the meeting. Typically the CEO leads the meeting and will read a script going through the formalities of the meeting. In that script which the CEO reads, he typically states that Computershare has advised that x number of shares voted in favour of the resolution (note that this could be the final figure that was already “corrected” by Computershare). For the formal announcement of voting results, including number of votes, we would expect to see it in a press release or 8-k filing no more than 4 business days after the meeting."

"David Graeber outlined our abundance of ""bullshit jobs""; how do we fix this problem?","The basis for the question is flawed because Graeber's book is pseudoscience. It's just his subjective social observations and ""\[d\]espite generating clear testable hypotheses, the theory is not based on robust empirical research.""  As that [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09500170211015067) testing Graeber's theory points out, ""The proportion of employees describing their jobs as useless is low and declining and bears little relationship to Graeber’s predictions."" See this thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/omgcb3/how_large_is_the_effect_of_bullsht_jobs_jobs_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for additional discussion of some of the flaws with his ""methodology"" and links to other empirical research refuting his thesis.  

To use a concrete example I'm familiar with, corporate compliance officers are not ""bullshit jobs.""  Banks need compliance officers to ensure they're complying with financial regulations, construction companies need someone to ensure they're complying with environmental regulations and building codes, and just about every company needs someone to ensure they're complying with labor regulations.  As long as companies are subject to complex regulatory schemes, they need people to make sure they comply with the regulations so they aren't subject to hefty penalties and fines.  If you wanted to eliminate those ""bullshit jobs,"" you could get rid of the regulations, and there are people who would argue that's a good idea.  But the point of the regulations isn't to add directly to a firm's productivity; they're supposed to be serving a larger social purpose, like environmental protection.  So saying that corporate compliance officers don't add to a firm's productivity is entirely missing the point of the job.

Some of the other jobs on the list show a condescending attitude toward certain professions.  The idea that receptionists and administrative assistants are there ""to make their superiors feel important"" is demeaning and demonstrates a total lack of understanding of what those people actually do.  In the end, Graeber's book has no real empirical basis and is mostly just his social commentary about what jobs he thinks are useful and why. As Graeber acknowledged his original essay on the topic, there are plenty of people who would think his job as an anthropology professor was a  ""bullshit job"" with no productive value.  That kind of subjective assessment of what is or is not valuable doesn't make for good economics."

Where is the edge in selling premium? What most newcomers miss that is extremely important.,"This is a good assessment of how to efficiently leverage capital for profitability in options writing.

For the folks in the room that might like numbers a little too much, there is another factor in volatility mispricings that arises from the imperfect approximations in the Black-Scholes model — because it assumes the theoretical price movements of a stock to be lognormally distributed, options according to the model are more likely to be overpriced the closer they are to the money, and underpriced the further away they are. This is, for example, part of the reason why iron condors see diminishing returns relative to probability of profit the wider the body gets (the other part is diminishing liquidity causing an increasingly disadvantageous bid-ask fill)."

Word of advice: Stay away from the Gamestop Netflix movie. Its another tool used by the powers that be that'll paint us in a negative light. Trailer has a buzzline about us crashing the economy.,"Just watched it and thought the same. The very last line of the effing trailer is:

Where do millionaires store their currency?,"A couple of different routes.

One, is that you probably don't use a mainstream bank.  In the UK you'd be looking at banks like C.Hoare&amp;Co, Adam&amp;Co, etc.  This doesn't impact how much is protected by the state, but it does assume a lot less risk.  Such banks only work with high value accounts - they're not gambling on subprime markets, etc.

Next up, you can insure your deposits yourself.  The state insures them up to a limit (100k for the eurozone, £85k for the UK) - but there's nothing stopping you taking a private policy for a higher limit.  (Yes, you can insure your bank account - fundamentally you can take insurance on just about anything where the insurance company believes they can calculate the risk.)

Finally, you simply don't keep make-or-break amounts in currency.  The rich stay rich by buying things that appreciate in value, the poor stay poor by buying things that depreciate in value.  Cash is not an appreciating asset - it's simply a buffer between their actual wealth, and their expenditures.

(I should stress, I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just some nerd on the internet.  If this satisfied a curiosity, fantastic.  If you're making actual decisions based on this, you dun goofed.)"

Due to unreliable daycare we've had to hire full-time babysitter as a replacement, ($15/hr, 9 hours per day with some weekend hours too, so over $3k/month compared to less than half that amount for daycare).

It's all temporary though, and we're still maxing out two 401ks, two Roth IRAs and two HSAs. So even though it feels like we're not saving much after taxes, I have to remind myself that's because half of my paycheck doesn't even show up in the bank account. It's a great commitment device."
Started from the bottom and I finally made it! My tips for new traders starting.,"Let me sum up (TLDR version):

1. Let go of your ego. You are small and insignificant
2. Don’t use indicators
3. Read the news.  Be cautious before breaking news.
4. Slow and steady wins the race
5. Understand the risks to larger leveraged trades
6. Fewer is better. Patience is a virtue.
7. Always trade the trend

"I've found an awesome deal on a house I adore, and I checked the tax records and the owner is very behind on their taxes, how does this impact the sale of the property?",That is the job of the title company. They will find out all of that information and pay the back taxes out of the proceeds of the sale. So the seller will get $6K less than what the home sells for. Their job is to deliver a clean title with the home. We are closing on a property this week and the taxes weren't paid for two years and HOA dues were two years overdue also. Title cleaned it all up for us.
How far behind am I at 37 years old?,"It doesn't sound like you're in bad shape at all. I would increase the 401k contribution if you can, or least increase it once you get a house. 60k invested and adding 16k a year, you should have an inflation adjusted ~1.4 mil by 62. Using the 4% rule that would give you 56k a year plus social security for retirement."

To what extent does America subsidize healthcare research for the rest of the world?,"Often it is quoted that the NHS as a monopsony buyer gets a 50% discount on American list prices for drugs. So implicit on this is that the UK is having its drugs research subsidised by Americans. But rather than blame the rest of the world I think the blame has to be with the American healthcare industry which neither has the  buying power of single payer health systems like the rest of the world, nor the theoretical disciplines of a wholely deregulated market but instead sits in-between with the most inefficient way of buying healthcare.

Your stats are great and they make a strong argument based on fact. Unfortunately these are discounted by some boomer anecdote.

What things should a 20-year old do to retire by 40?,"I made it by 37 doing real estate and that included the train wreck that was 2008

Lived super broke for ten years and invested as much of my income back into real estate as I could.  Now 43 and I spend my time doing foster care and working in a wood shop with my preacher wife.
Life is good. 

Spend less than you make and do your best to keep as much as possible and reinvest it in the highest return you are comfortable and knowledgeable about.

Avoid buying things that go down in value.
Avoid debt on things that won’t be worth more in five years.  (Avoid debt all together if you can!)"
Being American and not being able to afford healthcare is one of the cruelest fates that one can have bestowed upon them.,"My bf has been out of work for the last 4 years due to chronic health issues. He was in the same boat…and then we moved to WA, in part of their healthcare system. He is now able to get ‘free’ Medicare insurance, or ‘Apple care’ as we call it.
It’s literally been a lifesaving decision moving to a new state with better healthcare."

Thoughts on non profitable companies?,"I read an incredible explanation once that I’m gonna butcher here, but I’ll do my best...

So with any share, you’ll normally buy at a price that reflects presumed future profits. People talk about P/E, an average share might have a P/E of 15, meaning a break-even price many years in the future. 

Companies that are scaling up attract a higher P/E. Not only do you assume they’ll be around in the future, but that they’ll be much bigger than they are today.
Tech companies that can achieve world domination through the easy scalability of software also attract a P/E premium.
And companies that can dominate a market (eg Amazon) don’t even need to make a profit today, because they’ll have a monopoly in the future that can be monetised. A bit like how Facebook didn’t make money for ages until they figured out how to run ads.


So all of this adds up to a huge valuation because of the assumption of hypergrowth and world domination. Who gives a fuck what profit Uber earn right now if there’s a chance they’ll own the whole planet’s road transport in 20 years time?

"A recession is pretty much guaranteed at this point, is it not?","&gt; The problem is we abused this tool box because we didn’t raise rates properly when times were good so now credit is too cheap

Not true. Central banks aim to adjust the interest rate towards the [natural rate of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rate_of_interest)—where the economy is at the maximum sustainable capacity and inflation is stable (and on target). 

So the question becomes: before COVID, was the interest rate below the natural rate? And the answer is no. If anything, it was likely *higher*, since inflation was below target. There is uncertainty as to where the natural rate was, but the [Laubach-Williams model](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar) says around 1 percent pre-COVID (the [actual rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) was 2.4%).

&gt;where we have printed so much money that inflation is running amuck

There is a lot of uncertainty as to how much of the inflation can actually be attributed to QE and how much to supply chain issues.

[This article from Alberto Cavallo](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2021number3/inflation-dynamics-during-covid-19#9) provides a good overview of some of the inflation dynamics we've seen recently.

So what does this mean going forward?

We don't know much. We don't know when supply chain issues will finally resolve, and we don't know what inflation will look once they do. The Fed will likely begin tightening monetary policy (winding down QE and eventually raising rates), but we don't know high fast or how high. Their most recent projections (mid December) for inflation, interest rates, GDP, and unemployment are [available here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf), which is as good a guess as any. It's very unlikely this causes a recession (especially considering [how strong economic growth](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) looks to be).

So short answer: no, a recession is not guaranteed. It's quite unlikely, if anything."
Here's a stock you asked me to research: PLTR,"It’s one of the most interesting growth stocks, but I simply don’t understand their product. Therefore i’ll never buy into this company. — I also feel like the majority of shareholders are either:

How to make US college more affordable?,"Higher education is expensive due to a [lot of different factors](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/569884/), like the reduction in public funding, which leads colleges to shift costs to students, and government backed loans, which colleges take advantage of to raise prices since students can simply take out a loan. The best way to combat this is to remove government backed loans and replace it with some other form of assistance for lower income students.

To answer the question about free college that other commenter had, free college isn't necessarily bad. It's regressive. People that go to expensive colleges tend to be wealthy themselves so a lot of the funds used for free college would be funneled back into the hands of the upper/upper middle class. There are much cheaper and more progressive alternatives to free college."

- crash - 50% and more

I bought a house in Detroit for 15k…It is now appraised at 425k,"You have some nice low property taxes right now, that’s worth it to stay.

I’m convinced one of the main reasons Nasdaq isn’t careening back to November levels are the macro events like stimulus checks and optimism about vaccinations.

How to reasonably spend £20k without investing?,"If his parents own the house and it's their 'forever' home then fit solar panels and a battery.

And since he's at home during the day he'll be able to use the power to lower bills rather than just export it for a pittance."
